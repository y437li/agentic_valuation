Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found on our website at fiserv.com, for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release and the supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. To better coincide with our planning cycle, we have decided to move our Investor Day to the second quarter of each year. As our last update was in December, our next investor conference will now be held in the second quarter of 2015. We will provide further information toward the end of this year. Let me now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We started out 2014 on a very positive note and are pleased with our results. Performance in the quarter was headlined by excellent internal revenue growth, expanding operating margins and a double-digit increase in sales. Adjusted revenue increased 6% in the quarter to $1.2 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter stepped up to 6%, matching our best quarterly performance since the beginning of 2008. The Payments segment headlined our results with 8% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 11% in the quarter, translating to 120-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% to $0.82, which was driven primarily by strong operating results. Free cash flow per share was up 5%, and we also repurchased 6.1 million shares in the quarter for $351 million. We identified 3 key enterprise priorities at the start of the year to help you gauge our progress. The priorities are : first, continue to build high quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; next, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients. Our strong financial performance was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Company-adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% was compared to flat in the year-ago quarter. We saw strong internal revenue growth across a broad base of our payments, channels and account processing businesses in the quarter. The combination of high quality revenue growth and our focus on operational efficiency resulted in strong operating margin even as we invested in future growth opportunities such as Real-Time, Biller and Digital. As you know, the acquisition of Open Solutions anniversary-ed earlier in the quarter. We are generally more bullish today than we were a year ago and have meaningful market momentum. For example, in the 15 months since the acquisition, we've closed nearly 40 DNA platform decisions, including 7 in the quarter, and expect to see meaningful revenue growth contributions from the new DNA clients as they begin going live in the second half of this year. We also had the largest sales quarter ever for our Weiland Account Analysis solution, which is part of the Open Solutions acquisition. We continue to generate value through solid execution of our cost and revenue synergy plans. Our second priority is to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. We continue to gain traction with our strategic focus on account processing for mid-to-large financial institutions, integrated with a broad array of our market-leading surround solutions. During the quarter, Bank of the Ozarks, with assets of $5 billion, selected Premier from Fiserv for account processing, along with a full suite of add-on solutions including channels, bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the ACCEL network. This win complements our announcement earlier in the quarter that Washington Federal Bank, with assets of nearly $13 billion, selected DNA, integrated with Corillian, Mobiliti and a full suite of our Payment Solutions. Both of these transactions were competitive and highlight the strength of our broad account processing solution portfolio. We continue to make progress expanding our digital presence, adding 51 Mobiliti clients in the quarter, of which the majority will join our Mobiliti ASP platform. ASP subscribers grew 90% over the prior year's quarter and we still believe there's significant growth opportunity ahead. We also have now over 200 institutions live on our new ASP tablet offering. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.  We're excited about the opportunities we see to provide technology solutions, which exist at the intersection of value for consumers and revenue for financial institutions. We believe the proliferation of non-point-of-sale, real-time transactions is a meaningful opportunity against those criteria. We're focused on scaling this opportunity through our Real-Time payment network, where we are deploying proprietary solutions that combine to allow real-time payments to originate and settle in multiple ways. As an example, since our 2013 launch, we now have over 160 institutions offering Popmoney Instant Payments. Yesterday, you may have seen, we announced that U.S. Bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in the country, is now live with our Real-Time person-to-person capability. In addition to creating a new payment category with Popmoney, we also see a tremendous opportunity to expedite a subset of the more than 1 billion bill payments we process annually. We're expanding both the biller and issuer sides of this network to increase options for end-users. And as a result, saw a 20% increase in expedited bill payments over the prior year's quarter. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. Adjusted revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.2 billion. And with the anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition very early in the quarter, adjusted internal revenue growth was also 6%, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. We saw good performance across most of our businesses in the quarter, with stronger results in our payments, channels, account processing and output solutions businesses. The timing of termination fees had a positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter of about 90 basis points, offset somewhat by negative currency fluctuations of about 30 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 11%, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 120 basis points compared to last year. These increases were driven by strong growth in our Payments and Account Processing businesses, as well as continued focus on operational efficiencies, including the Open Solutions cost synergy attainment. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 22% over the prior year to $0.82 per share. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was exceptional, growing 8% in the quarter. Importantly, this growth was driven by strong performance across the majority of businesses in the segment, including debit, bill payment, channels and output solutions. Debit transaction growth of 11% in the quarter was somewhat negatively impacted by weather, consumer spending and the timing of the Easter holiday. And yet, our growth was still up in excess of the market. Bill payment transactions increased 6% in the quarter, bolstered by new client implementations, partially offset by weaker-than-expected results from our largest client. We also added to our Payments footprint, with 30 new debit and 82 new bill payment clients in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $180 million. Adjusted operating margin of 30.6% was up 10 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter. We had solid margin performance in our debit, bill payment and channels businesses. This was partially offset by the business mix in the quarter, including higher output solutions revenue; incremental investments in our new Biller Advantage platform; and important digital investments in mobile business banking, tablet solutions and our new Corillian online ASP user experience. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 4% to $576 million for the quarter, and adjusted internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter. The growth was primarily driven by increases in our Account Processing businesses, including higher termination fees, partially offset by a revenue decline due to timing in our International business and negative currency impacts. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 12% in the quarter to $185 million. Adjusted operating margin performance was particularly strong in the quarter, increasing 230 basis points to 32.1% over the prior year. Revenue mix, scale leverage, operational effectiveness savings, including open synergies, and higher termination fees were the primary contributors to the gains in adjusted operating margin. The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment was $23 million for the quarter, in line with the prior year. We had a couple of nonoperating items in the quarter that had a net positive impact on adjusted EPS. First, our 30% adjusted tax rate in the quarter was lower than anticipated. This resulted in a $0.05 per share benefit in the quarter as compared to last year, due primarily to the timing of discrete tax benefits. As mentioned in our guidance for 2014, we anticipated some quarterly tax rate fluctuation during the year, due primarily to the timing of these discrete items. Although the positive tax benefit hit earlier in the year than we anticipated, we still expect a full year tax rate of approximately 35%, which is similar to last year. For planning purposes, we have assumed that the 2014 R&D tax credit will not be renewed within this year. The other nonoperating impact is that adjusted equity earnings in the quarter was $0.02 per share lower than the prior year, as anticipated, due primarily to recent business dispositions in the StoneRiver venture, which reduces earnings. Free cash flow per share in the quarter was up 5% to $0.90 per share. Results were impacted by the timing of working capital in the quarter. We remain on track for the full year. Total debt at March 31 was similar to the end of December, at $3.8 billion, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which continues to be within our target leverage ratio. We repurchased 6.1 million shares in the quarter for a total of $351 million. As of March 31, there were 12.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase and 251.6 million shares outstanding. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales were strong, increasing 17% over the prior year's quarter. Sales results in the quarter were led by Account Processing, card services and electronic payments. Going into 2014, we increased our overall sales expectations, lifting internal quota by almost 15% over last year's level. We finished the quarter at 96% quota attainment, had a robust pipeline and increased conviction in what we believe will be a very solid sales year. Integrated sales were $52 million in the quarter or 21% of our full year target, which, as you'll recall, also includes the Open Solutions revenue synergy results. Performance was strong across a broad range of solutions including bill payment, debit, statements, Mobiliti and Source Capture. We also continue to be on track in capturing the add-on solution opportunities within the Open Solutions client base. We achieved $17 million of Operational Effectiveness saves in the quarter against our $60 million goal for the year. These strong results were driven by Open Solutions cost synergy attainment and solid execution of our Operational Effectiveness objectives. We're seeing continuing stability in the financial institution market. There were 6 regulatory actions in the quarter versus 9 in the same period last year. While institutions remain focused on the significant regulatory and compliance burden, we are seeing an increased focus on making money. Loan volumes are rising and asset quality is improving. M&A activity is in focus, and we expect that to continue as institutions look to leverage scale and extend their market opportunity. As I said upfront, we're on track to achieve results within our full year outlook across all measures. Our first quarter results were strong against our easiest compare of the year. We believe the second quarter will likely be the most challenging comparison of the year, given the prior year's adjusted internal revenue growth rate, onetime revenue and the anniversary of the TD Bank bill payment implementation. We continue to expect 4% to 5% adjusted revenue growth for the year and 4% to 4.5% adjusted internal revenue growth. Given the first quarter's performance, we now believe our full year adjusted internal revenue growth performance will be more balanced between the first and second half. We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in the range of 10% to 13% for the year, and that adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points. Importantly, we continue to expect 2014 free cash flow per share to be up at least 10% to over $3.65. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. We made measurable progress against our key priorities, and are adding sustainable, high-quality revenue, which we believe will lead to higher internal revenue growth in 2014 and momentum to increase that rate again in 2015. Lastly, in March, we were proud to be named to Fortune Magazine's prestigious 2014 list of the World's Most Admired Companies. We know this is a direct result of the dedication of our more than 21,000 associates around the world, who are focused on delivering exceptional value for our clients. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Michael Landau : Mike Landau in for David. Is high single-digit growth in Payments sustainable through 2014? Jeffery Yabuki : As we said in the discussion, we had a very strong quarter. 8% was our strongest quarter since early 2008. We had a 7% growth rate last quarter. We indicated, as you probably know and we indicated, we had our easiest compare in Q1. So while we do think we'll see stronger growth in our Payments segment for the year, we would not expect that to be at 8% each quarter for the year. We'll expect us to continue to grow our Payments segment growth rate on an annual basis, year in and year out, but we don't think it will be 8% each quarter for the year. Michael Landau : Got it. And can you quantify the expected margin expansion for the Financial segment for 2014? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, we don't give guidance like -- by segment. So we had a really great performance in the first quarter. We're operating very well from the Operational Effectiveness standpoint, and obviously, the cost synergy execution on our Open Solutions transaction continues to be right on plan. So we'll continue to do that. Our margin guidance is -- for the year is greater than 50 basis points, and that's where we're at. Jeffery Yabuki : We're highly confident that we'll achieve that level of performance. Michael Landau : Okay. And just lastly, did you anniversary the impact in the first quarter this year of the large Account Processing client loss last year? Thomas Hirsch : That was anniversary-ed in the prior year. Operator : David Koning from Baird. David Koning : Yes. And I guess, my first question just in Payments, the fast growth, you saw -- Q1, you saw a little deceleration in bill pay transaction growth and in debit transaction growth, which I think are the 2 biggest parts of that business, yet revenue growth accelerated. I think you talked about output revenue getting better in Q1. But maybe you can talk about how those 2 core segments decelerated transactions but revenue accelerated. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think that's one metric there, Dave. What I would first say is that we had a very good quarter in our Payments segment across all areas. And what I mean by that is clearly, bill payment, we talked a little bit about the transaction volume that's one piece of that. Clearly, that was impacted by our largest client, which was lower than what we anticipated, so that drove that down. But we're experiencing double-digit growth outside of that. But we had good growth in debit. Even though it was a little bit lower than the -- than what we had last year, it was still very strong. So we had good performance there. As you well know, it's well above market trends at 11%. And we continue to expect that's going to continue. So again, good growth in debit, good growth in bill payment, our online business, which is both in our channels and Mobiliti, had a very strong quarter. We also had good growth this quarter in our Biller business, which we have a few headwinds going forward in that because we had some client acquisition that will hit us, but we had a good quarter of growth in Biller. And then we did have a good quarter of growth in output. We signed a number of larger new clients. We did have a couple of million dollars associated with a breach that was out there of a card reissue, but that was only a couple of million dollars. So again, we really hit on all cylinders in the quarter. Very pleased with that across a number of different areas. And Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Dave, I would say while we -- while the growth rate in Q1 in bill pay was less than it was in Q4, it was substantially higher than it was last year in Q1. And we also continue to have good success in terms of add-on products, add-on services in some of our existing payments kinds of products. So whether we're talking about -- you take something like expedited bill payment, that's not a new -- that's not -- that transaction itself adds a lot more revenue per transaction, a lot more value per transaction, but isn't really driving the transaction itself. So from that perspective, we're seeing a lot of kinds of add-on in our debit business. We do a lot of stuff on the risk side. And as you might imagine, given a lot of the press in the first quarter, we certainly had focus in those areas. So those are just a couple of examples of where we have good add-on -- kind of add-on products or maybe thinking about it on a dollars-per-transaction basis as well. David Koning : Great, and that's a great recap. And just one follow-up. How did license revenue trend in each of the 2 segments? Thomas Hirsch : You mean in the quarter? It was about flat, with last year up a couple of million dollars, Dave, but nothing substantial. David Koning : Okay. Each segment was pretty flat too and that wasn't... Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, yes. Operator : Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : You guys had a couple of nice wins. One you just announced earlier today or yesterday, and then, the Ozark win, and then, one more that you added at the beginning of your comments. Can you just talk a little bit about why folks are choosing you over other people in the marketplace, if you're hearing a theme? I guess, maybe even other than that you have many products that work together, but is there anything specifically that folks are keying in on? Mark Ernst : Yes, Brett, this is Mark Ernst. I guess, I would say a couple of different things. Clearly, having a variety of different account processing platforms is giving us a competitive advantage in the sense that as we talk to a lot of different financial institutions, they have varying different needs. And the portfolio of account processing platforms that we have give us something that can beat a variety of different FI kind of strategies and what they're trying to do for their customer base. So I'd say that is one thing that clearly stands out that we think is giving us a distinct advantage in the market today. The other thing that I think is almost certainly the case is the wide range of add-on capabilities or surround capabilities that we have. While many of our competitors have sort of a similar portfolio, the truth of the matter is the quality of what we bring to the market, kind of the best-of-breed in many of those surround solutions, gives us a greater kind of advantage when we are going head-to-head, looking at somebody who is interested in making an account processing platform change. Those are the 2 things that really stand out to me. Jeffery Yabuki : Brett, I would also say, to some extent, Mark talked about this at Investor Day, sometimes, I would say the big intangible is momentum. And we have -- we're on a good win streak and bringing in Open Solutions and adding those DNA capabilities has really added a lot of interesting discussion. Not only because it's a different platform, but the whole notion of real time, whether we're talking about a real-time payment or how mobile technologies kind of require real time, that whole discussion, which has been generally limited to the top 50, call it the top 50, top 25 institutions in the U.S., is really starting to make its way through the entire system. And that's helping as well because we've tried to carve out, I think fairly effectively, that space for Fiserv. So I think it's Mark's point, there's a variety of points and then there's the momentum intangible, which is really quite [indiscernible]. Mark Ernst : I would say momentum is clearly something that's on our side in a lot of these markets. And I'm not sure I would call it as much intangible. I think the tangible aspect of that is these are smart -- a lot of smart people in these financial institutions, and they are looking at the kinds of analysis and decisions that others in the market are making and concluding that there's really something very substantive that we're bringing to the market that other people don't have. David Koning : That's helpful. And just one follow-up. Jeff, you mentioned that Popmoney is one of the leading sort of alternative payments outside the card system that you all are using. Are there other meaningful products that you guys sell kind of alongside that, if banks or even merchants are looking for other alternative mechanisms. Or is that -- is Popmoney probably going to be the one that is the dominant sale in that particular need? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so what I had intended to imply, Brett, and I may not have done it justice is, Popmoney as an application, right, to move money from point a to point b, think about that a little bit more on the front end. And then what we were talking about, to some degree, was this notion of the real-time payment network. And we have a couple of ways that we're doing that right now at scale. So we're -- or at -- as we move to scale. So we're using ACCEL and we have a relationship with STAR, so we're using the card networks to move from 1 DDA to another. But we're quite excited, and we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, we've actually built a capability to attach the PEP+ to allow us to use our ACH footprint to be able to move money on a real-time basis. And in fact, that is what U.S. Bank is using to enable their real-time capability through Popmoney. So there are a variety of ways that we can do that. We don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution. We think within the network, we have to have multiple ways to allow people to settle real-time transactions, including a direct connect option, which we're putting a lot of time and energy into on the biller side of our business. Operator : Darrin Peller from Barclays. Darrin Peller : I just want to start off on guidance. When you look at guidance for revenue, I just want to, I guess, touch base on your expectations for the second half again. I know, we've briefly touched on them before. But just, I mean, really given that the first half would suggest about a 5% run rate already. And obviously, you'd seen that new business still coming from -- through the year. You guys have done a lot of them then while signing a number of new deals, especially in the Payments business. Obviously, we also see some pretty good trends across different parts of payments beyond the new deals, whether it's mobile banking or bill pay. I'm just curious to know what would drive -- what would not drive that overall growth rate to be higher than the first half? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I mean, as we talked about, we had a very strong first quarter. We feel very good about the results. They were slightly better than what we expected in the quarter, and that's always good news. We have a lot of good, solid momentum and backlog. And we do expect the second quarter, we have that compare issue, the second quarter versus first. Obviously, Darrin, last year, we had kind of a flat first quarter so this compare is a lot better. But I would say that -- I mean, the primary issue is there's still 3 quarters left in the year. We feel really good about what's going on. We also have seen banks change their priorities and clients change their priorities. And revenue that -- we still have large bill pay implementations coming on that we thought were going to go live last year. And so there's enough that can move around that we think it's prudent to stay where we are right now. We have momentum going in for the rest of the year and let's see where we are at the second half of the year, and we'll obviously make a decision at that point. But we're very bullish, very confident in our guidance for the full year, and we think that's the prudent place for us to be right now. Darrin Peller : That makes sense, makes sense. But just to be clear, I mean, in terms of the number, the new deals you still have coming on, I mean, I know there were a couple on the bill pay business, if you can just -- maybe without mentioning all the names of the clients themselves if that's -- if you're not comfortable doing that, just where are the new businesses coming on, is it mostly bill pay or... Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, no, actually so we've got a couple of good-sized bill pay clients coming on. We have gone live with the large -- the very large bill payment implementation that we knew would go live this year. But we've got a lot of revenue coming on really in the financial segment in the second half of the year from these implementations around DNA, Signature, Premier, a lot of the large bank discussion that Mark shared at Investor Day, we talked about today and the continuing compound growth in our mobile businesses. So it's across the board, but the big propensity of new business in numbers will come on the Financial segment because we had such a strong Account Processing year last year. Thomas Hirsch : That will carry off really into '15, too. Because a lot of those conversions are also happening into '15. Mark Ernst : Later, they're later, really later in '14. Darrin Peller : Right. So just one follow-up on the margin side and I'll turn it back to the queue. But I mean besides term fees, and maybe if you can help us to understand what term fees did to help the margin in the quarter first of all, but then I guess besides term -- are there any other real variables why you wouldn't see, similar to the first question, you wouldn't see margins kind of run at a better rate than 50 basis points for any -- for the rest of the year, given that, obviously, we had such a material expansion this quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think again, Darrin as Jeff indicated, we're in the first quarter. We had a good quarter. Our compares, as you go through the year, as you well know, get much more difficult as we kind of go forward. And our guidance is greater than 50 basis points. So we'll continue to -- our execution on the efficiency side has been strong and we're going to continue to execute in that fashion. And so, we're going to continue down that pathway, our guidance is greater than 50 basis points and that we feel good   about that for the rest of the year and we're on track. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I think the other thing, Darrin, is we had a very strong Q2 last year. Operating -- our operating margin was very high. We had a fair amount of license revenue, a fair amount of term fee revenue. So you have those kinds of things dancing around each quarter. But as Tom said, right, our guidance is at least 50 basis points. And again, we're pretty confident, given we're at the end of the first quarter. Thomas Hirsch : And to answer your question on the termination fees, they went from roughly about $6 million, which is fairly low in the first quarter last year, to about $15 million in the first quarter this year, more in line with kind of our run rate type basis. So that's about $9 million of incremental termination fee revenue mainly in the Financial segment. That was offset, as I indicated, by about $3 million of currency. So those are kind of the impacts in the -- largely, in the Financial segment. Operator : Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer & Co. Glenn Greene : My first question is sort of following up on Darrin's question, but just wanted to be clear, the large bill pay client, did that sort of begin to convert this quarter and was a meaningful driver or how much of a driver of that 8% payments growth was it? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so the large bill payment client that we had talked about that we signed back in 2012, which we knew would go live in January, did go live in January. And that will obviously anniversary next, next -- in January of 2015, so that went live. What we were saying is there were a couple of bill payment clients, larger bill payment clients, that we had anticipated will go live last year that we now see will go live in the second half of this year and anniversary, obviously, into 2015. Glenn Greene : Okay. But was the -- was a meaningful part of that 8 points of internal revenue growth in payments, the large bill pay client that sort of ramped sort of in January? Jeffery Yabuki : It obviously had an impact, right. All growth has an impact. Depending on how you define meaningful, I would say it was measurable but not necessarily meaningful. Thomas Hirsch : And I think, Glenn, what I -- I think the commentary, while not all our revenue is based on transaction volume. You saw the bill pay transaction volume at about 6%. We did say it was kind of double digit outside of our largest client. So that kind of gives you a sense, right, that it's meaningful but not, as Jeff indicated, not something that's over the top. Glenn Greene : Okay, and then, any way to give us some color on how Open Solutions revenue growth looked like? I get the sort of the contracting in the DNA wins but any one sense for certainly what the revenue growth is tracking toward? Thomas Hirsch : The -- I think that Jeff kind of highlighted this. We don't disclose it. But clearly the revenue growth in that business is going to be much stronger in the second half of the year. As we've talked a lot of times, we have been hiring a lot of people on the implementation side. So a lot of these implementations, Glenn, are going to go live primarily in the second half and into 2015. And we do have difficult comps because of the fact that some of the reseller revenue that we haven't opened has gone away as we transition those relationships over to us, along with kind of a low termination fee type total. So first half is going to be more difficult for that particular business, but the second half will be much stronger. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just the last one. The sales growth looked nice, I think it was 17% year-over-year. Any lumpiness, meaning like any large deals that get recognized over a long period of time, or is it pretty broad-based or any way that sort of gives us some color on the components of that sales growth figure? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we had -- I mean, we had a couple of larger deals that we announced like Washington Federal. Washington Federal is kind of a go-live in '15. Bank of the Ozarks, another large deal. I mean, the average, right, the mean size of our deals is absolutely increasing. So that does have an impact in terms of kind of, in quotes, backlog and those kinds of things. One of the reasons why we were able to say in Q4 and now -- Q4 of '13 and now again in this quarter, right, that we're feeling quite comfortable about our ability to have internal revenue growth step up. So we do see that and, yes, there are larger deals that have longer implementation tails, and again, fitting into our overall guidance for this year and our visibility into next. Mark Ernst : To your point about lumpiness. I wouldn't say there's anything lumpy in particular about this quarter's sales. There wasn't any -- aside from the things that we've called out, it's a lot of good performance across almost every part of the business. Operator : Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. A lot of good questions had been asked already. Obviously, the quarter growth was good. Just curious on the pricing front from the new sales, anything surprising there? Jeffery Yabuki : Tien-tsin, did you say on the pipeline front? Thomas Hirsch : No, pricing. Tien- Tsin Huang : No, pricing. Sorry, just pricing, and Jeff, sorry if you can't hear me. I'm at the airport, but just pricing in general. I heard your commentary about revenue transaction were going up [ph] but I think that's more of a mix issue. But what about some of the new deals that you're signing, how does the pricing look there? Mark Ernst : Tien-tsin, this is Mark. I'd say the pricing is not inconsistent with what we've been seeing for the last -- between 3, 4 quarters, so I'm not sure that there's anything that we would call out that's unusual in the things that we saw this quarter. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay, but -- and then, just how would you describe discretionary spending in general among the banks. There's been some mixed data points out there in check land [ph] in general seems like things are quite good here. How would you describe it? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say that it depends on the category in which you're talking about. I mean, I -- if regulatory and compliance is now nondiscretionary, and I would say that discretionary spending is relatively limited. Although we are seeing some interesting activity on the loan servicing side of the house and the larger institutions. I mean, clearly, the big focus is on making money -- beyond regulatory and compliance, making money. But I don't see gigantic levels of discretionary spend. I mean, I'd like to see a lot more discretionary spend. But we are seeing -- we are having a lot of conversations that I think will turn into kind of goodness in -- late in this year and into next year. I mean the pipeline looks good. And even the early pipeline, just the things people are focused on tells me that there's more optimism in terms of where rates will go and how their income statements are going to look over time. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it, got it. And then just -- I know that -- a few questions on the outlook. I get the conservatism early in the year, et cetera. But I just want to make sure, was there anything that's actually slowing or coming in -- or ramping slower than expected that's maybe driving some of that conservatism? I heard something about international timing. Sorry, Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : No, I'm sorry to cut you off, Tien-tsin. I mean, there's nothing strange in our timing, the model. Kind of how we would have modeled the year looks pretty good. We're not seeing any meaningful deals slipping around at these stage -- or at this stage. I would say the thing that is probably most negatively impactful for the remainder of the year is we mentioned when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that we had some acquisitions that had occurred, the clients in our Biller business, and much of that was post Q1. So we'll have some downward pressure on that, but again, built into our guidance. And then the big question is the clients that are going live in the second half of the year. The good news on the majority of those kinds of clients is, given the types of solutions, you're really talking about account processing and the bundle that goes around it, you don't have the real ability to have those slip in material ways. So within a few months, I suspect we're going to be just fine in that area. Thomas Hirsch : I think, just add to that is that as you know, we're very focused on full year performance. And we have some comparability, things that happen with, as you know, license fees or termination fees or other sorts of things. So that's the other thing that's kind of impacting the future. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, the comps aside, the trends definitely look good. Last one, just the buyback activity was pretty strong. I'm assuming no change of philosophy, but should we read that maybe that the M&A pipeline is a little bit smaller perhaps or the appetite is not as strong? Thomas Hirsch : No, I mean, we're -- share repurchase is our capital allocation benchmark, and we're going to continue to execute down that pathway. But we continue to look for different opportunities and mergers & acquisitions and will continue to do so, as that's an avenue of growth for us, and value. So we continue to look there, and we'll continue to do so. Jeffery Yabuki : I think the other thing is, I mean, we're, over a long period of time, right, we're quite focused on repurchasing shares. And when there are times to be opportunistic in the market, we want to take advantage of those opportunities. Operator : Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: A question on your debit card processing growth rate. They continue to come in higher than the underlying growth rates reported by the networks, as you mentioned. Can you parse out for us, kind of remind us of the different drivers of that above-market growth? Is it more the smaller asset-size banks you service are under-penetrated, are you taking share? Is it the Durbin factor in terms of interchange exemption for the small banks leading to more focus or higher growth? Can you kind of help us understand the drivers behind the above-market growth rate? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, it's really -- I would boil it down to kind of 2 areas. We are taking share in -- primarily in the smaller financial institutions, connected to both a combination of kind of the integrated debit value proposition that we deliver and the win rates that Mark was talking about on the -- in the core account processing space. And then, the second piece of that frankly is, again, in the larger -- I'm sorry, in the smaller financial institutions, that's a group that is still kind of, yes, under-penetrated versus the largest institutions in the U.S. And I think, yes, I think over time that will moderate, but there's still a lot of opportunity in the debit business. And the good news in the quarter that we -- one of the good news points in the quarter that we didn't mention is the kind of the Durbin 3, or whatever we want to call it, right, the appeal to keep interchange where it was. I mean, that was good news and I think that will continue to have people get focused back on debit and should, and maybe serve as a little bit of a tailwind for the remainder of the year. Ramsey El-Assal: Well, that was sort of one of my follow-ups. Given the placement of Easter, when this nasty winter weather finally passing, do you see -- is debit growth accelerating a little bit in the final 3 quarters of the year? Jeffery Yabuki : Boy, I mean, it's kind of a little bit of a crystal ball question about consumer spending and GDP and everything else. I mean, why -- I don't think there's any question that retail sales were affected by the weather. At least that's certainly what it appears to be. And since the weather has broken, we have seen better trends in that business. And we'll likely follow the market with the premium that you see. And so if weather stays good and the economy stays good, I mean, I think we'll have some good results. Ramsey El-Assal: Fair enough. You mentioned higher output solution revenues in the quarter. Was this related to -- was this breach-related kind of reissuance or was it sort of separate from that type of activity? Thomas Hirsch : No, it was really separate. It was really the new business side. We really signed some nice clients there. We did have a reissue in the quarter, but that was just a couple of million dollars. I think $2 million to $3 million on that special reissue. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then very one last one for me. Incremental EMV card issuance, are you seeing any more of a demand or any more activity in terms of issuing EMV cards versus mag-striped cards or is it still sort of early days for that in your book? Mark Ernst : Yes, it's still pretty early days. We're having a lot of conversations about that and we're trying to gauge the desire inside of our client base for that kind of reissue. But we're not seeing activity, meaningful activity there just yet. But we are having those conversations. I think that could be a good opportunity for us going into '15. Jeffery Yabuki : And I mean, you look at something like the MasterCard and Target announcement today. I mean, I think EMV is clearly -- whether it's EMV or other kinds of protection vehicles it's -- because that's going to get more and more attention and certainly, we would expect to see that, and frankly, be a beneficiary of that over time. Thomas Hirsch : And our businesses are well prepared to address that need. Operator : Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, nice performance, obviously, in Payments. And it sounds like some of the strategies and the market share sort of positioning and associated gains are starting to pay off, so it's good to see. You made a comment toward the end of your prepared remarks about confidence about 2015 being even an acceleration year. Can you just frame that up in terms of the existing business versus additional customer wins, be they bill pay or, for example, Open Solutions, DNA wins? And maybe also just provide a little color as to perhaps your thinking around Mobiliti and whether that's part of your confidence even as you preliminarily look out into 2015. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it's a great question. So I'll give it a shot and then probably, both Mark and Tom will add to it. It really is a combination of things. I would say our strategy for the last several years has been to focus on bringing in high-quality revenue, and we define high-quality revenue as recurring revenue with good, solid operating margins. Margins that produce free cash flow that we can then reallocate for our shareholders. So we have, frankly, at times, probably to the detriment of what some would have liked us to have done, we tried to shy away from revenue that we didn't think was high quality. But for the last few years, we've been talking about a strategy that allows us to step up our revenue sustainably -- or I would say our internal revenue growth sustainably each year. So this year -- we were 3% last year, our range this year is 4% to 4.5%. And what we've said is we believe that we'll see a step-up in adjusted internal revenue growth again in 2015. Now barring the fact that there's a lot of things going on that we probably can't predict. But right now, everything that we can see would say that would happen. And that will happen for a combination of reasons. It will happen because for the last 3 or 4 years, we've had very strong sales performance. And that's coming on, on a regular basis. Number two, we've actually seen better retention within the client base, a little bit better compression trends and those kinds of things, not gigantic but meaningful in a large base over time. Now that doesn't mean we don't lose clients, because we certainly do. But on balance, we put real energy into that, making sure that we're driving value propositions that deliver that over time. So that's the second item. Third is some of the new types of products that we're talking about, whether they be the mobile ASP business that grew 90% in the quarter. Tom talked about business mobile banking, tablet, our new Biller Advantage technology, new things that are -- that we've been selling, that will begin coming live later in the year, ASP tablet. Those kinds of things. And then, the last is all of these kind of 12-month implementations, 18-month implementations of things that Mark was talking about around our core businesses. I mean it's all coming together. Again, it comes on slow because it's recurring revenue, but it's good, high-quality revenue. Mark Ernst : The only thing I would add to that, because I think that's right, it's adoption rates, it's retention, it's compression, it's bringing on the new business that we've been talking about. The other thing that again, that gives us confidence as we look into the future, continues to be the sales pipeline. This is not just something that's going to run out of steam it really is a kind of momentum around the entire model that we've been building. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, so it's pretty well -- pretty broad-based and pretty diversified it sounds like, with a little bit of tailwind from the macro. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And importantly, I mean it's a whole bunch of things that come together in this model, right? I mean, we're -- we've got 600, 700 different products and solutions, and you've got all of the implementations that have to happen over time. So it is broad-based, there's no easy answer. The only reason why I mentioned it is we are not sitting here today relying on any of the -- at Investor Day, we talked about these breakthrough growth opportunities. We talked about Real-Time and P2P and these things that just can really change our trajectory. We don't -- we aren't relying on that kind of a breakthrough to have these kinds of step-ups. All of that is incremental optionality to our growth rates. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then one mechanical question, and I apologize if it's beyond the scope of this call. But I'm intrigued by the real-time capabilities in Popmoney, and you mentioned U.S. Bank. Can you just talk a little bit about who bears fraud risk on an instant ACH transaction? Is that Fiserv or is that the initiating or the issuing institution? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So the answer to that is it depends on the institution itself. And let me just step back. We are not in the business of taking fraud risk. So that risk belongs to the institution. It's typically going to be on the originating institution. And the originating institutions are setting limits for these real-time transactions based on the models that they have, which tend to look a little bit like credit model. So these are -- we are in the business of creating technology, banks are in the business of taking risk. And so, that does sit there. And I think over time, right, over a longer horizon, building out the models that begin to be able to anticipate the non-POS real-time fraud risk, we think is one of the key measures or one of the key actions that need to be taken. And we're quite involved in how that's going to happen across the -- across our client base who is using that today. But that is one of the key check-off boxes that need to happen for real time to become ubiquity -- real-time non-POS to become ubiquitous, but it really is a pretty intriguing opportunity right now. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And one more if I might just sneak it in as -- maybe it's just a yes-or-no answer, Jeff. Is Mobiliti pricing kind of developing along the lines in the way that you would have anticipated a year or 2 ago? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say it's slightly better today than I would have anticipated it to be a year or 2 ago. Operator : Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I heard most of the call. I missed a few parts, so just a couple of clarifications. On the Payments business, I think the question was asked that bill payment and the debit both decelerated, but the revenue growth in payment upticked 200 basis points. Was that due to outplacement? Or what exactly was that, that caused that increase in payment? Thomas Hirsch : Well, I'll go into that. I think I answered that in the first question, but I'll go through it. I think, Brian, what I would say is in the whole Payments segment, we have a lot of different things in there. So we saw a lot of good growth in our online, our channels business, which is our online and Mobiliti business. Our debit business, while you're right, the volumes grew 11% I think last year, the fourth quarter was around 13%, we still had a very strong quarter for our debit business. Our volume was a little lighter due to the weather and a few other things, but as Jeff highlighted earlier, we have a lot of add-on product sales in the risk area and a whole host of different things in our debit business. So we still had a very strong quarter in debit. We had a very good quarter in our online and Mobiliti business. We had a good quarter in our Biller business, which is our Biller Solutions type business. And we did highlight the fact that a few of our clients are being acquired in that space over the remainder of the year, but we had a good quarter there. Our bill payment business grew 6% on the transaction side but did have a very solid revenue growth quarter. It was kind of brought down due to the fact that our largest client did not really meet expectations from a growth standpoint. We did grow double digit outside of that. And then finally, our Output Solutions business did have a good quarter, primarily tied to new sales. And so overall, we just really hit on a lot of different cylinders there. And the 6% bill payment growth in the quarter, last year, for the full year, we had about 7%. So again, it is a little lower due to the reason I mentioned, but again, we had a majority or -- a vast majority of the businesses in here that really have a good quarter, and so we're very pleased with that start to the year. Bryan Keane : Yes, it sounds like there was a lot of different pieces to it. I just wondering if there was any one leading piece, but... Thomas Hirsch : No, I think, again, that it's across each of those. Mark Ernst : I would say good execution across virtually all of these businesses. Bryan Keane : Yes, yes, I know. I mean, it's always good to hear good news about Output Solutions. So just on organic growth, it sounds like your organic growth for the second quarter will be down, maybe sounds like 3 to 4. And then the average of the first and second quarter, we should expect for the second half of 2014. Did I hear that correctly? And then -- because I guess that means that 6% is likely the highest growth for the year. Because originally, I know last quarter you talked about it being strong. Lowest point being the first quarter and then progressing every quarter throughout, so it just sounds like a different trajectory of organic growth. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Actually, Brian, the -- I think -- first of all, while we don't give quarterly guidance, we did want to remind people that we had a very strong second quarter last year. I think what we actually said this year is we actually expected, because last year's first quarter was flat, we expected actually to have kind of a good, a very good first quarter relative to that performance. In 2013, we indicated that we thought that we would step up. We started with 0 but that we would move up throughout the year and that we would exit at a higher rate. So I mean, I think the best way to summarize it is we feel really good about our performance for the year. We have good visibility into the rest of '14 and frankly, into '15. And we feel like we have a good prospect of being able to step up our sustainable, high-quality internal revenue growth rate in '15 over '14. Bryan Keane : Okay, that helps. And then last, Tom. Free cash flow was flat year-over-year. I think net income was up 17% so just wanted to understand what were the moving pieces there and should we expect free cash flow to match adjusted net income growth of about high single digits? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I mean, we -- our free cash flow per share, I think, is about 10%. One of the things I want to highlight, Brian, was that last year, in the first quarter, our free cash flow was up about 30% over the prior year so we did have a real bang up first quarter last year. We did get impacted in this quarter a little bit on the timing of AR, as you'll see. We actually had a decline. We had stronger growth in the quarter, so our AR was flat. So we had a couple of working capital type items. But it's really timing this year. And so for the full year, we're very confident in our free cash flow per share that we had increasing $3.65. So we're very, very pleased with that. Operator : Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup Investment Research. Ashwin Shirvaikar : A couple of questions to start. One is a clarification with regards to the term fee. I know term fees are a regular part of the business, so just want to kind of quantify, is roughly 100 basis point benefit to financial margins, is that fair if I count that most of it drops down? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, if you count. I mean, it's mainly about $9 million increase over the prior year, so it's a little bit more than that. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I was netting out the currency, I guess. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, it's offset by the currency. But for the company, those term fees were up about -- were up $9 million, as I indicated before. Jeffery Yabuki : You can do the math. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yes, absolutely. And the bill payment, when you mentioned the largest client not meeting expectations in the quarter, is that a multi-quarter issue? Is that -- what happened? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, Ashwin, we had said actually when we gave guidance during the year, we had a question on bill pay. And we had shared that on balance, our largest client had not been growing at the rate that we would like. And I mean, I think everyone is aware of the strategic choices that are being made there. And from that perspective, we are a little bit pensive about what that growth rate will look like moving forward. So I think it is a little bit of a -- let me say it a different way. It is -- it is not an anomaly in the quarter. We think it's something that is going on with the institution. We've kind of accounted for it in our numbers, right, it's part of why our numbers are where they are. We're -- we have an intimate relationship with the bill payment numbers for all of our clients and so we're pretty good at predicting what's going on. So I think we're comfortable with what is going on there and have embedded it in our guidance for the year. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Right, right, understood. I was just trying to figure out if there was a reason you highlighted that particular reason. I guess one thing I worry about sometimes is when you talk about Real-Time, and that's pretty good opportunity. But is there a way to think of what these real-time transactions are replacing to the extent they're replacing other non-real-time transactions that you do yourselves. I mean, what's your net transaction growth and how does that, from an economic standpoint, translate to revenue growth? Jeffery Yabuki : I mean, good question. We'll give a quick answer because it's probably longer than we can cover here. But on balance, there are 2 kinds of real-time transactions that we're thinking about right now. We're thinking about around Popmoney and P2P. Now keep in mind, that's a new payment category. So you're going from check and cash to an electronic transaction. So that's an incremental electronic transaction. And then for folks that are selecting real time, that's basically incremental revenue per transaction. So we think that's kind of a -- that category itself has to be established. It's not replacing anything. The other area, and frankly, one of the areas that I'm personally very bullish on, and is what we categorized as expedited payments in our bill payment business. As you know, we have about 1.3 billion transactions a year. So those are existing transactions. And what we're doing is we're making available to a bill-payment user the opportunity at their option and at their expense to move money same day. And so you're not replacing anything. You're basically just adding revenue per transaction that the user wants, they're deeming it to be valuable. Institution shares in that revenue, it's an existing transaction. I actually believe that to the extent that we get expedited to take off, it will actually bring in more opportunity, more transactions per maker than we're having now because people would be more reliant. It basically is a strategy of allowing the users to move money at the speed of their choice. And that's -- that is fundamental to our long-term payment strategy. Ashwin Shirvaikar : That's very useful. If I can sneak one last one in. At your Investor Day, you've kind of talked about, obviously, account processing for large institutions. And I think at that time, for last year, it was sort of -- you had 5 or 7 deals. I was just wondering post 1Q, how does the pipeline for [indiscernible] account processing for large institutions? Mark Ernst : Yes, it looks fine. I wouldn't say it's gangbusters but I think that's more a reflection of the fact that -- for that, in that category, I think that's more kind of just a reflection of the sort of episodic nature of large institutions and how they think about making changes. But we've got a nice pipeline and continue to have lots of great discussions. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Ashwin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations teams. Have a great afternoon. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Results for the second quarter were solid, in line with our expectations and on track to achieve our full year financial outlook. And as you saw in our press release, we also moved up the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter was 3% against our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.6%, an increase of 10 basis points over last year's quarter and up 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% over last year's second quarter. We feel very good about our results for the first half of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth through June 30 is 4% compared to only 2% in the first half of last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the first 6 months is up 15%, and free cash flow per share is up 16%, both of which reflect our commitment to growth through high-quality revenue. Sales through June 30 are up 5% over the same period last year. Our pipeline is growing at a strong clip, and we are poised for stronger performance in the second half of the year. Now let me update you on our enterprise priorities. As a reminder, our 3 focus areas for the year are : first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients. To our first priority, we are building momentum through high-quality internal revenue growth, expanding margin and growing free cash flow per share. We delivered 3% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter against our toughest revenue comparison of the year, and are now 4% for the first half. Payments led our internal revenue growth performance with 5% and 7% growth for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Adjusted EPS is up 15% year-to-date over last year's strong earnings result. Execution is solid across the business. Through June 30, we achieved a 60-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin and a 16% increase in free cash flow per share, all this as we continue to invest in your company. We are well on track to achieve our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Our second priority is to extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. We had over 4,000 attendees at Fiserv Forum, 1 of our 2 primary client conferences in May. This event, which has become one of the largest in the entire FinTech industry, is proving to be an important opportunity for clients to network with other industry leaders, exchange ideas and gain insights into market and industry trends. As important, the forum is a great opportunity to showcase our market-leading solutions and latest innovations to decision-makers, prospects and industry pundits. At last year's conference, one of the solutions introduced to our clients was our ASP tablet banking solution, which enables financial institutions to provide a differentiated experience to the more than 60 million tablet banking users in the U.S. today. Since then, 16% of our Mobiliti ASP clients have begun to offer this solution. At this year's event, we introduced Mobiliti Business, which goes live this year. This ASP solution allows our financial institution clients to provide their business customers with a compelling suite of mobile capabilities such as remote deposit capture, entitlement, payment initiation and approval. Interest is very strong across the nearly 1,200 institutions using our business online services today. We're excited about helping our clients address the digital needs of this strategically important customer segment. We expect to see meaningful revenue growth from this user-based subscription offering over the next several years. During the quarter, we also signed an additional 72 institutions to Mobiliti for a total of nearly 1,900 mobile clients. Mobiliti ASP subscribers have grown more than 175% year-over-year to over 2.2 million subscribers, which is also up about 15% sequentially. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients. In the quarter, Australia-based Westpac Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, was recognized as having the leading online and digital design for its transformative digital platform built by Fiserv. This prestigious award, known as the Good Design Award, evaluates technology -- technologies across all industries, not just banking, and Westpac's solution was selected as a winning design for 2014. Their new Corillian-based Online Banking service, branded as Westpac Live, is a one-of-a-kind solution utilizing state-of-the-art design principles, coupled with modern technology to provide a consistent, simple, helpful and secure omnichannel customer experience through a single platform. We continue our focus on real-time money movement as a way to drive meaningful differentiation in client value. We are building a new type of payments ecosystem using several of our leading solutions to create a one-of-a-kind network that allows end-users to simply and easily use payment speed to their advantage. At our most recent Investor Day, we presented a number of targeted strategies to accelerate growth outside the U.S. over the next several years. Earlier this month, we launched Agiliti, a cloud-based retail bank technology solution. This modularized account processing-based solution is designed to enable new players as well as existing institutions to better manage their technology costs, rapidly bring products to market, enhance the digital experience, and overall, enable institutions to focus their effort on serving customers. We've teamed up with Anthony Thomson, the cofounder and former Chairman of Metro Bank and the Chairman and cofounder of The Financial Services Forum to combine U.K.-based expertise and credibility to this new powerful solution. In a very short period, we have seen strong demand, leading to commitments from multiple institutions, including Think Money Limited, to use our new solution. Agiliti is scheduled to go live in mid-2015. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was 3%, solid results given the difficult prior year compare and the strength of our first quarter's performance. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue was $2.3 billion, and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, a meaningful acceleration over the prior year's growth rate of 2%. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $360 million, and for the first 6 months, was up 7% to $702 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 10 basis points over the prior year to 30.6%, and increased 100 basis points sequentially. For the first 6 months, adjusted operating margin is up 60 basis points compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in our scale businesses and operational efficiencies, including Open synergies. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.81 in the quarter, and for the first half of the year, is up 15% to $1.63, both compared to the prior year period. Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $591 million in the quarter, and for the first 6 months, increased 7% to $1.2 billion, with only $2 million of acquired revenue year-to-date. The strength in our larger recurring revenue businesses such as card services, bill payment and channels, along with good performance from output solutions, drove the majority of the revenue growth. The decrease from the first quarter's growth rate was primarily due to more difficult second quarter compare; the annualization of a large client win at the end of the first quarter; and a negative impact from the Biller headwinds we shared with you earlier in the year, which stemmed primarily from client acquisition. We signed 88 new bill payment clients in the quarter and 170 through June 30. Bill payment transaction volume grew 3% in the quarter and 5% in the first 6 months. Strong new client growth was partially offset by the anniversary of our largest 2013 bill payment implementation in the first quarter and continued soft transaction volumes at our largest client. We expanded the number of member institutions in the Popmoney network in the quarter, and now have over 2,200 institutions contracted to offer these services. Transactions were up 73% in the quarter, and we continue to see important growth opportunities, in particular, as clients enable real-time capability for their customers. We have a strong pipeline for Popmoney Instant, including notable opportunities with several top 50 financial institutions to join the more than 170 financial institutions signed today. Debit transaction growth was 11% in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. We added 26 new debit clients in the quarter, and have signed 56 for the first 6 months of the year. New sales, better-than-market transaction growth and value-added services combined to drive strong, continued revenue growth in our card services business. Payments segment adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $185 million. And year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 6% to $365 million compared to the prior year periods. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 70 basis points on a sequential basis to 31.3% in the second quarter, but down 70 basis points compared to the prior year, which was our highest overall margin quarter over the last 4 years. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points to 30.9% over the prior year's high watermark. Margin performance is driven by operating leverage in our scale businesses, offset by continued investments in areas such as Mobiliti and Biller Advantage, the margin mix associated with higher revenue growth in output solutions and Biller headwinds mentioned earlier. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 1% in the quarter to $596 million, and is up 2% to $1.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year, both compared with the prior year periods. The adjusted internal revenue growth rate in the segment of 1% in the quarter declined sequentially, primarily due to lower growth from fee revenue, including license and termination fees and the expected weakness in our International business. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by growth in our Account Processing businesses, partially offset by the timing of larger international client implementations in 2013, which create a very difficult year-over-year comparison, which should abate as we go through the second half of the year. Our large core Account Processing implementation, including Open Solutions, are progressing well. We expect increased revenue from these new clients across a variety of our market-leading solutions towards year end and even more as we move into 2015. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 6% in the quarter to $203 million, and is up 9% to $388 million through June. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the segment was stellar, up 170 basis points in the quarter to 34.1%, and up 200 basis points to 33.1% for the 6-month comparable period. Results were driven by growth in our Account Processing businesses, benefits of operational efficiencies, higher termination fees, partially offset by international headwinds. The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment for the second quarter was $28 million. The increase in expenses was primarily due to the implementation of a new HR system, rolling out during the second and third quarters of this year, along with the timing of expenses associated with our spring client conference. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was up to 36%, higher than the prior year's adjusted rate, primarily due to the impact of the nonrenewal of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Through June 30, our effective tax rate of 33.1% was lower than the prior year, with the difference driven by the timing of discrete tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2014. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half, and that our full year tax rate, excluding the tax impact from StoneRiver Capital transaction, will be under 35%. We received a $45 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture in the quarter, which is excluded from our free cash flow performance. The year-to-date adjusted earnings contribution from StoneRiver decreased by $6 million, or a $0.02 negative EPS impact, as StoneRiver continues to opportunistically monetize its business portfolio. The performance of this equity investment has been exceptional. In fact, since the formation of the StoneRiver venture in 2008, Fiserv has received total cash payments in excess of $850 million. We continue to see attractive growth in free cash flow as one of the outcomes of our focus on high-quality revenue. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year reached nearly $400 million, increasing 10% over the prior year period. This performance, again, which does not include the $45 million from StoneRiver, translated to $1.54 in free cash flow per share, a very strong 16% increase. Total debt at June 30 was $3.8 billion or 2.3x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3 million shares of stock in the quarter for $168 million. Through June 30, we have deployed $519 million, repurchasing 9.1 million shares at an average cost of $57 per share. This is double the allocation of capital to share repurchase compared to the first half of 2013. At quarter's end, there were 249.1 million shares outstanding and 9.4 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. Sales for the quarter were a bit lighter, following up on a very strong Q1. We attained 80% of our quota in the quarter and are now at 88% year-to-date. As you will recall, we have increased our sales targets in each of the last several years. Importantly, actual sales value through June 30 is still up 5% over last year's level. Our sales results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the timing of several larger transactions that slipped out of Q2 and signed early in the third quarter. As an example, we completed a large sale in July, with total contract value of more than $50 million to a top 10 financial institution to serve as a large share of their substantial consumer loan portfolio. We're excited about this new relationship and expect the solution to go live late in 2015. Our June 30 qualified pipeline is up 19% since the start of the year. The strength is coming primarily from continuing momentum in large Account Processing transactions, early traction in our focused international strategies and progressively larger transactions across our solutions. Also, DNA platform sales were again strong, with 6 new clients signed in the quarter. Since we acquired the business last year, we have added 44 new clients to DNA, and we fully expect that momentum to continue. Integrated sales were $50 million in the quarter, and totaled $102 million through the first half of the year. Card services, bill payment and Mobiliti led the integrated sales performance in the quarter. Through June 30, nearly 20% of our integrated sales, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, have come from the DNA client base. We are on track to achieve our $250 million integrated sales target for the year. We've also realized $37 million of Operational Effectiveness savings in the first 6 months in the year, or 62% of our $60 million annual target. The strong results are driven by Open Solutions cost synergy attainment and operational improvements. Going forward, we expect the growth in the incremental savings associated with Open Solutions to slow as we have substantially completed our cost-focused integration efforts beyond the data center consolidation. We remain well positioned to meet our Operational Effectiveness objective for the year. The environment continued to show stability in the quarter. There were 9 regulatory actions in the period and 15 year-to-date, a decrease of 40% compared to the first half of last year. We are also seeing healthy M&A activity in the market, which we view as a generally positive sign. Technology spend continues to be focused on cost effectiveness, digital experience and regulatory compliance. While we do not expect overall technology spend for the year to increase over our original estimates, institutions remain committed to their spending plans, which is an improvement over the trailing-off we have seen over the last few years. Lastly, we continue to see a strong interest by financial institutions in solutions that can help generate new revenue. As I mentioned upfront, we are well on track to achieve our full year financial outlook. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 5%, and adjusted internal revenue to grow 4% to 4.5% for the year. And for reference, we expect termination fees in the second half of the year to be about flat to last year's level. Based on the strength of our first half results and what we can see for the remainder of the year, we've increased the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.03 per share. We now expect adjusted EPS to grow in a range of 11% to 13% or $3.31 to $3.37 per share. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points for the full year. And finally, we expect free cash flow per share to increase by at least 10% or greater than $3.65 for the year. We're at a strong position as we enter the second half of the year. We are executing well on our core businesses, and are extending our momentum in areas of new and existing market demand. We are progressing on our journey to steadily increase our adjusted internal revenue growth rate through the addition of high-quality revenue. We are on plan for the year and believe our growth momentum will continue into 2015. Our achievements are not accidental. We have the benefit of 21,000 associates around the world who care deeply about clients, are meeting commitments and remain focused on delivering innovation and excellence each and every day. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Condra from BMO. Paul Condra : I just -- I thought I'd ask first about the DNA implementation. I just wondered, is there anything with timing that we should be paying attention to or any change to that rollout? Jeffery Yabuki : No, I mean, we are on track on those implementations. We mentioned we've got 44 wins so far. We had right around 30 last year, and those are tracking well, and those will begin to go live really in the second half of this year and more towards the end and then well into 2015. And at this pace, we would expect that to continue beyond 2015, so it's right on track. The great news, Paul, that I would add to that is, it's not just the DNA implementations but the amount of revenue uplift that we're seeing from surround solutions in the DNA base and in the Open base, in particular, continues to be very positive. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that fully 19% -- 19%, 20% of our add-on integrated sales in the quarter or for the year-to-date have come from DNA clients, so we're quite pleased with that and just well on track. Paul Condra : Okay, great to hear. Just following up, I wondered if you could talk a little broadly just about margin expansion. The quarter looked strong, but I'm wondering if you can talk about how you balance kind of revenue growth with margin expansion. Is there any -- anything we should be paying attention to as you move internationally as well? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it's a great question. I mean, I would say that we have been very, very disciplined on focusing our energy on what we described as high-quality revenue. And that we described that revenue as being generally recurring revenue, revenue that fits into our model. It's things that we do for clients on an everyday basis, and it tends to come -- that revenue tends to bring along attractive margins and, frankly, very high free cash flow characteristics. And as we thought -- and that's been our model in the U.S. And frankly, we buy it for that. We would prefer to grow a little bit more measured but grow in that way as opposed to achieving growth for growth's sake. And we've taken that same formula outside the U.S. When we shared at Investor Day last year the areas in which we were focused on growing this Account Processing cloud-based solution that we talked about called Agiliti, right, that's outsourced Account Processing. We know how to do that. We're building a scale model and we're focused on that. And then it's payments and channels, which we define as mobile and online. All things that we do today, things that we think have those \"high-quality\" revenue growth characteristics, and that's really where our focus is, is, has been and will continue to be. Operator : Darrin Peller from Barclays. Darrin Peller : Tom, maybe -- can you give us some more specific color on the onetime moving parts around the quarter, especially with regard to the deceleration of growth versus the fourth quarter -- first quarter levels? If you could just list them for us and then maybe help us understand what impact they actually had on the Payments and Financial growth rates as well as maybe the margins in the quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, are you talking about onetime fees, Darrin? Darrin Peller : Yes, I guess -- I know there was a lot of noise around the grow over, right, as you I think alluded to in your prepared remarks, so the comps were harder. Maybe just give us the components to that. And then maybe if there's any other onetime items, how those impacted the growth rate and what those growth rates would be sort of more normalized for any segment? Thomas Hirsch : Okay. I'll start with that and then turn it back over to Jeff. But I think if you look at the first quarter of 2013, we had 0% growth when you look back to last year. And in the second quarter of last year, we actually had 4% growth, which was our strongest quarter last year in Q2. We had 7% growth in the Payments segment and actually 2% in Financial. So this is really -- while we looked at the year and while we rolled off the year, this was our most difficult kind of comparison on a year-over-year basis. So we're very pleased with our second quarter results from a growth rate standpoint given that compare. We also had some annualization of our -- like our largest bill pay client in the first quarter. We have difficult international comparisons in the first half of the year, which will start abating in the second half. And we have some momentum as we head into the second half in some of the larger core implementations. In regards to what you mentioned around onetime fees, we've had, year-to-date for the first 6 months of the year, license and termination fees are up roughly about $15 million, Darrin, and about $11 million or so of that was in the first quarter and about $4 million of that in the second quarter. So again, we had a little bit more benefit in the first quarter from those and less in the second quarter, and that contributed a little bit to the deceleration when you look at it comparing to the first quarter. But as you know, those fees bounce around. Jeff indicated in his prepared remarks in the second half, license termination fees are probably going to be flat to the prior year. And that's just generally where we see that right now. So that would be from a high level. And Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, the only thing I would say, Darrin, is, and we talked about this a lot in April when we shared our results from Q1. I mean, we fully expected Q1, on a relative performance basis, to be by far the strongest of the year because, as Tom mentioned, we had a 0 compare. We expected this to be the hardest. And so it's worked out as we expected. We're right on our internal plans and some of the significance of the performance delta that we had to get over versus last year's Q2 and then the kind of a very strong Q1 makes it a little bit more difficult to see the underlying growth, kind of the puts and takes on that. But we feel like we're going to see the reacceleration in the second half of the year on the segments, just given the compare differential on a regular basis. And then we're going to, of course, add on some of the additional implementations that we've been talking about. So again, to summarize, we think the year is looking exactly the way we thought it would when we gave guidance at the beginning of 2014. Darrin Peller : Sure. No, that's helpful. I think the reason I made -- to your point, the reason I was asking is really to get to what the normalized growth rate underlying this really is. And it sounds like, look, in the first half of the year, you're coming at 4% internal growth. As you said, I mean your guidance is 4% to 4.5%, but you're also looking for an acceleration as easier compares come about, not to mention all the roll-on from DNA and other businesses you've won that are actually going to be generating revenue in the second half of the year. So I guess just to that point, your guidance being left unchanged at 4% to 4.5%, when you're already at 4% without the benefit of all of these businesses that have yet -- that are yet to roll on, is that just some conservatism in your outlook or is there any sort of moving parts? Because it seems like that should add a fair amount of revenue versus the first half levels. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say there is one other thing. We had talked, and you'll remember this well, Darrin, we had talked at the beginning of the year that we would have headwinds coming from our Biller businesses. And while we've had some of those in the first half, we actually think that will actually grow a bit in the second half of the year and end up shrouding some the growth that we would otherwise see blowing through to the bottom line. But we would also -- if we talked about it in terms of the elements of '15, we've got the large implementations that we talked about both on the core and on the bill payment side. We've got the benefits coming from Open Solutions, the international performance that Tom talked about in terms of that moderating, going live with Agiliti. Now again, Darrin, I'm talking about going into '15, right, we're going to have those benefits. So we've been quite pleased with how our pipeline has grown, up 19% so far this year, and that's coming on the heels of a number of, as you remember, a number of large deals at the end of last year and a very, very strong first quarter. And then we also think we're going to have some benefits come through in '15 relative to EMV. There's been more discussion going on in EMV. We expect to have those benefits there. And then we'd hoped that all of that or we'd expect that all of that would turn into accelerated growth into '15 and actually, we believe that we'll probably hence see our free cash flow move up to a little bit north of $1 billion next year. So again, focused on growth acceleration in a high-quality way. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's helpful. Just one last question, and I'll turn it back to the queue. On the margin side, I mean you had very good expansion on the Financial segment. The Payments side was obviously down, and I'm not sure I quite caught the reason for that. Maybe it was due to some of these onetime issues or maybe not. But just understanding in the second -- maybe if you could answer that. And then in the second half of the year, the margin again. I mean when you roll on new business, such as the DNA businesses that we've talked about, are those -- how accretive is that to your margin when you actually start to execute and implement the business and start to generate revenue off of the work you've done over the past 6 months? Thomas Hirsch : It's high, Darrin, from a standpoint of, again, the scale that we have in those businesses, especially in our card services, bill payment related business. The thing that we had this year, which we talked about briefly, was we are investing more in areas like Mobiliti. Jeff mentioned a number of different -- our tablet offering, our Mobiliti business offering. We also have Biller Advantage, which was something that we acquired in our Biller business that we've invested in. And then we've had a little higher growth associated with our Output Solutions business, which has a little lower margin mix for that. And also, we talked a little bit about our Biller headwinds. Those are kind of hitting us here in the second quarter and in the second half a little bit from a standpoint of some client acquisition that we had, and that's also impacting our margins. So we have very good growth from a scale standpoint in those businesses as that revenue goes on. We have some investments that we're making in a number of different areas, and then we have a little mix differential at Output and then these Biller headwinds that we kind of talked about through client acquisition. So that gives you a little flavor for what's going on. Operator : Dave Togut from Evercore. David Togut : I apologize I joined the call a little late from another call, but maybe you could just dig in a little bit on DNA. The uplift you're seeing in booking, to what extent do you think that, let's say, an improvement in market demand versus share gains? And to the extent it is share gains, if could you give us some insight, perhaps on your head-to-head competitive win rates versus Symitar, which has long been your strongest competitor in the large credit union market? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so I would say that it is share gains in terms of we're winning more than our fair share of new clients. In fact, DNA, DNA has quite strong win-loss ratio when it's out -- when we're out there competing against the market. For the most part, we are not winning -- we are not winning at the level certainly we would like to versus Symitar. We are winning more from other competitor. But you can be sure that we're very focused on what are the right ways for us to make sure that we win against all clients that are out there. Frankly, I would say, David, that we've won a lot of business. We're at roughly 44 wins on the DNA platform to date since the time of acquisition. And frankly, that's a lot of new business. And there are clients that we know that are waiting on the sideline, waiting for us to have these clients go live and waiting for us to -- not waiting for us, but waiting to see that we're able to service this significant demand. So that is a very important element of how the competitive dynamic will play moving forward. We're very focused on operationally making sure that we get these clients live, that they're happy and referenceable on Day 1. But the other thing that I would say that's quite important is DNA is not just a credit union platform. It is a very well-respected platform on the bank side as well as on the credit union side. In fact, you'll remember that in Q1, we won a very large transaction called Washington Federal Bank, which is now a $13 billion bank in the Pacific Northwest, who bought the DNA platform and then bought basically our entire suite of surround. We are having a lot of success on the bank side as well as on the credit union side. So I'm actually quite confident that we will see both of those sides of the charter wars, we'll see big wins coming -- big fair gains coming on both sides of that. And we believe we're the only provider in the industry who can offer a variety of platforms that meet the needs of individual institutions. So DNA is not always the right platform, and XP systems may not always be the right platform, and Premier may not always be the right platform, or Signature. We have platforms that meet the needs of the institution and can help them grow as they decide in terms of what is their strategic plan and how they prefer to do business. David Togut : That's very helpful. If I can just segue into your Operational Effectiveness performance, 62% year-to-date. Are you signaling that you're going to significantly outperform on that $60 million cost takeout target for this year? Thomas Hirsch : No, we continue to be on track towards that, David. We continue to execute well. We knew the first half was going to be a little stronger just from the standpoint of the Open synergies. We're well on track to slightly exceed that target on a separate basis, so we're very pleased with that. And the first half is going to be a little stronger because of those Open synergies. So we're well on track for the year, though. David Togut : Got it. And just a quick final question on the 88% quota attainment for the year. Where do you expect to end up for 2014 as a whole? Jeffery Yabuki : 100%. I mean we expect to be right on target. The pipeline is quite strong. We mentioned that we had -- we really just had a couple of deals slip from the end of Q2 into Q3. We indicated that we had a $50 million transaction closed in July. So we're feeling quite good about that. Operator : Adam Dahms from Robert W. Baird & Co. Adam Dahms : I think most of my questions have been answered. Maybe if I could just ask about the bill pay transactions. I know you called out the anniversary-ing of a large client kind of contributing some of that deceleration. Is it fair to look at this 3% as kind of a normalized run rate? Or was that, that client acquisition, is that a headwind that might have lowered that a little bit? And then maybe if you could just talk about how revenue growth is kind of trending relative to the transaction growth, that would be great. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, sure, Adam, thanks. So let me start and Tom or Mark, you can add to it. I mean we do not believe that 3% would be the normalized run rate. We have a couple of things going on in the quarter that Tom talked about. We had the annualization of our very large implementation last year, which has a little bit of a growth rate impact. We have some trailing off of transactions again in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter from our largest client. And so that's going to have an impact. That said, we also have a series of new clients that have been going live. We've got a couple of larger implementations that will go live in the second half of the year biased more towards Q4. And so we're excited about that. For that business, when you look in the underlying numbers, we had a number of clients that went live in the last 1.5 years or so. They're growing very nicely. We've got a variety of different growth drivers around the industry, and we're quite pleased with some of the expedited payment focus areas that we have that we see accelerating growth. We've got the integration between digital and our transactional capabilities, so we're happy with that as well. And as we talked about at Investor Day last year, this mid-market area, where we're really focused on in terms of bringing a combination of channels, capability and payments capability to market, really penetrating this odd segment of the market, where we have not -- we're kind of below our level of market share. So we do know that in order for us to grow, we've got to be able to win transactions. And also, we're working on several things from a platform perspective that we believe will increase transactions. And we hope -- or I'm sorry, we expect that transaction growth will end up increasing. We think it should be. It should follow consumer household transactions. That's an important element of our growth strategy and, frankly, our use and adoption strategy that we've articulated at our last Investor Day. Adam Dahms : That's really helpful. And then maybe a little bit on the revenue growth in this area. Is that sort of in line with transaction growth? Or are some of these large clients maybe making that a little bit lower? Thomas Hirsch : No, I would say, overall, we don't comment on client revenues for a specific business, but it can be a close approximator, kind of indicator from that standpoint. But there are many things that we work on to clearly maximize our revenue per transaction in our businesses and continue to focus on that. So I would say overall, over a period of time, it's an indicator clearly and just one of those indicators. But that business continues to grow nicely for us. Operator : Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Two questions. One on Popmoney. Can you give us a sense -- I know it's still a small piece of revenue and I know it's growing rapidly, but can you give us a sense of how much -- is it enough yet to be a meaningful part of the growth? Like can we talk about it being 50 basis points of growth? I mean anything like that. Or are we not there yet? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say that, to your point, it's growing rapidly. It is scaling up, but I would say that it's still early to talk about it in terms of the direct \"Popmoney\" impact. We're actually seeing a lot of very intriguing impact on the real-time aspect of Popmoney. So we're seeing pretty intriguing changes in revenue per transaction. And so a little bit to the last piece of the discussion, we've got transaction growth and we also have rev for tran that's looking pretty interesting. But I would say it's still early and it's premature in the scope of all of Fiserv, right, just because of the sheer size and magnitude of the overall company. Brett Huff : And given -- this is sort of the second part of the question, I forget what you said about how many you have installed and how many you have contracted to be installed. When you do that math and assume some average run rate of the kind of transactions and the ARPU you see now in Popmoney and translate that into what is contracted and yet to be installed, after those installations happen, does it reach -- I presume it will happen over the next year or however long they will, at that point, does it reach enough of a threshold to start impacting sort of total company basis points growth that we could talk about? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, I think I would anticipate that if it's not '15, it will be '16. But I do think at that stage, there'll be enough momentum in the solution that it will then start to be breaking that out. And that's one of the things that we talked about as kind of a little bit of an optionality element to the Fiserv -- to a share of Fiserv stock. Right now, it's not having any meaningful impact on our growth rate, but we do expect going into '15 and certainly into '16, that with the combination of Popmoney, the number of call it 2,200 institutions, as well as the real-time aspect, we do believe that at that point, we will see meaningful impact coming from that solution. And again, Brett, our belief is that it won't be linear, right? That in fact that solution will grow. It will hit a tipping point, and you'll see some significant growth come from it for a few years, not unlike what you saw happen with RXP back in the day. Brett Huff : And then just one last one on this. Any change in behavior on those institutions that have offered this relative to bill pay? Are we still paying some things in bill pay as a consumer and some in Popmoney? Are the use cases overlapping or are they remaining separate? Jeffery Yabuki : The use cases are overlapping, but the way that the institutions are for the most part presenting the capability requires a little bit of that siloed impact -- siloed behavior. But the use cases, in the use cases, Popmoney looks more like a bill pay technology than it does a splitting dinner tab technology in terms of how the money is used. I mean we're working on a series of different use cases that we think intermediate those solutions and ways that we can make it easier for consumers to access that. And we'll talk a little bit more about that into next year. But the manner in which it is presented to consumers does not mirror the way consumers use that technology today through their financial institution. Operator : Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I guess as a follow-up to that last sort of line of questioning, on the real-time payment typically, I mean, when you're selling in Popmoney to a new customer, is there -- is real-time something that is sort of can be baked into the sale or is it a separate sales cycle? And I guess is it also more complicated implementation, real-time versus just sort of vanilla Popmoney? Jeffery Yabuki : So that's a good question. Back in the day, you may remember when we first started selling P2P, we were really focused on building the network. So let's get that network as big as we can get it, as many institutions as we can. And that predated real-time. So now we're needing to go back in, and for institutions that have made their Popmoney selection, we're looking at adding real-time. And to date, we have about 170 different in Popmoney Instant, we call it, Popmoney Instant installations. And that ranges from institutions as in the top 5 down to institutions that are the average community-based institution. So that is a \"resale.\" When we are selling a new institution today, and we are still selling many new institutions today, we look at bundling it together. So take Popmoney, add on Popmoney Instant. And by the way, while you're doing that, because you are in fact a CheckFree RXP user, we'd like to make sure we add expedited payments into bill pay. In fact, today, we still only have of our probably close to 3,500, 4,000 institutions, we still only have about 1,600 of those institutions live on expedited bill payment today. All of those kinds of add-ons increase the value that the financial institution is able to deliver to their consumer and also changes the fees in which we're able to get paid. So the bank gets paid and we get a slice of what the bank gets paid. So we're really excited about that because we see this intersection between bank or financial institution value, consumer value, and fees to us. The second part of your question, I believe, was around, is it a harder install? It's not a harder install but it is an additional install. And the institutions have to decide how do they want to take real-time? Do they want to use card rail for it? Or do they want to use PEP+ or ACH technology on a real-time basis? Do they want to do all of that? Do they want differences? And so that's the decision that the institutions are making, and we're seeing institutions choose, pick and choose based on how they are currently looking to basically wire the solutions together. I think by the middle of next year, people -- the institutions won't be making those decisions. We'll be providing them this real-time network, this real-time ecosystem that we talked about in our prepared remarks. We'll be routing those transactions in a way that makes the most sense for that financial institution. So we're very, very bullish about that activity because not only are we bringing the real-time capability to bear, but we've got the actual application : Popmoney, bill payment, TransferNow, all kinds of different products that consumers are able to very simply and easily initiate that payment transaction. And we aspire to have us an experience, where it's really about the consumer making the choice of speed and not needing to do anything else and right through their financial institution. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, got it. One quick follow-up for me. You mentioned the bill pay performance at your largest client was still a bit softer than expected. I mean can you comment a bit on your expectations for maybe kind of turning that around? Are there any potential catalysts or any kind of mitigating factors or techniques that you can apply to kind of get that business moving in the direction you sort of expected? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, there are. We've got a couple of issues going on in that client. You have that client, in some cases, shedding branches and shedding accounts, and so it's difficult to do anything around that. So you've got a little bit of an organic loss that you have to deal with. But that client is very good at deciding it's going to push on bill payment and really extend bill payment into their base. And we believe we'll have some opportunities to do that later on this year, and we would expect that, that will be another one of those tailwinds that will help push our growth rate up as we move through '14 and into '15. Well, that's great. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. If you have any questions or follow-ups, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of www.fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. Please note that due to the timing of our Spring Client Conference, we will release our first quarter's earnings a bit later than usual. And also, we are pleased to announce that we will hold our Investor Day on June 16 in New York City. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share. We are pleased with our accomplishments for the year. We enter 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate. However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year. At the outset of 2014, we communicated 3 key priorities to help you gauge our progress for the year : first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually, and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end of our full year internal revenue growth guidance.  Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter, and for the full year also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 50 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high-quality revenue growth. Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well-defined capital allocation strategy with strong cash flow generation resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year. To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. On that front, we closed 7 DNA sales in the quarter, 26 for the full year, and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real-time, straight-through processing, modern architecture and have a desire to look -- to deliver new value in a data-centric world. Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014, and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. In addition, integrated sales for Open Solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates, with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition. We continued to ride the digital wave, adding nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users, and importantly, grew the Mobiliti ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly 3 million subscribers. We also went live with our Mobiliti Business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile-enabled commercial capabilities. Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions were strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012, and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year.  We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network. We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example, Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution, renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment capabilities, signing a 7-year extension for       CheckFree RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow, along with the small business versions of each of these services. Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. NOW, or the Network for Our World, is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed of the user's choice. We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers. We recently extended our bill payment, account-to-account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as they provide their customers with a differentiated payment experience based on several factors, including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility. We're excited about the extension of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than 55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year. Real-time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around the world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation. We are proud to have been selected by SWIFT to help build the infrastructure of the new payments platform, or NPP, for Australia. This is an expansive project whereby SWIFT and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure to the country. This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities. We're also seeing strong interest in Agiliti, our new cloud-based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand is high and stretches across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated. We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015, as our first clients go live late this year. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6% and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, along with our continued focus on operational efficiency. We are particularly pleased with our Payments segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year. Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment was strong across the majority of the businesses, including card solutions, channels, bill payment and Output Solutions. As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag on our revenue growth this year, which we'll annualize in the first half of 2015. Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above-market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales. We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year. We remain focused on enabling our clients to be at the forefront of the dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful new revenue over the next several years. Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance, increasing 120 basis points to 32.1%. And for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%. Growth in high-quality Payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to $610 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses, including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points to the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially. The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 factors. First, our results were compared to record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation. And finally, we experienced 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations due to several factors including revenue mix and investments in our new Agiliti solution. For the full year, adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million, and segment margin was flat at 32.6%. Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal costs along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system. Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year. Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior-year periods, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately 100 basis points to 35% in 2015, which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact on adjusted EPS for this year. We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate. We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress in effectively and profitably monetizing the businesses through disposition. As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains, is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year. We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially. We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. This strong result is even more impressive when considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013. Our focus on high-quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continues to produce excellent free cash flow per share results. Total debt at year-end was $3.8 billion, or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year, we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing 18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share. We announced a new 20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter, and at year end, had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter, and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channel, lending and account processing led the way to our record 2014 performance. Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue. We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients have maintained a keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, Mobiliti and Source Capture. As I mentioned upfront, results within the Open Solutions client base are very strong, nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $70 million in 2014, or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings this year were driven by strong procurement results and Open Solutions synergies. We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. The banking sector firmed during the year. With only 7 regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last 2 years. M&A activity picked up during the year and we expect that trend to continue. We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend to 2015. Financial institutions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency. Payments are getting the majority of the industry ink right now, with areas such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real-time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion. We are well suited to partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena. With that, let's move to 2015. In addition to financial guidance, we have defined 3 key enterprise priorities for the year : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. Now let's move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin, and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share. We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth rate this year considers a number of performance scenarios including, among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation. We also expect our growth rate to bias to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expected ramp of new revenue throughout the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14%, or a range of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that our focus on the combination of high-quality revenue and Operational Effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points. We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12, following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and an expected 3-year compound growth in free cash flow per share of 14%. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million and our integrated sales target is $250 million. Lastly, although we don't give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparison for the year, given the lower tax rate in 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was, by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year. In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned to bolster our adjusted internal revenue growth rate again for this year, expand operating margin, and deliver value for you, our shareholders, through strong cash flow generation and capital allocation. Lastly, let me thank the more than 21,000 associates who focus their collective energy on delivering value for clients each and every day. They truly are Fiserv's most important asset. And with that, Tony, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I was wondering if you can maybe start on the DNA wins. I believe you said there was 15 customers that converted in 2014. And just to clarify, are you expecting 30 more to convert to revenue in 2015? And maybe you could possibly size revenue contribution of those conversions. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Jim, you got those numbers right. So we have -- 15 went live in '14, and we expect that to a little bit more than double in 2015. And we wouldn't be able to size it right now, but clearly, that gives us momentum going into '15. And also, keep in mind that those conversions will happen on a ratable basis, not perfectly ratable, but a ratable basis throughout the year. And so even the clients that go live in the -- in midyear won't even anniversary until 2016. So we expect that momentum to continue into the future. Thomas Hirsch : And I think, just to add to what Jeff said there, Jim, is the add on, the Payments revenue, et cetera, is going to continue to come on as those implementations continue. So that growth will be a nice tailwind over the next several years. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up, maybe you could just comment on the -- I think the Fed released the payment monetization road map last week. Can you maybe talk about the opportunity that you have for real-time payments, Popmoney or other real-time transfers, as you go to the next few years? Do you think that banks are going to be more willing to accelerate their investments in these areas? Or do you think maybe that actually makes them take a bit of a more of a wait-and-see approach on those investments? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, my take on that, Jim, is all the discussion around real time is quite positive in terms of banks thinking about how can we systemically allow those 55 billion payments that don't occur at point of sale to move faster than they do today. I think most everyone would say that over -- it's going to be a number of years until that road map is -- actually comes together, and however it ultimately gets settled that it allows, in a single way for that -- for the real-time systemic movement to occur. And so from our standpoint, we're having lots and lots of conversations with institutions who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities to drive high-quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability. So from our perspective, we see it to be positive. Ultimately, we do think that -- that real-time changes the nature of how bill payment, and P2P specifically, work today, and that will be important transaction drivers over the next 3 to 5, 7 years. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Rayna Kumar : This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut.  Are you seeing DNA gaining share specifically from Symitar in the large credit union space? Jeffery Yabuki : Rayna, what we're really seeing is that institutions who are really looking for opportunities to modernize their infrastructure, to use data in a way that is different than historically has happened in the account processing or in the core processing engines, are looking at this technology as an opportunity. We see that happening in the bank space as well as in the credit union space. Rayna Kumar : Got it. Can you quantify your expected operating margin expansion between the Payments and Financial segment for 2015 and just talk a little bit about the drivers? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we -- one of the things that we don't do is we don't give segment or margin -- segment margin guidance. And the reason why we don't do it is we're going to see different -- at different times and in different places, we're going to have opportunities to invest. We're going to see different performance across business lines. You're going to have changes in comparability and lots of different factors that will have an impact, will create variability within the segments. And from our standpoint, we're really operating the company to deliver at least 50 basis points of margin at the company level, and that will come from a combination of new growth and existing changes and existing revenue scale, Operational Effectiveness, and the like. So from our perspective, it's hard to sit here right now and say that we will have room in one segment or another. We do have a high degree of confidence that we'll see margins grow for -- and certainly in 2015, by at least 50 basis points is the guidance that we talked about as well as our longer-term outlook. Thomas Hirsch : And I would just give a little bit more clarity there, a little bit detail around the segments. On the Payments side, clearly, we had a very strong year and we're operating at good scale and a lot of those operations continue to grow those very well. Financial was, as you well know, was flat on a year-over-year basis. We clearly had a few things going on there. We really had some difficult international comparisons. We're also investing, as Jeff highlighted, in our Agiliti platform during the year. We've also ramped up a lot of resources in our DNA business around implementation and development. And we also had a couple of small product line consolidations. So we have expanded margins in that segment about 200 basis points over the last 3 years. And we're confident as we look into the future, we're going to continue to expand margins in that segment. But as Jeff indicated, you're going to have different puts and takes in these segments as we go through future years also. Rayna Kumar : Got it. That's very helpful. Can you just talk a little about the size of your M&A pipeline and the businesses you're interested in acquiring? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, we wouldn't make any comments about the specifics of the pipeline. But I will say that we're focused on looking in areas to deploy capital from an acquisition perspective where we can increase the level of competitive differentiation in businesses where we have scale positions and we have opportunities. And we have an interest in the payments and channels area because we think that's an important area for clients and we think they're important growth drivers moving forward.  Of course, anything that we do from an acquisition perspective, we're always going to tie it back to our trade-offs against share repurchase. But there's obviously a lot of activity in the market and we're active in looking at that activity. We're active at looking at what's out there just to make sure we understand what's going on in the market at any point in time. Rayna Kumar : Okay, one quick final question for me. If you can just quantify the term fees in the fourth quarter and compare that to the term fees from the year ago quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, they were about flat compared to the prior year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Koning of Baird. David Koning : Yes. So just on the Payments segment, great acceleration through the year. In the context even of the bill pay transactions and debit transactions decelerating just a touch, is that due to a mix shift towards a little, like, maybe smaller bank transactions that yield higher? Maybe you can kind of just give us a little context why revenue accelerated while those had a little bit of deceleration. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. I think overall from a revenue standpoint, we've had some very good growth in payments really across the board. When you look at our channels, our bill payment, which had a lot of new wins, and our Output Solutions -- and we just really had a great year there, we're building a lot of recurring revenue. And our debit processing business continues to perform really exceptionally from a standpoint of growth. And I think our fourth quarter transaction growth in debit, David, was actually a little bit higher than the other quarters at 12% and the full year was 11%. So combination of new wins, a lot of integrated sales activities, along with DNA, et cetera, and those wins is helping that offering that we have with our integrated bill payment and debit, et cetera. So we have good momentum there. We have a little headwind in the current year in our biller business that's going to extend to the first half of next year. But outside of that, we have overall good momentum. Jeffery Yabuki : And the other thing I would say, Dave, is we're also -- have had some level of success in adding revenue in our, specifically in our bill payment business, which is not purely transactionally-based anymore. So we're changing that mix a little bit. And the other thing that's happened over the last, call it, the last 3, 4, 5 years is the bill payment business itself has become a smaller and smaller part of the Payments segment. So yes, the businesses are growing, but if you think back to the CheckFree days, obviously, the bill payment business was everything. It's become a lesser element of the segment. So the correlation to transaction growth isn't as pure as it once was. David Koning : Got you. Okay. And just -- I guess my follow-up, when you're guiding to 5% to 6% internal growth, that's a reported number, I'm assuming. I'm just wondering what FX headwind is kind of built in there? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we -- it is a reported number. We don't report on a constant-currency basis. So we've assumed that there will be negative input from currency. We have a variety of different scenarios in which we've worked into our analysis. It's one of the reasons why the range is a bit wider this year than when we entered 2014. So we expect currency to be down. I don't think any of us have a perfect crystal ball on where it's going to land, but we do expect it to weigh us down. But it is incorporated into our guidance for the year. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. And I think, Dave, the impact that we highlighted on the call was about 40 basis points in the quarter, about 20 basis points for the year. So we expect '15 to be greater than that clearly, but as Jeff indicated, we've incorporated the range into our broader guidance. So it's going to be a bigger headwind than what we had in '14. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I have a couple of questions on EMV. You mentioned you thought the timing of EMV adoption is kind of the key variable revenue driver in 2015. It kind of seems like a split is developing between the large banks that are reissuing their card portfolios. Small banks, maybe your customers, are kind of -- seem to be putting it off. I guess, a, is it a fair characterization? And, b, does it imply that at some point, you get a real kind of true-up and sort of more rapid migration in your base than is occurring now? Mark Ernst : Hey, Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that. The split that we see primarily is, first and foremost, between credit and debit. So what you've heard principally from the larger banks are those banks have a large credit portfolio and they are reissuing early around credit. And that's really because of some technical -- the technical issues which I think you're familiar with around kind of clarifying the Durbin rules as it relates to debit. The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycles started with debit. We think that, that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015. Indications that we can see out of our client base would say that they are kind of behaving or expecting to reissue in much the way that I think the larger banks have indicated they are on debit as well. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. I think the other thing to consider is that, within our business, we have -- we do card production for our debit clients and we also do card production for a broad range of clients who are not within our debit processing footprint. So we have a broader range of clients and we serve only in the debit processing business. But clearly it's -- again, one of the reasons why our range is larger this year is we don't have a perfect estimate of how that's going to lay in. We think it's an important opportunity that'll benefit Fiserv for the next several years. And so, obviously, we'll know more as we progress over 2015, but we feel good about that opportunity overall. Ramsey El-Assal: And just a quick follow-up on that -- the EMV kind of topic. How do we -- so you gave just a little color now in terms of quantifying the size of that opportunity. I mean, do you handle pretty much all the card printing for your bank customers? I understand now you have new customers outside just the bank footprint, but is this something where we can say there's a price of an EMV card and we're multiplying it by effectively every debit card issued in the Fiserv family of customers? Or is it more nuanced, than that, there's an outsourcing, there's some puts and takes or... Mark Ernst : Yes, again, it's a bit more nuanced than that. I mean, in general, yes, we know all those numbers and we can kind of model different scenarios. But the other kind of wild card in all this is to what degree some institutions will choose to stay with mag stripe only as a cost matter and accept the fraud risk once the conversion date occurs. So there's a number of kind of puts and takes in there, and I think different institutions are looking at risk in different ways. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And Ramsey, I would say one of the key topics that we'll discuss at our June Investor Day is in fact EMV and how we see -- how our model will take that in and what are the kind of the factors that will be considered as this comes in over the next several years. And clearly, it's important, and that's why we're going to give it some time in June. Mark Ernst : And by June, we'll have much more clarity, or more clarity, certainly. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Christopher Shutler : So first on Open Solutions. Can you just give us a quick update on the -- I think you've initially laid out $100 million and $60 million of revenue cost synergy targets and just how you're progressing against those? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. We're -- as I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to feel very good about the level of revenue synergies in the Open business. We, in the middle of last year -- or in the middle of '13 now, we indicated that we were moving our estimates up, because in fact the receptiveness of the Open Solutions base to taking the integrated products that we provide had been quite strong, and that continued. We had roughly 20-ish million of sales within that grouping in 13 and another 40 in 15, of which that, obviously, much of that has not come on yet. It'll come on over time, and so we see some benefits from that, and we'll continue to see opportunities within that base. We typically see in an acquisition that it takes 2 to 3 years to get our stride from a revenue synergy perspective. So we began to see it in the second half of last year, and we think that will continue throughout this year and early into '16. And we're also seeing some very nice opportunities from the Open Solutions product set, moving that back into the Fiserv client base as well. So very good movement on that front. And then, on the cost synergy side, we indicated again this year that a lot of the value that we drove in the Operational Effectiveness category came from Open Solutions. So again, we feel very good about that and are, in that case -- in both cases, actually, well on track if not ahead of where we anticipated we would be. Christopher Shutler : All right, great. And then, Jeff, I think you said that you had 14 million mobile users versus -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think you have around 70 million online banking users. At least, that's the latest number I have. Just curious how you're trying to increase adoption amongst the users given that it's a bit of a new skill set for Fiserv, not just -- not working just with the FIs, but also consumers. And to what extent you're banking on, I guess, revenue growth in the Payments segment over the next several years being driven by your success increasing mobile adoption? Jeffery Yabuki : I have to say this. Banking, no pun intended, right? Christopher Shutler : Exactly, Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : All right. Sorry. It's a great question. It is, again, one of the topics that we're going to cover in some level of depth at Investor Day, but I would say that we do see a lot of growth in terms of the opportunity to take mobile up to a large degree against that 70 million. Now in fairness, we don't believe we'll get all 70 million because some of those 70 million are on -- on the larger Corillian platform and some of that have -- some of those institutions have adopted Mobiliti, some of them have not. But we do see a much larger opportunity to grow specifically the ASP subscriber base, which we said we're near 3 million this year. That number is still at a very low level of penetration and we expect to see meaningful growth. We actually introduced a new program late in 2014 where we're working with our bank and credit union clients to help them drive better adoption in their client base. I mean, the beauty of mobile is that consumers want it and the financial institutions want consumers to use it. And so they're really looking for ways to drive that together. So we have very strong alignment. We see that to be a very big opportunity and you will continue to hear us talk about it, and we would expect that, over time, that'll continue to accelerate for us and drive some nice recurring revenue. Mark Ernst : The other thing I was going to add to that is to your point about this being a new skill set to some degree for Fiserv. One of the benefits that we have is given the broad range of financial institutions that are using some of these solutions, we now have the opportunity to look across that base of institutions and find those who are performing better versus others and understand and benchmark what they're doing and bring those best practices out to our other clients. That is proving to be very successful for us so far as we help our clients figure out how to better engage their customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Condra of BMO Capital Markets. Paul Condra : I wanted to ask a little bit about the NOW Network that you've been speaking about a bit now. But I wondered if we can get a little bit more detail just about what kind of new functionality it's going to have. Or who are going to be the kind of first users, the initial end users? And then, maybe provide us some detail about how that rolls on. What's the expected revenue impact? How should we be thinking about it? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Paul. I mean, the -- at a headline level, I mean, the purpose of the network is to create opportunities to have more data connected to the payments beyond point of sale. This is really to focus on the 55 billion payments that happen through the non-POS side of the system. And so we're looking at how do we use data, how do we use speed, how do we integrate those capabilities into applications such as bill payment and Popmoney to allow, we think, the important convenience aspect of these -- of electronifying in a much faster way these payments. So we would see this coming in over the next 3 to 5 years. An important element of this infrastructure is creating more electronification. Obviously, paper payments are only going to move at a certain pace. So one of the things that we are looking at is how do we create a faster and faster electronification. That's one of the aspects as well. We do see this to be an important revenue opportunity, again, over time, as we've seen institutions today be able to create differentiated pricing around this. And we think that's one of the areas that institutions will use to drive new value. I would say, on the call, that's probably about as much detail as we can go into, but we will talk about this in more depth in June. Paul Condra : As a follow-up, it sounds like you didn't raise your integrated sales target. And I'm just wondering if there's any shift in strategy there. Or how did you get to that number? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we didn't raise it in terms of where we performed this year versus last year. But we do think that the $250 million is an appropriate level. We were $250 million in 2014. We delivered $260 million. Obviously, we're always looking to deliver as much as we can, and we think it's appropriate at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Darrin Peller : Can you just provide a bit more color on the financial margin in the quarter and just the moving parts during 2015? I think -- I know you mentioned earlier the variable comp levels, and I think you said it was relative to last year's margin level. Maybe just, Tom, if you can give a little more explanation of what the driver was between last year's and this year's. And then, going forward, it's good to see once again another year of 50 basis points plus a margin expansion for '15. Is that -- what -- is that a function of mix and scale, or are there any cost initiatives? Can you give us a little color on the driving force? Thomas Hirsch : Okay, Darrin. I'll start with that one. And in the Q4 quarter, we had a couple of things. One is particularly in the Financial segment. First and foremost, if you look back at our margin in the fourth quarter last year, that's the highest margin I believe we've had ever in that segment, which was a very strong comparison to this quarter. The second thing is we had timing associated with some variable comp, both incentives and commissions. We had a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expensed commissions and we also had some ACEP, which is some variable comp, which we had to expense in the current quarter. And then, the other piece -- that was about 100 basis points. And then, the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix. It had a very difficult comparison. Also, we've had this during the year and it also accentuated in the fourth quarter. And then, we had some increased spending in our Agiliti platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlighted on the call, our margins in that segment over the past 3 years are up about 200 basis points. Clearly, as we look forward, and you indicated, where's the margin drivers going to happen? We are, clearly, from the Payments segment standpoint, at a good place. We're executing very well there, continue to drive incremental revenue on our recurring base solutions like card and bill payment and all the rest. Regarding financial, we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly, DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we're going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015. And so that scale is starting to return there as we've had to put more into development and implementation. And so we're confident overall, along with our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. We are -- have a number of those we're going to be executing in '15 that will benefit us in '16 and forward. So those things leave us much comfort that we're very confident that we're going to have margin expansion greater than 50 in 2015. Darrin Peller : Okay, that's great. I was just going to say -- I mean, when you compare to 2014 with all the investments you made in DNA, now that you're actually rolling on the vast majority of these clients, I would think there could be even better than 50 basis points now. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I mean, we're giving guidance at greater than 50 and we're highly confident that we're going to continue be able to expand margins through our high -- our focus on high -- Darrin Peller : That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up. I mean, Financials, like you said before, I mean, it was flat growth in '13 and it accelerated to 2% in '14. I know you're not really giving segment-level guidance. But these drivers, whether it's DNA or some of the larger clients, I mean, should we expect at some point that, that growth rate should continue to accelerate? Or is that a sort of a low single-digit growth while Payments really drives the engine for your overall top line? Thomas Hirsch : I think we're going to continue to have -- our Payments segment is going to be higher than our Financial segment clearly over time, just given the nature of the businesses that are in each segment. I do think, over the longer term, Financial segment should continue as we continue to expand our international, and to your point, continue to get a lot of revenue from DNA and other strong market share wins that we've had in the account processing space. So I think -- remember, the international stuff does fall into our Financial segment. And over the next few years, we continue to believe we're going to be growing there, and then clearly with the DNA implementations coming on in '15, that's going to also provide an accelerator. Darrin Peller : Okay, just a last question and I'll return to the queue. But on the free cash flow per share growth, you guys have always done a great job of not only generating a lot of free cash flow but returning it through buybacks, and guidance now suggests that continues. The only question I have is just the free cash flow per share guidance. I think you called for $4.12, if I remember correctly? Thomas Hirsch : At least $4.12. Darrin Peller : All right. Well, I guess what I'm wondering is why that's in sort of a high single-digit growth rate when you're calling for 11% to 14% EPS growth. And I think you mentioned earlier some moving parts on working capital, but any more color on that would be great. Thomas Hirsch : Okay. Yes, I think we had -- we significantly outperformed in the current year at $3.82 versus our greater than 3.60 -- $3.65 per share guidance. So when we looked at that, we did have some working capital that benefited us this year and some of that is going to reverse as we go forward into '15. But overall, Darrin, our compounded annual growth rate of free cash flow per share including '15, '14 and '13 is roughly 14% on a CAGR basis at the $4.12 level. And as you know, our guidance is greater than $4.12. So again, I think you're going to have some fluctuation in working capital, but we've really from a -- just from a free cash flow per share standpoint, we've had really some strong results. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan Securities. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Just a couple of follow-ups. Everything is pretty clean here. Just on the guidance, the revenue guidance, what it's going to take to get to the 6% adjusted revenue growth? You have some large deals that you see or maybe that could ramp to get you there. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, as you know, Tien-tsin, I mean, for us, it's difficult to do, to get large deals in here that make a big enough difference that we can have a meaningful impact. The big drivers for us are areas like EMV where we think there's a broad range of scenarios that we could see, depending on what happens in a market, what goes on with currency trends. And frankly, to get to the upper end, you'd have to have many more things go right than would not. I mean, we feel good about the range. And again, there are some things going on as we talked about that are a little bit different in '15 than we saw in '14. But we feel quite confident about where we sit today. And it won't be really sales-based, it'll be what goes on in kind of in the market -- or I'm sorry, what goes on within our client base currently. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood, understood. And then, just on FX. I heard those comments of 40 bps in the fourth quarter, but obviously the dollar strengthened quite a bit. Could it be as much of it -- as much of a -- could it round up to a 1% hit if current rates hold? Just trying to get a sense of where we stand today. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, as you know, our revenue is, call it, 6%, 7% outside. So I mean, we'd have to see, I think, some pretty negative things to have it be at that level, but we don't have a crystal ball. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, yes. I hate to be rounding basis points here but I figured I'd ask. Just one last follow-up if you don't mind for you, Jeff, just on tokenization. We've been doing a lot of research there. Can you just educate us on Fiserv's role or future role in a tokenized world? Are you aiming to be a token wallet provider? And there's a lot of definitions around token service providers, so what is Fiserv's role? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So I mean, I think at this stage, we are looking to play the most important partnering role we can with our clients. I'm sure you know, as well as I do, if not better, that there's lots of evolution going on with kind of the token control, in quotes, right now. So I mean, we do see opportunities there. And we actually see opportunities to think about tokenization even more broadly than just on the card side. So when you think about some of this 50 kind of -- how do you move with more speed and alacrity for the 55 billion payments that are outside of point of sale? We see some opportunities there as well. So I think it's an evolving topic right now. We are having lots and lots of conversations that would say that our clients would like to see us play an important role there. And so we're looking for what's the -- what -- how can we work with the existing provider space to make sure that we're doing the best thing we can for our clients and also driving as much value as possible on the shareholder side. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Brett Huff : One sort of big picture question. It was kind of hinted at in the last one. If you guys look out sort of 3 years, whatever your sort of medium-term horizon planning period is, what is the thing that, if you could spend more on, you'd really pour some gas on the fire because you think there's something there? I mean, like, I was thinking like Popmoney, maybe in Payments, I'm not sure what the equivalent is in the Financial segment. But what is that thing where you think the investment would be -- it's big enough that you really think you'd want to do more, if you could? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say this entire space outside of point of sale, these 55 billion payments, which includes everything from person-to-person to account-to-account to business-to-business, small business-to-consumer, consumer-to-small business, I mean, that space I really think about as the last horizon of payments. And the opportunity for us to work with financial institutions to ensure that non-FIs don't come in and take over that space. I mean, it's, as you know, it's a highly competitive world out there and there are lots and lots of providers trying to scrape away pieces of that value chain. So we're looking to both protect that value chain but more importantly protect it by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in a non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on. And I think the other big opportunity out there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we're going to see, over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made, so new -- basically through new products. So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then, thinking about how can you use the data to enhance those kinds of decisions, both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side. So I think those are 2 areas that are at least quite interesting to us as we think about where the world will go over time. And clearly, we are investing in those kinds of areas, but we're not doing it in an unconstrained way. We're doing it in a responsible way so we can continue to drive high-quality revenue to make sure that we can meet our margin commitments at the same time. Brett Huff : That makes sense. And as a follow-up, on bill pay, you mentioned that you're -- it sounds like the business model may be evolving a little bit. It's not as purely tied to a per-tran basis maybe. Is there a -- first of all, I want to make sure I understand that right. And second of all, is there a world in which bill pay stops being as a per-tran revenue and becomes more, I don't know, not all-inclusive or whatever, but more bundled, or even a license arrangement? I mean, is that a foreseeable outcome? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So Brett, I would say that we do see a variety of different ways in which we are driving value in the -- on the bill payment -- in the bill payment business. Some of it has to do with services, customization, so the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. I mean, one of the things that we talked about is that spend -- spend focus is really big time around customer experience. And as you know well, the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want is certainly one of the opportunities out there. And so we've had an opportunity to create some additional streams of revenue in that space. You've got some add-on transactional opportunities, whether it's around risk management, e-bill, those kinds of things. And then, there's another emerging category which really ties into this whole notion of systematic real-time, and that is premium transaction. So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end, so whether they be bill payment, P2P, or account-to-account transfer, linking that to real-time and then charging consumers a reasonable fee that they can -- so that they'll avail themselves of that real-time capability when it makes sense for their own situation. So you add all those up, and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently. And I think we've talked about the fact that there may be some point where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more, quote, premium or faster transactions. And so we are looking at different pricing models and different ways to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financial institutions and what we need. But I will say -- the only thing I would say is I don't see us moving to a license kind of a model. I see this continuing to be a cloud-based, an ASP solution, because there's a network effect that's very important. And we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving real-time transaction. So it is an evolving space for us. I'm quite excited about this evolution and believe that we are extremely well positioned to lead that over the next 3, 5, 7 years. Brett Huff : That's really helpful. And then, just last quick one. Did you guys talk at all about the tenor of what you think the deployment of the repo authorization might be this year? Jeffery Yabuki : Kind of how -- we did not give any guidance to how we'll move through the remaining shares. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : A couple of quick questions. Just first on the sales growth, another good year, the 12% year-over-year. Maybe Jeff, at a high level, the 2 or 3 key drivers of that? And then, also just to clarify, are the Open Solutions sales results included in that? Or is that sort of a separate metric? And then, what directionally would be the increase in the quota for '15? Jeffery Yabuki : So I would say, Glenn, that the easy answer is Open -- the Open Solutions -- the old Open Solutions business is included in there. And it was included in the -- on an actual basis. It was included in the prior year as well. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison. I mean, the big drivers in the sales results for the year are going to be around our account processing platforms. We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014 in terms of DNA, but also around Premier, Signature, Precision, Cleartouch. I mean, so we've had good success because the beauty of our product set is that we don't think there's a one-size-fits-all. We know that different institutions want different solutions. So the account processing business did well. Our lending business had a very good year, very happy with the work there. Our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well. And in fact, everyone had a good year. Card solution did very well. We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payment results were the highest that we've had since 2012. So really across the board. And I think it's -- it is a matter of having products that are appealing to clients on the account processing side where we have a good, strong, integrated value proposition because we're delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks. So that's worked out well and we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly, we don't -- we wouldn't talk about the numbers and quota, but I will say I think this is our third year in a row that we would say we've had record sales. And we're continuing to be in a place where we expect on the basis of the investments that we make, to continue to be able to drive increased sales. Part of that comes from being better with our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our Mobiliti for business which is our commercial -- our mobile -- I'm sorry, our commercial mobile solution. And that we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institutions over the next several years. So again, it's a combination of continuing to have the best sales force and also introducing new products. Glenn Greene : Okay. And for Tom, on the FX, Jeff, I think mentioned that international is 6% to 7% of revenue. Is that roughly evenly split between euro and the Aussie dollar, just so we can sort of like do our own modeling and think about it? Thomas Hirsch : I don't know if that's evenly split, and I can get back to you offline on that, Glenn. I think it's probably a combination of both and a few others, smaller ones. So that's how I would put that. And I'd say we're, as I highlighted, 40 basis points in the quarter, 20 basis points for the year, and we expect that to be bigger in '15 from a headwind standpoint. Glenn Greene : And then just real quick on the decrease in the year-over-year corporate costs, I thought I heard you say about lower incentive comp which I didn't really fully understand why that would be. Thomas Hirsch : No, no. Not on the -- I said lower consulting and legal costs and -- than in the prior year where we had an implementation of a new HR system which we had a lot of expense associated with. Operator : Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, you talked about gaining market share on the bill payment side. I'm wondering is the competitive environment changing? Or what are the drivers for you to be able to gain that market share? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I think what we said is we had our strongest sales quarter in the fourth quarter since 2012 and we had somewhere north of 300 wins for the year, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen going for the last several years. I would say it's twofold. It is, first and foremost, having what we believe is the best solution in the market, and that's especially important as speed becomes more and more important to consumers. So the ability to link up the, certainly, the, again, what we think is the best product in the market with some of our solutions such as PEP+ which are going to help today enable real-time. I think that's a big opportunity and a big differentiator. And then, secondly, the continuing ability to deliver that into our account processing base which, as you know, is somewhere in the area of 5,000 financial institutions. So it's really the combination of those 2 that's creating the success. Kartik Mehta : And then, just a question, Jeff, on -- or maybe a business that's been forgotten or not talked about with the check processing business. And as you see checks decline, are there opportunities for you out there in your client base, or outside your client base, to win that business and potentially help the check processing business as these banks come under pressure as their volumes are declining? Jeffery Yabuki : The theoretic answer is yes. I mean, I would say that, over time, there had been several different junctures where we believed that given the financial pressures, that there would be more motivation to outsource that solution. And today, we've had discussions but we frankly haven't seen a lot of movement in that space. And I'm sure there are a variety of reasons why. But for now, we certainly aren't counting on that happening when we think about forward revenue growth. If it happens, that's great. But it's certainly not part -- it's not an important part of our growth formula moving forward. Kartik Mehta : And then, Jeff, just a last question. Any benefits or hurdles from the regulatory environment that could help you grow revenue or win additional market share from others? Jeffery Yabuki : I mean, I think there is a general \"benefit\" in the market because of the level of regulatory scrutiny and pressure, which is causing institutions to take a good look at how they spend and are they getting the most -- are they getting the optimal value for that spend. I would say that's a more systemic benefit and that the providers themselves are generally equal on that front. Mark Ernst : There probably are a few of our product lines that are disproportionately benefiting from the regulatory pressure. We talked about the opportunity in lending, which has a strong kind of regulatory undercurrent to the changes that we've seen in that market. Jeffery Yabuki : Absolutely. Thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. I know we went a little bit longer than we typically do, but we appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's call.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of www.fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. Please note that due to the timing of our Spring Client Conference, we will release our first quarter's earnings a bit later than usual. And also, we are pleased to announce that we will hold our Investor Day on June 16 in New York City. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share. We are pleased with our accomplishments for the year. We enter 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate. However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year. At the outset of 2014, we communicated 3 key priorities to help you gauge our progress for the year : first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually, and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end of our full year internal revenue growth guidance.  Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter, and for the full year also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 50 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high-quality revenue growth. Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well-defined capital allocation strategy with strong cash flow generation resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year. To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. On that front, we closed 7 DNA sales in the quarter, 26 for the full year, and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real-time, straight-through processing, modern architecture and have a desire to look -- to deliver new value in a data-centric world. Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014, and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. In addition, integrated sales for Open Solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates, with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition. We continued to ride the digital wave, adding nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users, and importantly, grew the Mobiliti ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly 3 million subscribers. We also went live with our Mobiliti Business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile-enabled commercial capabilities. Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions were strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012, and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year.  We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network. We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example, Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution, renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment capabilities, signing a 7-year extension for       CheckFree RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow, along with the small business versions of each of these services. Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. NOW, or the Network for Our World, is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed of the user's choice. We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers. We recently extended our bill payment, account-to-account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as they provide their customers with a differentiated payment experience based on several factors, including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility. We're excited about the extension of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than 55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year. Real-time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around the world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation. We are proud to have been selected by SWIFT to help build the infrastructure of the new payments platform, or NPP, for Australia. This is an expansive project whereby SWIFT and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure to the country. This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities. We're also seeing strong interest in Agiliti, our new cloud-based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand is high and stretches across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated. We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015, as our first clients go live late this year. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6% and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, along with our continued focus on operational efficiency. We are particularly pleased with our Payments segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year. Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment was strong across the majority of the businesses, including card solutions, channels, bill payment and Output Solutions. As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag on our revenue growth this year, which we'll annualize in the first half of 2015. Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above-market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales. We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year. We remain focused on enabling our clients to be at the forefront of the dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful new revenue over the next several years. Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance, increasing 120 basis points to 32.1%. And for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%. Growth in high-quality Payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to $610 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses, including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points to the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially. The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 factors. First, our results were compared to record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation. And finally, we experienced 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations due to several factors including revenue mix and investments in our new Agiliti solution. For the full year, adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million, and segment margin was flat at 32.6%. Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal costs along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system. Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year. Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior-year periods, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately 100 basis points to 35% in 2015, which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact on adjusted EPS for this year. We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate. We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress in effectively and profitably monetizing the businesses through disposition. As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains, is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year. We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially. We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. This strong result is even more impressive when considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013. Our focus on high-quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continues to produce excellent free cash flow per share results. Total debt at year-end was $3.8 billion, or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year, we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing 18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share. We announced a new 20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter, and at year end, had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter, and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channel, lending and account processing led the way to our record 2014 performance. Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue. We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients have maintained a keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, Mobiliti and Source Capture. As I mentioned upfront, results within the Open Solutions client base are very strong, nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $70 million in 2014, or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings this year were driven by strong procurement results and Open Solutions synergies. We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. The banking sector firmed during the year. With only 7 regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last 2 years. M&A activity picked up during the year and we expect that trend to continue. We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend to 2015. Financial institutions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency. Payments are getting the majority of the industry ink right now, with areas such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real-time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion. We are well suited to partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena. With that, let's move to 2015. In addition to financial guidance, we have defined 3 key enterprise priorities for the year : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. Now let's move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin, and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share. We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth rate this year considers a number of performance scenarios including, among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation. We also expect our growth rate to bias to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expected ramp of new revenue throughout the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14%, or a range of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that our focus on the combination of high-quality revenue and Operational Effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points. We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12, following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and an expected 3-year compound growth in free cash flow per share of 14%. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million and our integrated sales target is $250 million. Lastly, although we don't give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparison for the year, given the lower tax rate in 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was, by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year. In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned to bolster our adjusted internal revenue growth rate again for this year, expand operating margin, and deliver value for you, our shareholders, through strong cash flow generation and capital allocation. Lastly, let me thank the more than 21,000 associates who focus their collective energy on delivering value for clients each and every day. They truly are Fiserv's most important asset. And with that, Tony, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I was wondering if you can maybe start on the DNA wins. I believe you said there was 15 customers that converted in 2014. And just to clarify, are you expecting 30 more to convert to revenue in 2015? And maybe you could possibly size revenue contribution of those conversions. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Jim, you got those numbers right. So we have -- 15 went live in '14, and we expect that to a little bit more than double in 2015. And we wouldn't be able to size it right now, but clearly, that gives us momentum going into '15. And also, keep in mind that those conversions will happen on a ratable basis, not perfectly ratable, but a ratable basis throughout the year. And so even the clients that go live in the -- in midyear won't even anniversary until 2016. So we expect that momentum to continue into the future. Thomas Hirsch : And I think, just to add to what Jeff said there, Jim, is the add on, the Payments revenue, et cetera, is going to continue to come on as those implementations continue. So that growth will be a nice tailwind over the next several years. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up, maybe you could just comment on the -- I think the Fed released the payment monetization road map last week. Can you maybe talk about the opportunity that you have for real-time payments, Popmoney or other real-time transfers, as you go to the next few years? Do you think that banks are going to be more willing to accelerate their investments in these areas? Or do you think maybe that actually makes them take a bit of a more of a wait-and-see approach on those investments? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, my take on that, Jim, is all the discussion around real time is quite positive in terms of banks thinking about how can we systemically allow those 55 billion payments that don't occur at point of sale to move faster than they do today. I think most everyone would say that over -- it's going to be a number of years until that road map is -- actually comes together, and however it ultimately gets settled that it allows, in a single way for that -- for the real-time systemic movement to occur. And so from our standpoint, we're having lots and lots of conversations with institutions who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities to drive high-quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability. So from our perspective, we see it to be positive. Ultimately, we do think that -- that real-time changes the nature of how bill payment, and P2P specifically, work today, and that will be important transaction drivers over the next 3 to 5, 7 years. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Rayna Kumar : This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut.  Are you seeing DNA gaining share specifically from Symitar in the large credit union space? Jeffery Yabuki : Rayna, what we're really seeing is that institutions who are really looking for opportunities to modernize their infrastructure, to use data in a way that is different than historically has happened in the account processing or in the core processing engines, are looking at this technology as an opportunity. We see that happening in the bank space as well as in the credit union space. Rayna Kumar : Got it. Can you quantify your expected operating margin expansion between the Payments and Financial segment for 2015 and just talk a little bit about the drivers? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we -- one of the things that we don't do is we don't give segment or margin -- segment margin guidance. And the reason why we don't do it is we're going to see different -- at different times and in different places, we're going to have opportunities to invest. We're going to see different performance across business lines. You're going to have changes in comparability and lots of different factors that will have an impact, will create variability within the segments. And from our standpoint, we're really operating the company to deliver at least 50 basis points of margin at the company level, and that will come from a combination of new growth and existing changes and existing revenue scale, Operational Effectiveness, and the like. So from our perspective, it's hard to sit here right now and say that we will have room in one segment or another. We do have a high degree of confidence that we'll see margins grow for -- and certainly in 2015, by at least 50 basis points is the guidance that we talked about as well as our longer-term outlook. Thomas Hirsch : And I would just give a little bit more clarity there, a little bit detail around the segments. On the Payments side, clearly, we had a very strong year and we're operating at good scale and a lot of those operations continue to grow those very well. Financial was, as you well know, was flat on a year-over-year basis. We clearly had a few things going on there. We really had some difficult international comparisons. We're also investing, as Jeff highlighted, in our Agiliti platform during the year. We've also ramped up a lot of resources in our DNA business around implementation and development. And we also had a couple of small product line consolidations. So we have expanded margins in that segment about 200 basis points over the last 3 years. And we're confident as we look into the future, we're going to continue to expand margins in that segment. But as Jeff indicated, you're going to have different puts and takes in these segments as we go through future years also. Rayna Kumar : Got it. That's very helpful. Can you just talk a little about the size of your M&A pipeline and the businesses you're interested in acquiring? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, we wouldn't make any comments about the specifics of the pipeline. But I will say that we're focused on looking in areas to deploy capital from an acquisition perspective where we can increase the level of competitive differentiation in businesses where we have scale positions and we have opportunities. And we have an interest in the payments and channels area because we think that's an important area for clients and we think they're important growth drivers moving forward.  Of course, anything that we do from an acquisition perspective, we're always going to tie it back to our trade-offs against share repurchase. But there's obviously a lot of activity in the market and we're active in looking at that activity. We're active at looking at what's out there just to make sure we understand what's going on in the market at any point in time. Rayna Kumar : Okay, one quick final question for me. If you can just quantify the term fees in the fourth quarter and compare that to the term fees from the year ago quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, they were about flat compared to the prior year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Koning of Baird. David Koning : Yes. So just on the Payments segment, great acceleration through the year. In the context even of the bill pay transactions and debit transactions decelerating just a touch, is that due to a mix shift towards a little, like, maybe smaller bank transactions that yield higher? Maybe you can kind of just give us a little context why revenue accelerated while those had a little bit of deceleration. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. I think overall from a revenue standpoint, we've had some very good growth in payments really across the board. When you look at our channels, our bill payment, which had a lot of new wins, and our Output Solutions -- and we just really had a great year there, we're building a lot of recurring revenue. And our debit processing business continues to perform really exceptionally from a standpoint of growth. And I think our fourth quarter transaction growth in debit, David, was actually a little bit higher than the other quarters at 12% and the full year was 11%. So combination of new wins, a lot of integrated sales activities, along with DNA, et cetera, and those wins is helping that offering that we have with our integrated bill payment and debit, et cetera. So we have good momentum there. We have a little headwind in the current year in our biller business that's going to extend to the first half of next year. But outside of that, we have overall good momentum. Jeffery Yabuki : And the other thing I would say, Dave, is we're also -- have had some level of success in adding revenue in our, specifically in our bill payment business, which is not purely transactionally-based anymore. So we're changing that mix a little bit. And the other thing that's happened over the last, call it, the last 3, 4, 5 years is the bill payment business itself has become a smaller and smaller part of the Payments segment. So yes, the businesses are growing, but if you think back to the CheckFree days, obviously, the bill payment business was everything. It's become a lesser element of the segment. So the correlation to transaction growth isn't as pure as it once was. David Koning : Got you. Okay. And just -- I guess my follow-up, when you're guiding to 5% to 6% internal growth, that's a reported number, I'm assuming. I'm just wondering what FX headwind is kind of built in there? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we -- it is a reported number. We don't report on a constant-currency basis. So we've assumed that there will be negative input from currency. We have a variety of different scenarios in which we've worked into our analysis. It's one of the reasons why the range is a bit wider this year than when we entered 2014. So we expect currency to be down. I don't think any of us have a perfect crystal ball on where it's going to land, but we do expect it to weigh us down. But it is incorporated into our guidance for the year. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. And I think, Dave, the impact that we highlighted on the call was about 40 basis points in the quarter, about 20 basis points for the year. So we expect '15 to be greater than that clearly, but as Jeff indicated, we've incorporated the range into our broader guidance. So it's going to be a bigger headwind than what we had in '14. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I have a couple of questions on EMV. You mentioned you thought the timing of EMV adoption is kind of the key variable revenue driver in 2015. It kind of seems like a split is developing between the large banks that are reissuing their card portfolios. Small banks, maybe your customers, are kind of -- seem to be putting it off. I guess, a, is it a fair characterization? And, b, does it imply that at some point, you get a real kind of true-up and sort of more rapid migration in your base than is occurring now? Mark Ernst : Hey, Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst. Let me take that. The split that we see primarily is, first and foremost, between credit and debit. So what you've heard principally from the larger banks are those banks have a large credit portfolio and they are reissuing early around credit. And that's really because of some technical -- the technical issues which I think you're familiar with around kind of clarifying the Durbin rules as it relates to debit. The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycles started with debit. We think that, that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015. Indications that we can see out of our client base would say that they are kind of behaving or expecting to reissue in much the way that I think the larger banks have indicated they are on debit as well. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. I think the other thing to consider is that, within our business, we have -- we do card production for our debit clients and we also do card production for a broad range of clients who are not within our debit processing footprint. So we have a broader range of clients and we serve only in the debit processing business. But clearly it's -- again, one of the reasons why our range is larger this year is we don't have a perfect estimate of how that's going to lay in. We think it's an important opportunity that'll benefit Fiserv for the next several years. And so, obviously, we'll know more as we progress over 2015, but we feel good about that opportunity overall. Ramsey El-Assal: And just a quick follow-up on that -- the EMV kind of topic. How do we -- so you gave just a little color now in terms of quantifying the size of that opportunity. I mean, do you handle pretty much all the card printing for your bank customers? I understand now you have new customers outside just the bank footprint, but is this something where we can say there's a price of an EMV card and we're multiplying it by effectively every debit card issued in the Fiserv family of customers? Or is it more nuanced, than that, there's an outsourcing, there's some puts and takes or... Mark Ernst : Yes, again, it's a bit more nuanced than that. I mean, in general, yes, we know all those numbers and we can kind of model different scenarios. But the other kind of wild card in all this is to what degree some institutions will choose to stay with mag stripe only as a cost matter and accept the fraud risk once the conversion date occurs. So there's a number of kind of puts and takes in there, and I think different institutions are looking at risk in different ways. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And Ramsey, I would say one of the key topics that we'll discuss at our June Investor Day is in fact EMV and how we see -- how our model will take that in and what are the kind of the factors that will be considered as this comes in over the next several years. And clearly, it's important, and that's why we're going to give it some time in June. Mark Ernst : And by June, we'll have much more clarity, or more clarity, certainly. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Christopher Shutler : So first on Open Solutions. Can you just give us a quick update on the -- I think you've initially laid out $100 million and $60 million of revenue cost synergy targets and just how you're progressing against those? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. We're -- as I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to feel very good about the level of revenue synergies in the Open business. We, in the middle of last year -- or in the middle of '13 now, we indicated that we were moving our estimates up, because in fact the receptiveness of the Open Solutions base to taking the integrated products that we provide had been quite strong, and that continued. We had roughly 20-ish million of sales within that grouping in 13 and another 40 in 15, of which that, obviously, much of that has not come on yet. It'll come on over time, and so we see some benefits from that, and we'll continue to see opportunities within that base. We typically see in an acquisition that it takes 2 to 3 years to get our stride from a revenue synergy perspective. So we began to see it in the second half of last year, and we think that will continue throughout this year and early into '16. And we're also seeing some very nice opportunities from the Open Solutions product set, moving that back into the Fiserv client base as well. So very good movement on that front. And then, on the cost synergy side, we indicated again this year that a lot of the value that we drove in the Operational Effectiveness category came from Open Solutions. So again, we feel very good about that and are, in that case -- in both cases, actually, well on track if not ahead of where we anticipated we would be. Christopher Shutler : All right, great. And then, Jeff, I think you said that you had 14 million mobile users versus -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think you have around 70 million online banking users. At least, that's the latest number I have. Just curious how you're trying to increase adoption amongst the users given that it's a bit of a new skill set for Fiserv, not just -- not working just with the FIs, but also consumers. And to what extent you're banking on, I guess, revenue growth in the Payments segment over the next several years being driven by your success increasing mobile adoption? Jeffery Yabuki : I have to say this. Banking, no pun intended, right? Christopher Shutler : Exactly, Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : All right. Sorry. It's a great question. It is, again, one of the topics that we're going to cover in some level of depth at Investor Day, but I would say that we do see a lot of growth in terms of the opportunity to take mobile up to a large degree against that 70 million. Now in fairness, we don't believe we'll get all 70 million because some of those 70 million are on -- on the larger Corillian platform and some of that have -- some of those institutions have adopted Mobiliti, some of them have not. But we do see a much larger opportunity to grow specifically the ASP subscriber base, which we said we're near 3 million this year. That number is still at a very low level of penetration and we expect to see meaningful growth. We actually introduced a new program late in 2014 where we're working with our bank and credit union clients to help them drive better adoption in their client base. I mean, the beauty of mobile is that consumers want it and the financial institutions want consumers to use it. And so they're really looking for ways to drive that together. So we have very strong alignment. We see that to be a very big opportunity and you will continue to hear us talk about it, and we would expect that, over time, that'll continue to accelerate for us and drive some nice recurring revenue. Mark Ernst : The other thing I was going to add to that is to your point about this being a new skill set to some degree for Fiserv. One of the benefits that we have is given the broad range of financial institutions that are using some of these solutions, we now have the opportunity to look across that base of institutions and find those who are performing better versus others and understand and benchmark what they're doing and bring those best practices out to our other clients. That is proving to be very successful for us so far as we help our clients figure out how to better engage their customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Condra of BMO Capital Markets. Paul Condra : I wanted to ask a little bit about the NOW Network that you've been speaking about a bit now. But I wondered if we can get a little bit more detail just about what kind of new functionality it's going to have. Or who are going to be the kind of first users, the initial end users? And then, maybe provide us some detail about how that rolls on. What's the expected revenue impact? How should we be thinking about it? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Paul. I mean, the -- at a headline level, I mean, the purpose of the network is to create opportunities to have more data connected to the payments beyond point of sale. This is really to focus on the 55 billion payments that happen through the non-POS side of the system. And so we're looking at how do we use data, how do we use speed, how do we integrate those capabilities into applications such as bill payment and Popmoney to allow, we think, the important convenience aspect of these -- of electronifying in a much faster way these payments. So we would see this coming in over the next 3 to 5 years. An important element of this infrastructure is creating more electronification. Obviously, paper payments are only going to move at a certain pace. So one of the things that we are looking at is how do we create a faster and faster electronification. That's one of the aspects as well. We do see this to be an important revenue opportunity, again, over time, as we've seen institutions today be able to create differentiated pricing around this. And we think that's one of the areas that institutions will use to drive new value. I would say, on the call, that's probably about as much detail as we can go into, but we will talk about this in more depth in June. Paul Condra : As a follow-up, it sounds like you didn't raise your integrated sales target. And I'm just wondering if there's any shift in strategy there. Or how did you get to that number? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we didn't raise it in terms of where we performed this year versus last year. But we do think that the $250 million is an appropriate level. We were $250 million in 2014. We delivered $260 million. Obviously, we're always looking to deliver as much as we can, and we think it's appropriate at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Darrin Peller : Can you just provide a bit more color on the financial margin in the quarter and just the moving parts during 2015? I think -- I know you mentioned earlier the variable comp levels, and I think you said it was relative to last year's margin level. Maybe just, Tom, if you can give a little more explanation of what the driver was between last year's and this year's. And then, going forward, it's good to see once again another year of 50 basis points plus a margin expansion for '15. Is that -- what -- is that a function of mix and scale, or are there any cost initiatives? Can you give us a little color on the driving force? Thomas Hirsch : Okay, Darrin. I'll start with that one. And in the Q4 quarter, we had a couple of things. One is particularly in the Financial segment. First and foremost, if you look back at our margin in the fourth quarter last year, that's the highest margin I believe we've had ever in that segment, which was a very strong comparison to this quarter. The second thing is we had timing associated with some variable comp, both incentives and commissions. We had a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expensed commissions and we also had some ACEP, which is some variable comp, which we had to expense in the current quarter. And then, the other piece -- that was about 100 basis points. And then, the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix. It had a very difficult comparison. Also, we've had this during the year and it also accentuated in the fourth quarter. And then, we had some increased spending in our Agiliti platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlighted on the call, our margins in that segment over the past 3 years are up about 200 basis points. Clearly, as we look forward, and you indicated, where's the margin drivers going to happen? We are, clearly, from the Payments segment standpoint, at a good place. We're executing very well there, continue to drive incremental revenue on our recurring base solutions like card and bill payment and all the rest. Regarding financial, we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly, DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we're going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015. And so that scale is starting to return there as we've had to put more into development and implementation. And so we're confident overall, along with our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. We are -- have a number of those we're going to be executing in '15 that will benefit us in '16 and forward. So those things leave us much comfort that we're very confident that we're going to have margin expansion greater than 50 in 2015. Darrin Peller : Okay, that's great. I was just going to say -- I mean, when you compare to 2014 with all the investments you made in DNA, now that you're actually rolling on the vast majority of these clients, I would think there could be even better than 50 basis points now. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I mean, we're giving guidance at greater than 50 and we're highly confident that we're going to continue be able to expand margins through our high -- our focus on high -- Darrin Peller : That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up. I mean, Financials, like you said before, I mean, it was flat growth in '13 and it accelerated to 2% in '14. I know you're not really giving segment-level guidance. But these drivers, whether it's DNA or some of the larger clients, I mean, should we expect at some point that, that growth rate should continue to accelerate? Or is that a sort of a low single-digit growth while Payments really drives the engine for your overall top line? Thomas Hirsch : I think we're going to continue to have -- our Payments segment is going to be higher than our Financial segment clearly over time, just given the nature of the businesses that are in each segment. I do think, over the longer term, Financial segment should continue as we continue to expand our international, and to your point, continue to get a lot of revenue from DNA and other strong market share wins that we've had in the account processing space. So I think -- remember, the international stuff does fall into our Financial segment. And over the next few years, we continue to believe we're going to be growing there, and then clearly with the DNA implementations coming on in '15, that's going to also provide an accelerator. Darrin Peller : Okay, just a last question and I'll return to the queue. But on the free cash flow per share growth, you guys have always done a great job of not only generating a lot of free cash flow but returning it through buybacks, and guidance now suggests that continues. The only question I have is just the free cash flow per share guidance. I think you called for $4.12, if I remember correctly? Thomas Hirsch : At least $4.12. Darrin Peller : All right. Well, I guess what I'm wondering is why that's in sort of a high single-digit growth rate when you're calling for 11% to 14% EPS growth. And I think you mentioned earlier some moving parts on working capital, but any more color on that would be great. Thomas Hirsch : Okay. Yes, I think we had -- we significantly outperformed in the current year at $3.82 versus our greater than 3.60 -- $3.65 per share guidance. So when we looked at that, we did have some working capital that benefited us this year and some of that is going to reverse as we go forward into '15. But overall, Darrin, our compounded annual growth rate of free cash flow per share including '15, '14 and '13 is roughly 14% on a CAGR basis at the $4.12 level. And as you know, our guidance is greater than $4.12. So again, I think you're going to have some fluctuation in working capital, but we've really from a -- just from a free cash flow per share standpoint, we've had really some strong results. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan Securities. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Just a couple of follow-ups. Everything is pretty clean here. Just on the guidance, the revenue guidance, what it's going to take to get to the 6% adjusted revenue growth? You have some large deals that you see or maybe that could ramp to get you there. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, as you know, Tien-tsin, I mean, for us, it's difficult to do, to get large deals in here that make a big enough difference that we can have a meaningful impact. The big drivers for us are areas like EMV where we think there's a broad range of scenarios that we could see, depending on what happens in a market, what goes on with currency trends. And frankly, to get to the upper end, you'd have to have many more things go right than would not. I mean, we feel good about the range. And again, there are some things going on as we talked about that are a little bit different in '15 than we saw in '14. But we feel quite confident about where we sit today. And it won't be really sales-based, it'll be what goes on in kind of in the market -- or I'm sorry, what goes on within our client base currently. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood, understood. And then, just on FX. I heard those comments of 40 bps in the fourth quarter, but obviously the dollar strengthened quite a bit. Could it be as much of it -- as much of a -- could it round up to a 1% hit if current rates hold? Just trying to get a sense of where we stand today. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, as you know, our revenue is, call it, 6%, 7% outside. So I mean, we'd have to see, I think, some pretty negative things to have it be at that level, but we don't have a crystal ball. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, yes. I hate to be rounding basis points here but I figured I'd ask. Just one last follow-up if you don't mind for you, Jeff, just on tokenization. We've been doing a lot of research there. Can you just educate us on Fiserv's role or future role in a tokenized world? Are you aiming to be a token wallet provider? And there's a lot of definitions around token service providers, so what is Fiserv's role? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So I mean, I think at this stage, we are looking to play the most important partnering role we can with our clients. I'm sure you know, as well as I do, if not better, that there's lots of evolution going on with kind of the token control, in quotes, right now. So I mean, we do see opportunities there. And we actually see opportunities to think about tokenization even more broadly than just on the card side. So when you think about some of this 50 kind of -- how do you move with more speed and alacrity for the 55 billion payments that are outside of point of sale? We see some opportunities there as well. So I think it's an evolving topic right now. We are having lots and lots of conversations that would say that our clients would like to see us play an important role there. And so we're looking for what's the -- what -- how can we work with the existing provider space to make sure that we're doing the best thing we can for our clients and also driving as much value as possible on the shareholder side. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Brett Huff : One sort of big picture question. It was kind of hinted at in the last one. If you guys look out sort of 3 years, whatever your sort of medium-term horizon planning period is, what is the thing that, if you could spend more on, you'd really pour some gas on the fire because you think there's something there? I mean, like, I was thinking like Popmoney, maybe in Payments, I'm not sure what the equivalent is in the Financial segment. But what is that thing where you think the investment would be -- it's big enough that you really think you'd want to do more, if you could? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say this entire space outside of point of sale, these 55 billion payments, which includes everything from person-to-person to account-to-account to business-to-business, small business-to-consumer, consumer-to-small business, I mean, that space I really think about as the last horizon of payments. And the opportunity for us to work with financial institutions to ensure that non-FIs don't come in and take over that space. I mean, it's, as you know, it's a highly competitive world out there and there are lots and lots of providers trying to scrape away pieces of that value chain. So we're looking to both protect that value chain but more importantly protect it by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in a non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on. And I think the other big opportunity out there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we're going to see, over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made, so new -- basically through new products. So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then, thinking about how can you use the data to enhance those kinds of decisions, both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side. So I think those are 2 areas that are at least quite interesting to us as we think about where the world will go over time. And clearly, we are investing in those kinds of areas, but we're not doing it in an unconstrained way. We're doing it in a responsible way so we can continue to drive high-quality revenue to make sure that we can meet our margin commitments at the same time. Brett Huff : That makes sense. And as a follow-up, on bill pay, you mentioned that you're -- it sounds like the business model may be evolving a little bit. It's not as purely tied to a per-tran basis maybe. Is there a -- first of all, I want to make sure I understand that right. And second of all, is there a world in which bill pay stops being as a per-tran revenue and becomes more, I don't know, not all-inclusive or whatever, but more bundled, or even a license arrangement? I mean, is that a foreseeable outcome? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So Brett, I would say that we do see a variety of different ways in which we are driving value in the -- on the bill payment -- in the bill payment business. Some of it has to do with services, customization, so the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. I mean, one of the things that we talked about is that spend -- spend focus is really big time around customer experience. And as you know well, the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want is certainly one of the opportunities out there. And so we've had an opportunity to create some additional streams of revenue in that space. You've got some add-on transactional opportunities, whether it's around risk management, e-bill, those kinds of things. And then, there's another emerging category which really ties into this whole notion of systematic real-time, and that is premium transaction. So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end, so whether they be bill payment, P2P, or account-to-account transfer, linking that to real-time and then charging consumers a reasonable fee that they can -- so that they'll avail themselves of that real-time capability when it makes sense for their own situation. So you add all those up, and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently. And I think we've talked about the fact that there may be some point where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more, quote, premium or faster transactions. And so we are looking at different pricing models and different ways to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financial institutions and what we need. But I will say -- the only thing I would say is I don't see us moving to a license kind of a model. I see this continuing to be a cloud-based, an ASP solution, because there's a network effect that's very important. And we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving real-time transaction. So it is an evolving space for us. I'm quite excited about this evolution and believe that we are extremely well positioned to lead that over the next 3, 5, 7 years. Brett Huff : That's really helpful. And then, just last quick one. Did you guys talk at all about the tenor of what you think the deployment of the repo authorization might be this year? Jeffery Yabuki : Kind of how -- we did not give any guidance to how we'll move through the remaining shares. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : A couple of quick questions. Just first on the sales growth, another good year, the 12% year-over-year. Maybe Jeff, at a high level, the 2 or 3 key drivers of that? And then, also just to clarify, are the Open Solutions sales results included in that? Or is that sort of a separate metric? And then, what directionally would be the increase in the quota for '15? Jeffery Yabuki : So I would say, Glenn, that the easy answer is Open -- the Open Solutions -- the old Open Solutions business is included in there. And it was included in the -- on an actual basis. It was included in the prior year as well. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison. I mean, the big drivers in the sales results for the year are going to be around our account processing platforms. We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014 in terms of DNA, but also around Premier, Signature, Precision, Cleartouch. I mean, so we've had good success because the beauty of our product set is that we don't think there's a one-size-fits-all. We know that different institutions want different solutions. So the account processing business did well. Our lending business had a very good year, very happy with the work there. Our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well. And in fact, everyone had a good year. Card solution did very well. We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payment results were the highest that we've had since 2012. So really across the board. And I think it's -- it is a matter of having products that are appealing to clients on the account processing side where we have a good, strong, integrated value proposition because we're delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks. So that's worked out well and we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly, we don't -- we wouldn't talk about the numbers and quota, but I will say I think this is our third year in a row that we would say we've had record sales. And we're continuing to be in a place where we expect on the basis of the investments that we make, to continue to be able to drive increased sales. Part of that comes from being better with our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our Mobiliti for business which is our commercial -- our mobile -- I'm sorry, our commercial mobile solution. And that we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institutions over the next several years. So again, it's a combination of continuing to have the best sales force and also introducing new products. Glenn Greene : Okay. And for Tom, on the FX, Jeff, I think mentioned that international is 6% to 7% of revenue. Is that roughly evenly split between euro and the Aussie dollar, just so we can sort of like do our own modeling and think about it? Thomas Hirsch : I don't know if that's evenly split, and I can get back to you offline on that, Glenn. I think it's probably a combination of both and a few others, smaller ones. So that's how I would put that. And I'd say we're, as I highlighted, 40 basis points in the quarter, 20 basis points for the year, and we expect that to be bigger in '15 from a headwind standpoint. Glenn Greene : And then just real quick on the decrease in the year-over-year corporate costs, I thought I heard you say about lower incentive comp which I didn't really fully understand why that would be. Thomas Hirsch : No, no. Not on the -- I said lower consulting and legal costs and -- than in the prior year where we had an implementation of a new HR system which we had a lot of expense associated with. Operator : Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, you talked about gaining market share on the bill payment side. I'm wondering is the competitive environment changing? Or what are the drivers for you to be able to gain that market share? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I think what we said is we had our strongest sales quarter in the fourth quarter since 2012 and we had somewhere north of 300 wins for the year, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen going for the last several years. I would say it's twofold. It is, first and foremost, having what we believe is the best solution in the market, and that's especially important as speed becomes more and more important to consumers. So the ability to link up the, certainly, the, again, what we think is the best product in the market with some of our solutions such as PEP+ which are going to help today enable real-time. I think that's a big opportunity and a big differentiator. And then, secondly, the continuing ability to deliver that into our account processing base which, as you know, is somewhere in the area of 5,000 financial institutions. So it's really the combination of those 2 that's creating the success. Kartik Mehta : And then, just a question, Jeff, on -- or maybe a business that's been forgotten or not talked about with the check processing business. And as you see checks decline, are there opportunities for you out there in your client base, or outside your client base, to win that business and potentially help the check processing business as these banks come under pressure as their volumes are declining? Jeffery Yabuki : The theoretic answer is yes. I mean, I would say that, over time, there had been several different junctures where we believed that given the financial pressures, that there would be more motivation to outsource that solution. And today, we've had discussions but we frankly haven't seen a lot of movement in that space. And I'm sure there are a variety of reasons why. But for now, we certainly aren't counting on that happening when we think about forward revenue growth. If it happens, that's great. But it's certainly not part -- it's not an important part of our growth formula moving forward. Kartik Mehta : And then, Jeff, just a last question. Any benefits or hurdles from the regulatory environment that could help you grow revenue or win additional market share from others? Jeffery Yabuki : I mean, I think there is a general \"benefit\" in the market because of the level of regulatory scrutiny and pressure, which is causing institutions to take a good look at how they spend and are they getting the most -- are they getting the optimal value for that spend. I would say that's a more systemic benefit and that the providers themselves are generally equal on that front. Mark Ernst : There probably are a few of our product lines that are disproportionately benefiting from the regulatory pressure. We talked about the opportunity in lending, which has a strong kind of regulatory undercurrent to the changes that we've seen in that market. Jeffery Yabuki : Absolutely. Thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. I know we went a little bit longer than we typically do, but we appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's call.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. You may notice that we've excluded the performance metric summary from our slide presentation, but we'll continue to include relevant metrics in our prepared remarks based upon strategic focus, impact on our results and other meaningful factors. Let me also remind you that we are holding our Investor Day on Tuesday, June 16, in New York City. The general session will begin at 9 :30 a.m. and should end around noon, followed by an optional lunch discussion. Invitations will be sent out soon and we look forward to seeing you at the event. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year. We delivered internal revenue growth of 4% against what was, by far, our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. These results include a 1 percentage point drag on revenue from a combination of currency and lower termination fees in the quarter. Our continuing focus on high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency drove an increase in adjusted operating income of 8% and a 150-basis-point expansion in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% despite an 8 percentage point negative tax rate impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Free cash flow per share was up an impressive 22% in the quarter. Sales were 83% of quota in the quarter and slightly below last year's record Q1 results. We remain confident about our sales and revenue prospects for the remainder of the year. For the second straight year, we were recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. In April, we were also named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. In both cases, we were the only one of our core competitors to be recognized, which we believe is a reflection of our cultural focus on delivering superior value for our clients, associates and shareholders. We identified 3 key enterprise priorities for 2015 in our last call, which we will update you on each quarter. The priorities are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on Payment and Channel Solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. As I mentioned, internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter compared to 6% in last year's Q1, led by very strong performance in a number of our recurring revenue businesses. Growth was strong across several areas in the quarter, such as card services, digital solutions, including Mobiliti ASP, and account processing. We continue to focus on building high-quality recurring revenue, which should lead to an increase in our internal revenue growth rate again this year. This targeted growth profile also helps fuel our objective to sustainably grow operating margin which, for this year, is targeted to expand by at least 100 -- by at least 50 basis points. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points. Free cash flow per share was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, reflecting the results of our attractive business model combined with the benefit of consistent disciplined capital allocation. Overall, we are on track to deliver on each of our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, and we did just that in the quarter. We recently announced that Vibrant Credit Union, with assets in excess of $500 million, selected the DNA account processing platform, along with a number of Fiserv integrated solutions to help them deliver a unique experience to each of their 41,000 members. 4 new DNA clients went live in the quarter. We expect to more than double the number of new DNA institutions that go live this year as compared to 2014. Our core account processing growth opportunities extend well beyond DNA as our account processing offerings meet the needs of a diverse end market. During the quarter, a top 40 bank selected our Signature account processing platform, along with a full suite of our market-leading products, such as item processing, electronic bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the ACCEL network. We are excited about the opportunity to provide this new client a uniquely differentiated experience when they go live next year. Digital solutions and mobile in particular continue to be a high priority for the market. We added to our Mobiliti consumer business signing 36 new clients in the quarter. Late last year, we began implementing programs to help our clients drive higher levels of mobile adoption, which contributed to even stronger growth in Mobiliti ASP subscribers in Q1. Mobile usage also tends to enable a variety of value-add opportunities, such as real-time payments and deposits, mobile capture and Snap to Pay. As you may recall, our Mobiliti Business solution went live in the fourth quarter of last year. Through the end of Q1, we've already signed 8% of the business banking client base to this important new solution. Although only a handful of clients are currently live, we expect this strategic product to drive value for some of our clients' most profitable customers and an attractive recurring revenue stream for us. We just wrapped our Spring forum client event, where we hosted nearly 4,000 people, representing a broad range of financial institutions, billers, lenders and other purveyors of financial products. At forum, we provided updates on our market-leading solutions and latest innovations from across the company. Our solutions center was highly trafficked with more than 2,000 unique visits to different product areas, including the NOW network, digital solutions, real-time payments, lending, billing, EMV and investment services. We are pleased with the early returns from forum and look forward to our next event coming in the fall. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation in value for our clients. While we expect to cover several of these opportunities in depth at our Investor Day, some highlights for the quarter include a new unique agreement with Morgan Stanley to jointly provide a global turnkey asset management platform for financial institutions outside the U.S. Our market-leading managed account technology solution, which now supports multicurrency, portfolio accounting, model management and trading, will be combined with the breadth and expertise of Morgan Stanley to create differentiated value and an attractive source of brand new growth. We're excited about this opportunity and expect to go live in early 2016. We're gaining traction in embedding our real-time payment capabilities into CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. Real-time transactions were up 54% in the quarter, which has a dual benefit of meeting a critical customer need while delivering high-quality fee revenue for our clients. We also advanced our new real-time deposit capability in the quarter. This newer use case allows consumers faster, guaranteed access to their funds and drives fee revenue for our clients. These real-time opportunities, which are generally enabled by the NOW network, are a strong link to changing consumer expectations. Interest for Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, expanded once again in the quarter. The far-reaching demand has moved from being core-based to include several key add-on solutions, such as card processing, digital capabilities and risk. We continue to build out our integrated platform and expect to go live later this year. Last, we continued our focus on EMV. The number and level of client conversations remains elevated and we've increased our capacity to deliver against the anticipated market demand. And while debit EMV card issuance continues to lack credit, we expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year and expect that to continue over the next several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter, against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface, given the negative currency impact along with lower termination fees which, together, push our growth rate down by 1 percentage point. Growth in our card processing, digital channels, including Mobiliti, account processing and risk solutions led our performance in the quarter. This high-quality revenue growth and a continued focus on operational efficiency drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $371 million and an impressive 150 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, increasing 9% over last year. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by about $0.07 or 8 percentage points of growth from this year's much higher comparable tax rate due to significant discrete tax benefits in last year's first quarter. Moving onto the segment results. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue, all internal, was up 4% to $613 million compared to one of our strongest growth quarters in the past several years. Growth was led by our card processing and digital channels businesses and was partially offset by the anniversary impact of some larger bill payment client implementations and biller headwinds. We believe the Payments segment revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark of the year as biller headwinds ease at the end of the second quarter, ongoing conversion of the Mobiliti backlog, Output Solutions revenue acceleration and the early revenue benefit of EMV. For reference, we continue to expect that the majority of the EMV-related revenue will bias to later in the year. Debit transaction growth was a very strong 12% in the quarter, driven by the dual benefit of growing card usage and strong sales. Mobiliti growth was excellent as backlog grew and ASP subscribers increased 65% year-over-year to more than 3.2 million. Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and P2P transactions grew 30% in the quarter. Our focus on delivering value-added services in these solutions closely aligned -- aligns with the industry's focus on faster payments. Real-time transactions were up more than 50% in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 6% to $191 million and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. This solid performance includes the offsetting negative impact of additional investments in several areas, including Biller Solutions and expanding our EMV capabilities. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 3% to $594 million. Performance was solid in our recurring revenue businesses, including account processing and lending, notwithstanding the more than 1% negative revenue growth impact from currency and lower termination fees. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 10% to $204 million. This very strong performance translated to a 220-basis-point increase in segment adjusted operating margin for the quarter. These results were driven by high-quality revenue growth in our account processing businesses and the positive impact from our operational efficiency programs. The corporate segment generated an operating loss of $24 million, which is in line with last year's results. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 35%, up sharply compared to the prior year, but in line with our full year expectations. Last year's tax rate of 30% benefited from significant discrete tax benefits. Free cash flow per share is one of our most important performance metrics. Free cash flow in the quarter was up significantly to $268 million and up an even stronger 22% on a per share basis to $1.10. Strong operating earnings growth and working capital improvements drove the excellent quarterly results. Total debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We allocated $290 million to share repurchase in the quarter, buying 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $75 per share. There were 16 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase at quarter's end. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. Sales for the quarter were solid at 83% of quota. These results were slightly off last year's exceptional Q1 results, but generally consistent with expectations coming off our very strong Q4 finish. We had several high-profile wins in the quarter, which demonstrate the power of both our integrated value proposition and the innovation that we are supplying to the dynamic market. For the full year, we expect actual sales value to be up roughly 10% compared to last year's record level. Integrated sales were $44 million or 18% of our full year goal. During the quarter, we also passed through the $900 million mark for cumulative integrated sales in the second phase of our program, which we launched in 2010. We expect to surpass our 5-year program goal of $950 million of total integrated sales in the second quarter. We're on track with our Operational Effectiveness goals, achieving $13 million in the quarter and are making good progress against our infrastructure consolidation this year. For example, we expect to complete our Alpharetta building project and consolidate a number of our Atlanta-based facilities and over 2,000 associates in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only do we expect increased associate engagement and enhanced client interaction, we also expect to see meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. There were only 5 regulatory actions in the quarter, which was consistent with last year's level. While at forum, we had the opportunity to hear directly from our clients about their priorities and technology focus. Tone continues to moderately improve and strategic conversations tend to center on building revenue, delivering digital capabilities, faster payments and a focus on differentiated customer experiences. Overall, we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 to $3.83, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year. We also expect internal revenue growth to further accelerate in the second half of the year as more of our sales and related revenue come online. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points and, importantly, that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We're on track to meet our financial and strategic commitments, which include recording an increase in the rate of internal revenue growth for the third consecutive year. These results and the third-party recognition I mentioned upfront are a strong testament to the focus and dedication of our more than 21,000 associates who drive value for our clients each and every day. With that, Mary, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Good margins here. I want to ask on that first. Just the 150 bps expansion, despite the lower term fees, anything unusual this quarter and that you'd consider raising your margin outlook for the year, given the big start in Q1? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I'll take that and Jeff will add to that. And I think there was -- really wasn't anything unusual in there. It's again the layering on to that high-quality recurring revenue that we really have in both segments. And it's been a big focus of our company, as you know, over the last several years as we've kind of accelerated our revenue -- internal revenue growth rate, and we plan on doing that again this year. So again, high-quality recurring revenue, continuing to focus on our operational efficiencies, and those are the primary drivers. And at this time, we're not going to be changing our guidance. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say, Tien-tsin, that it's early in the year. I mean, we expect to continue to perform well throughout the year. And we'll obviously take a better look at that when we get through at least the first half. Just to accentuate a point that Tom made, for several years as you will recall, we talked about making investments in some of our new products solutions, such as Mobiliti ASP, which we had to spend a lot of capital both human and financial, upfront, build the solution, sell it, distribute it, continue to add feature and function. And now we're getting to a point where we have scale. And as that scale -- as we continue to add users, we continue to get nice drop through benefits in that. So it's solutions like that, that are really adding to our margin because of that focus on this high-quality recurring revenue. Tien- Tsin Huang : All right. So high incremental margins, got it. Just as my follow-up and I guess just on the EMV front. I know you said that, that could push you to the higher end for the year on the revenue side. Just curious, at what point would you start to have enough order flow for you to sort of make that call that it's coming through? I'm guessing we won't see a lot of change over close to the holidays. So I'm just trying to understand the timing of when that might be visible to you. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, sure. Thanks. And I mean I would say that we always knew that the EMV revenue would buy us to late in the year. We've got -- we've just, as I mentioned, had our client conference. We had lots and lots of discussion around EMV. We've got a lot of demand that is building in the pipeline. And frankly, we won't know enough until at least into the third quarter on where we'll end up biasing for the year. I would say right now, we would be slightly below where we would have expected to be or where we potentially anticipated to be. And it's only because of the timing of institutions. On the other side of the coin, I would say, we're increasingly optimistic about the size of the opportunity, and we'll certainly talk more about that at Investor Day. Operator : Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Could you update us specifically on sales performance in the quarter of DNA? Anything to call out in terms of new bookings and competitive trends? Thomas Hirsch : Yes. I would say we had -- definitely had some wins in the quarter. We had very strong fourth quarter. Last year, we had a couple of transaction that slid from Q4 to Q1, which make Q4 -- I'm sorry, made Q1 quite strong last year. We continue to be extremely happy with the performance of DNA. We expect to more than double the number of go lives we have this year. We mentioned the Vibrant Credit Union win. It was a very nice win against one of our more entrenched competitors. And so we continue to have a lot of interest in the solution on the larger credit union side as well as on the large bank side as more and more of the bank -- the larger banking institutions are looking at real-time as an option and given that DNA is the only real modern technology platform that is U.S.-based, interest is quite high. Jeffery Yabuki : And I'll just add to that that the pipelines that we have right now have never been stronger for that both on the credit union and the banking side. So we're very pleased with that. David Togut : Great. And just as a follow-up, I noticed that you didn't provide a metrics page in the handout, Tom, although you did -- I think Jeff went through a couple of metrics. Perhaps you could give Operational Effectiveness versus target? And then, if you could provide the breakout of term fees both for the first quarter of this year and then the year-ago number. And just to slip in one more, just the quarter end share count. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, we've -- obviously, all the metrics -- we put all the metrics inside our script, David. So they are all in there. We just have a number of different metrics that will change over time, depending on relevance. And so -- but all those metrics are in there. We have 13 million of Operational Effectiveness benefits in the quarter, so another strong quarter of execution. And so that was very positive. Regarding the share count, as of April 30, that is 236.8 million. As of March 30, it was 237.7 million regarding that. And regarding term fees, they're down approximately $5 million from where we were last year, so that was roughly a 50-basis-point hit to our growth rate. David Togut : Anything to call out in terms of term fee comparisons for 2Q to 4Q? Thomas Hirsch : We did have, as you know, last year -- when we look back at last year, I think our first quarter of last year was our lowest quarter of the year until we were down here in the first quarter compared to last year. And then it kind of accelerated through the year. They were pretty consistent. So when you look at 2014, and we continue to manage that within our overall guidance in depth. But overall, in the first quarter, they were down. And again last year, in the first quarter was our lowest level. Jeffery Yabuki : And David, the Operational Effectiveness goal for the full year is $50 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Relative to the 30 DNA wins you're expecting to capture this year, I think you mentioned 4 came in, in Q1. Was that in line with what you had expected? Or did any deals slip out into the following quarters? And can you maybe just update us on the profile of those on-boardings you expect? Is it more back end-loaded than front half? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Thanks, Jim. The -- so just for clarity, we had 4 new DNA clients go live in the first quarter. We expect that to be 30 or so for the full year that will bias into the second half of the year. And some of our very large implementations will go live in the second half of the year. We're on track where we would expect it to be on those implementations. I'm going to separate that from sales for a minute. The sales momentum is quite strong. As Tom mentioned, the pipeline is at its fullest level ever. And we are seeing a lot more interest from larger institutions, frankly, those institutions that would not be having the conversations with us, but for the fact that we have this modern technology platform. Again, when we acquired Open Solutions, we anticipated a number of benefits. Frankly, we had not anticipated the fact that the world would change so dramatically since January 2013 that real-time would become so critical, along with the processing and data capability of that platform. So we're involved in a number of larger transactions. Now the negative, to the extent there is one, is those larger transactions tend to have long sales cycles. But we're excited to be in there. And frankly, another of the benefits is, as you know, we have a lot of very strong relationships with large financial institutions that tend to be based in our payments, technologies or -- and/or our channels technologies, our risk technologies. And this is now giving us an opportunity to be able to go in and have more wholesome conversations centered on the core processing solution of DNA. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up. One of your primary competitors this quarter cited some significant or increasing pricing pressure in debit processing. I was wondering if, first of all, that's something that you see in the market? And second, if it -- if so, is it big enough to impact your results as you head through the year? Jeffery Yabuki : So we announced in the quarter that we have 12% debit growth. Obviously, that's coming from a combination of what I would call a kind of a lag utilization rate in the market. And -- but the other real factor is we have a significant sales engine. And the majority of our sales really come from selling into our existing client base. So we've got a number of over 5,000 account processing clients. We've developed differentiation that's centered in integration, whether it's into the core or into our mobile services, risk services, et cetera. So that's a very different value proposition. Now we're also competing against some of the larger players that are not connected to our core. But the reality is, is that the majority of our success has historically come from the integration value that we can create in core. And that's a different sales, a different transaction, certainly, we have to price into the market. But frankly, because we can deliver value that no other provider can deliver, we are able to create a better arrangement overall. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to clarify something that you said on DNA. Are you expecting the kind of cadence of your implementations to flow more into the back half of the year? Or is it more of sort of a steady stream and you're just expecting a couple of large ones in the second half? Jeffery Yabuki : We are expecting in the range of 30 for the full year. We had 4 in the first quarter. And they will continue to ramp. The beauty of an account processing client is they're -- it's recurring revenue and it lasts typically for a long period of time. The downside is implementation cycles are anywhere from 12 to 24 months. So if you think back to the successes that we've had in winning these clients, as they go, it just takes time to go live. So I do see it being biased to later in the year, both in terms of absolute numbers as well as in terms of some of the sizing of the transactions, primarily because of when the wins -- when we won the clients. And we think that will continue into the following year. So we're going to continue to have success in that arena. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. This is sort of a longer view of the question, is asking for your longer view on sort of margin expansion over the next 24 or 36 months. I mean, obviously, there's some great intrinsic operating leverage in the business. Are there any product categories or areas of cost takeout that you think are particularly -- would be a particularly sort of consistently additive source of margin expansion over time? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, when you think about the margin expansion, as you said, it really comes from 2 primary arenas. It comes from scaling, either scaling new product investments or being additive to existing solutions that are already scaled. So that's 1 category. Within that category, we're always looking for how can we be more efficient part to be able to expand margin, but frankly part of that is to ensure that we're able to continue to invest in our products in a meaningful way. The other big piece of margin expansion, frankly, is on the Operational Effectiveness that we have been executing really fairly well since 2007. Most of that work has not touched our infrastructure today. We've done -- we've had small numbers of data centers to be consolidated. We've done a location here or there. We're now focused on making sure that we are able to leverage the company that we built over the last -- for the last 3 to 5, 7 years. And Tom and I both talked about the fact that we're doing these infrastructure consolidations. So we're doing more on the data center front. We're doing more in looking for ways to bring people together to create better communities of effort around our clients. And then lastly, we're also continuing to focus on what are the right ways for us to get the best leverage across our labor bases. We're pretty spread out. We still have lots of opportunities to create value there. So those are the 3 areas that we're really focused on right now from an Operational Effectiveness. Combined with the scale, that really gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to expand margin consistent with our long-term guidance in the foreseeable future. Lastly, I would say that you'll see us spend a fair amount of energy on this at Investor Day to be able to provide confidence for the next several years that, that will continue, not just for us, but for also for you, our owners. Operator : Next is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Darrin Peller : Listen, just want to quickly follow up on the margin first. I mean, obviously, I think it's a follow-up to Tien-tsin's question earlier. 150 basis points in the quarter was clearly more than we had anticipated. We did anticipate some expansion, but still when I look at the G&A number, Tom, over the past -- I don't think I've seen it that low over the past 5 quarters. I mean, is there anything -- and I think you said there was nothing unusual. So I guess the bigger question is, is that new G&A number sort of sustainable at that run rate or maybe on a percentage of revenue basis you can look at it that way? And then I just have a follow-up on the drivers on mobile for a moment. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think and, Darrin, you may be looking at kind of the GAAP number, and sometimes that GAAP number includes kind of a higher levels of severance like we had in the previous quarter last year. So when we look at our SG&A rate today, we do believe that is sustainable. Clearly, it's going to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We don't manage it that way. But we continue to believe we're at a good place there, and we'll continue to leverage in our operating model. Darrin Peller : All right. I guess just more broadly, Tom, and I mean, G&A overall just your cost structure. It sounds like there's nothing unusual in that number -- in the overall expenses number. So that percentage of revenue margin-wise sounds like that's a good number. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, absolutely. Darrin Peller : That's great to hear. All right. And then just listen, on the mobile side, again, the growth rate has been outstanding. And I guess we just want to understand, in terms of business mix, I know you guys have been somewhat reluctant to call out specific percentage of revenue for mobile. But what about just overall online banking mobile, some of the more digital initiatives on that front? If you can give us a little more color on percentage of your business now because obviously it's a big growth driver for you. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. You're right, we have stayed away from that and we're going to continue to stay away from that at least for today's call. We'll supply a bit more detail on that at Investor Day because it really is becoming a bigger part of the business. And we actually see it -- we see it being able to become an even larger part of the business going forward, not just in terms of driving subscription revenue or license revenue -- or services revenue, depending on the deployment method, but also the importance of mobile as it kind of drags along additional capabilities, whether they be payments and the like. So we will definitely spend more time on it. The point that we were trying to make earlier, just as it relates to margin, is as you know, Darrin, we were -- we've been investing in this for a number of years. We're now at the point where we're -- we've hit the tipping point, and we would expect it to be fairly positive for us from now over the next several years. Darrin Peller : And I guess, later in the year, with term fees coming on or a more normal comp, that's -- I guess, as a follow-up to the question earlier on the call, that should only be better, right? Thomas Hirsch : That's correct, but we're going to continue to make investments as we go. So I mean, we obviously are sticking with our guidance right now of 50 basis points for the -- at least 50 basis points for the full year. We need to get past Q2 and take a look at it before we make any adjustments. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we did have -- as I previously said, Darrin, we did have higher levels of termination fees in the last 3 quarters of last year, just so you're fully aware of that. Darrin Peller : Okay, on a comp basis, makes sense guys. All right. Thomas Hirsch : Thank you. Operator : Next is David Koning of Baird. David Koning : Yes, so I guess the first question it sounded like you were talking about the second half being better than the first half in terms of growth. But it looks like the second quarter is actually the easiest comp of the year. And I'm wondering, should Q2 be better than Q1 in growth, just given it's a much easier comp? Jeffery Yabuki : Dave, I would say that, again, when we went all the way back to our call, when we kicked off the year in January, we really believe the second half is where it's going to be primarily. And the reasons for that are some of the things that we've already talked about are the DNA implementations, we're going to have some larger benefits from both our bill payment and international business. Our Biller headwinds, we mentioned this, that in our Biller business, which is really growing our electronic transactions, they are double-digit. We've had some tough comparisons there with some client consolidation. And those headwinds are going to bake towards the end of the second quarter. And then, also, we talked about our EMV revenue, which is primarily all second half kind of driven. So again, we continue to believe we're going to have a much stronger second half than first half. And as we're sitting here today, that continues to be that trend. David Koning : Okay. Okay and then, I guess the only other question I had on the posted July, we never really pay attention to that, but is that -- are we going to be able to see that clearly ramp? That's maybe one of the biggest indicators that we can just see, the underlying EMV kind of driving the payments growth. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think -- I don't think it will be reflected there because of the card production. But I would comment to that, as you saw, one of the reasons in our payment segment, our Output Solutions business was fairly flat. We kind of had a difficult compare we have compared to the prior year. And again, that's one of the businesses where we really expect a better second half due to acceleration both in the base business and then also in the EMV production. As Jeff highlighted, we're primarily on the debit side, which is going to trail credit and, therefore, that's when we expect to see that. Operator : Next is Chris Shutler of William Blair. Christopher Shutler : I thought that the comment on the Morgan Stanley relationship was interesting, guys. Maybe you can provide a little bit more detail on how that opportunity developed, who's going to be doing what. And maybe just some more color overall on what the product is going to look like. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. It's a unique arrangement. As you may know, we've got a very strong position in, call it, just broadly managed account administration in the U.S. We have a very strong pricing network, a very large scaled business. And we've been working with Morgan Stanley for a couple of years. They've wanted to have a way to expand their business. And we began working together, look, how could we use our technology with their knowledge of the business and their connectivity outside the U.S. And we basically put this together in a way that allows really them to go out and take the lead almost prime, go out, make -- form and leverage their relationships outside the U.S., get it set up with product, et cetera, and then we'll go in and do the managed account administration as we do here. And so we're quite excited about it. It's nothing that we've done before. And frankly, we have a pretty high level of confidence in this because we spend a lot of time understanding Morgan Stanley's capabilities and how they're going to approach the market. And so we're pretty excited. We think it's going to drive some growth into '16. It won't have any impact this year, but it's just another driver for '16. Christopher Shutler : Sure, okay. And then just one other one, a totally different question. But I was hoping to get an update of the integrated sales efforts, specifically with former Open Solutions clients. So just wondering if there's still a big opportunity or just what inning you're in there in that opportunity? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, sure, Chris. So we are -- continue to be very, very pleased with the success that we're having in providing additional value add solutions to that base, whether it's in the DNA base or the total plus [ph] base, we've had a lot of success in delivering product. We did a lot of work, as you'll recall, over the last 15, 18 months in terms of driving what I would call the first level of integration. We're now starting to bring in some of our next tier higher value -- higher integration value products. And so we are -- we remain very confident that we're going to hit or frankly exceed the revenue synergy numbers that we talked about when we acquired -- when we acquired Open. The beginning question is an interesting question because from a sales inning perspective, we're probably somewhere in the middle innings in terms of aggregate values sold. In terms of the revenue recognized on that, I would say we're in the very early stages of the ballgame and have a lot of runway left ahead. Some of that is because of implementation cues. Some of it is we've signed contracts that don't expire for -- where they have competitive agreements that don't expire for a period of time. But again, that's one of the things that gives us confidence, not just into the second half of this year, but frankly, on our exit run rate. So it's pretty early on that opportunity. Operator : Next is Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : So Jeff, interesting, because we do read a lot about real-time payments, interesting to hear your emphasis increasingly perhaps across Fiserv's business on how faster payments can drive growth. Can you be a little more granular? Do you think most of your opportunities are in terms of market share, given your technology sophistication and position or do you think it's pricing or a combination of the 2? And I'm thinking about your comments, both with regard to DNA as well as Mobiliti. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So it's a great question. And hopefully, I'll capture in this answer. So I think about real-time on several levels, but you've got solutions, such as DNA, which I think of a little bit more as a file drawer. And we're creating this real-time capability that allows for a lot of optionality to put files in that drawer, which are the real-time applications. So it could be deposits, it could be data management, it could be payments, any of those different opportunities. And we're going to see that both in real-time core. But the mandate is coming much more off of how consumers are accessing those technologies or frankly how business owners are accessing those technologies through Mobiliti and online and the like. And we're in the enviable position of having both the account processing or the core platform as well as the channels platforms, which we have a very long legacy on the online side that we're now complementing on the mobile side. That, however, is only part of the opportunity. Frankly, I am at least, if not more, excited about the second part of the opportunity, and that is, that today, because of the solutions that we have in the market, be it the CheckFree RXP solution or Popmoney, or ACH solutions, we have rails today, which are slower rails but are moving many, many, many millions and millions and billions of transactions. And what we're seeing is financial institutions get quite excited about the opportunity to provide real-time capabilities, payments and deposits. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. Real-time deposit credit is another intriguing opportunity, where institutions can create small fees that make sense to the consumer and make sense to them. So they can create a little bit of fee revenue, consumers can get what they want from a time to move or speed to move perspective. And because we're the enabling party, we're getting that as well. And my belief is that we're going to see some meaningful percentage, take bill pay, where we've got roughly 1.5 billion transactions a year. Some meaningful percentage of those have the propensity to go on a real-time basis. And that will create real value, not just in terms of growing the transactions, but on a RevPAR trend basis, that could be very, very impactful to our model over time. So it's a little bit of a long-winded answer. You can be sure we're going to talk about this at Investor Day. But it's a very, very important opportunity. And uniquely it's a place where the interest of consumers or users, whether they be retail or business, the financial institution, whether that be a bank, a credit union, a lender, a biller, whoever it is, and our interests all intersect at this point of real-time. Andrew Jeffrey : And that's helpful. Would we -- would you expect to see the adoption of real-time payments or the offer of real-time payments and bill pay for example 2 consumers be accompanied by new fee structures for those of us who have been using bill pay for a long time, we're accustomed to for the most part having free payments albeit with the lag? Would you expect to see financial institutions introducing more tiered pricing? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, absolutely. And in fact, we talked about our real-time payments being up more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. Almost, I would estimate that virtually, every one of those payments carried a premium fee -- every one of those real-time payments carried a premium fee structure. Could be like a reverse interchange, but a variety of different premium add-ons are in that more than 50%. Operator : Our last question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm just curious on the EMV opportunity. We're hearing different things. I guess how big of a revenue opportunity is that for you guys? I mean, is that upwards of $100 million on an annual basis? And any possibility that they delay the October liability shift that you're hearing about? Thomas Hirsch : So that -- the EMV opportunity is meaningful. There's no question about that. And we're going to talk about that in detail at our Investor Day in terms of quantifying the sizing of that. We have EMV benefits coming from 2 places. We have EMV benefits coming from our existing debit processing clients. And then we also have clients who are not our debit processing clients, who have a relationship with us through our Output Solutions business, both on the manufacturing and on the personalization side. So we'll spend time on that on Investor Day. As it relates to the liability shift, we haven't heard anything that would have us believe that that shift -- that there's going to be a delay in the shift. So we are at least planning for that to happen on time. Bryan Keane : Okay. And then just 1 question for Tom. Just how big or how -- if you can quantify the impact of term fees in the guidance for this year, that will be helpful. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, we don't. I mean, we don't quantify certain impact. So it's factored into our guidance. Clearly, one of the things I would say, Bryan, is we're coming off a very strong year in 2014 from a termination fee standpoint. So I mean that's kind of context for it. Bryan Keane : Okay, so we'll be down this year on the... Thomas Hirsch : It's hard to -- every year, we have puts and takes and things happen in the marketplace and sometimes, they come quickly. But we did have a very strong, at least, last 3 quarters of last year in regards to termination fees. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We always appreciate it. And we're looking forward to seeing everyone on June 16th in New York for our investor presentation. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great evening. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Ms. Gregor, you may begin. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. At last month's Investor Day, we shared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow, and most important, our plans to deliver compelling and differentiating value to clients. We are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We delivered another quarter of solid results, including 4% internal revenue growth, strong margin expansion and excellent free cash flow. Importantly, our results were in line with our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year financial performance outlook. Adjusted operating income growth was 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin performance was exceptional, increasing 120 basis points in the quarter to 31.8%. Adjusted EPS was up 17% in the quarter and is up 12% year-to-date. Free cash flow totaled $439 million for the first 6 months of the year, and importantly, free cash flow per share through June is up a very strong 18% for the period. We also gained sales momentum, recording a sequential increase in sales value of 11% in the quarter and a 10% increase over the same period last year. We are poised for revenue acceleration in the second half of the year and expect to exit the year positioned to increase our internal revenue growth rate again in 2016. Each quarter, we update you on progress against our 3 strategic focus areas, which given our recent Investor Day, will be a bit more abridged than normal. The 3 areas are : First, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. We've executed well in the quarter and year-to-date, delivering 4% internal revenue growth despite more than 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds in both periods. Our high-quality revenue strategy supported strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points in the first half of the year. Our focus on market differentiation breeds high-quality revenue, and that helped us sign Synchrony Bank with over $35 billion of assets to our Signature account processing platform in the quarter, along with a broad suite of payments solutions. Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on our payments and channels business. During the quarter, we added more than 100 new retail and business clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution, and exited the quarter with more than 3.5 million retail subscribers. Our focus on digital services has us positioned to deliver unique client value for years to come. At our Investor Day, we shared our strategy for expanding biller services as part of our commitment to further adoption of realtime payments. We moved the needle in the quarter by significantly expanding our on-demand payment relationship with Direct Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the nation. We also signed a top 40 financial institution for our e-bill and bill matrix solutions in the quarter. And lastly, U.S. Bank, the fifth largest bank in the country, selected Biller Advantage to provide electronic billing, presentment and payments to a broad range of its business customers. We were also excited to announce that United Way, the largest privately supported nonprofit organization in the world, will now allow any of the roughly 6 million U.S. donors to use Popmoney to make contributions directly from a digitally enabled bank account. Interest in DNA remain strong across all size institutions and charter types, which was again evident in our sales results. For example, Georgia's Own Credit Union, a $1.9 billion institution with over 180,000 members, selected our DNA platform for its advanced technology, strong commercial capabilities and an open architecture that will enable enhanced service to its members. We had 11 new DNA clients go live in the first half of the year versus 15 in all of last year. We remain on pace to double the number of DNA implementations this year. As many of these clients have selected a full suite of Fiserv's solutions, we expect to see revenue benefits across both reporting segments. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation for our clients. Our new Agiliti solution was recently included on the innovators list for Transaction Services by Global Finance Magazine. This recognition is for banks and FinTech providers that use cutting-edge technology to disrupt the Transaction Services market. We also had 5 clients recognize at the Retail Banker International Awards for initiatives executed in conjunction with Fiserv. These highly regarded awards focus on organizations that deliver excellence for their customers. We are pleased to partner with each of these organizations to provide technology and innovation that enables best-in-class results. Realtime money movement is at the forefront of many financial industry conversations which is right in our wheelhouse. We provide realtime processing capabilities for a number of clients. And accordingly, realtime transactions grew over 40% in the quarter and are up nearly 50% year-to-date. We also announced a strategic partnership with Early Warning services to further extend our realtime reach and capabilities. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quarter when excluding the 60 basis point negative impact from foreign currency. The net change in license and termination fee revenue was not material to our results in either the quarter or year-to-date period. Our focus on high-quality revenue growth and optimizing efficiency in our business model continues to pay off. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $390 million and $761 million, respectively. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year to 31.8%. First half adjusted operating margin is up 140 basis points, driven by high-quality revenue and scale benefit across both segments, along with continued operational efficiency savings. While we continue to expect strong margin performance, we have a more difficult margin comparison for the balance of the year, as the second half adjusted operating margin in 2014 was nearly 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.95 in the quarter, and for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up 12% to $1.83, even with a $0.05 headwind from a higher year-to-date tax rate. Now I will move on to the segment detail. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment accelerated sequentially to 6% in the second quarter from 4% in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue was $627 million in the quarter, led by strength in our card services, biller, bill payment and digital channels divisions. Results in our Output Solutions business were relatively flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from larger-than-normal breach reissuances last year and lower-than-anticipated EMV-related revenue year-to-date. As we indicated at Investor Day, we continue to invest in preparation for EMV and enter the second half of the year with a good-sized production order book. However, we continue to see variability around the timing of EMV revenue, especially in debit and prepaid, which is the majority of our secure card client base. During the quarter, we further extended existing relationships with our market-leading payment solutions, signing 40 debit and 70 bill payment clients in the quarter. Transaction growth rates held steady, with debit in the low-double digits and bill payment in the low-single digits. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continued to have success across our recurring revenue, Mobiliti ASP retail and business solutions. Payments segment operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $208 million and year-to-date was up 9% to $399 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 190 basis points to 33.2% for the quarter. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin is up a very strong 130 basis points to 32.2%, driven by high-quality revenue growth and strong operating leverage. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment grew 2% in the quarter to $609 million and 3% in the first 6 months of the year to $1.2 billion. Segment revenue growth, led by our account processing and lending solutions divisions, was partially impacted by a 70 basis point negative currency impact in the second quarter. Operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% in the quarter to $209 million. And for the first half of the year, was up 6% to $413 million. Despite a very difficult prior year comparison, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.5%. Through June 30, the segment adjusted operating margin is up 130 basis points to 34.4%. Our strong results have been driven by scale centered growth in our account assessing and lending businesses, along with benefits realized from our operational efficiency programs, partially offset by solution investments, including our Agiliti platform. Corporate segment net operating performance for the second quarter and year-to-date are in line with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.6% in the quarter, which was slightly lower than the prior year. The adjusted tax rate of 34.9% through June was 180 basis points higher than the prior year's rate of 33.1% due to larger discrete tax benefits recognized in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect a 35% adjusted effective tax rate for the full year. We are pleased with our strong free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Free cash flow increased 11% to $439 million, and on a per share basis, grew 18% over the prior year to $1.82. We anticipate much higher tax payments in the second half of the year, which will likely compress free cash flow growth in that period. We took important steps to improve our long-term debt structure and flexibility in the quarter. First, we extended the maturity on our $2 billion revolving debt facility to April 2020. We also raised $1.75 billion of proceeds in a public offering of 5 and 10-year senior notes primarily to refinance nearer-term obligations. These transactions significantly extended our debt maturities while lowering our weighted average pretax cost of debt to 3.3%. We continue to focus capital allocation on share repurchase. Our total payout ratio was 121% of adjusted income. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased $6.9 million shares at an average cost of $77 per share, totaling $535 million. At quarter's end, there were 235.2 million shares outstanding and 12.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. As I said upfront, sales in the quarter were up 10% over the prior year, 11% sequentially and were 85% of quota. We saw strong pipeline growth in the quarter across the company, including several of the areas we discussed in detail at Investor Day. We expect strong sales performance in the second half of the year. Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, which puts us over our $950 million 5-year program goal about 6 months earlier than we originally anticipated. Our continuing strong performance speaks to the value of our integrated solutions combined with compelling market opportunity. We've recorded $111 million of integrated sales through June or 44% of our full year target. We've also realized $27 million of Operational Effectiveness savings to date, in line with our goals for the year. Going forward, we remain bullish on the opportunity to enhance our infrastructure through projects such as the data center and real estate consolidation in Atlanta, which is our largest domestic market area. We are pleased with our progress and anticipate completion in Q4. As we shared at Investor Day, the FI market remains stable. We continue to work with clients to leverage opportunities arising from the eventuality of interest rate gains, new sources of noninterest income and enhanced operational efficiency. Both financial institutions and merchants are marching cautiously towards compliance for the October EMV liability shift date and there continues to be a heightened level of discussion on faster payments. As I mentioned upfront, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, which includes another step up in internal revenue growth. Internal revenue growth for the full year is still expected to be 5% to 6%, and as I shared at Investor Day, will likely move towards 5%, primarily due to slower than anticipated EMV adoption and negative foreign currency impacts. We still expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be 11% to 14% or $3.73 to $3.83, with a bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. For modeling purposes, we expect much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of EMV and license revenue, prior year comparisons and revenue impact from new client implementations. We're pleased with our results through June and fully expect to deliver on our full year financial expectations. We are executing well in our existing businesses and making strong progress with innovation-based growth. When taken together, we believe this will contribute to further acceleration of our internal revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. This only happens as a result of the incredible contributions of our 21,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly each day to deliver quality, service and innovation to our clients. With that, Tory, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mr. David Togut, calling from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Jeff, you called out much stronger revenue growth expectation for the fourth quarter this year. I gather that's from some of the DNA implementations that are coming onstream. Can you dimension for us, for example, what the 11 implementation means for the back half of the year and additional implementations you might be seeing coming onstream in Q3 and Q4? Jeffery Yabuki : So we had said that we plan to double the number of implementations for the year, which would put us in the 25 to 30 range for the full year. We did 15 last year, we're 11 to date, so obviously, we're picking up some of the revenue from those 11. But we expect to continue -- so for those 11, we'll get, call it in the range of somewhere between 6 and 8 months on average. But we'll also get revenue from each of the remaining implementations that go live in the second half of the year. And that's both in DNA, as well as all of the surround solutions that go with it. We've been fortunate that a large majority of the clients who have selected DNA have also selected a broad suite of our solution to go along with that. In addition to that, to DNA, we also have, as you will remember from our last couple of investor days, talked about the large -- the progress that we made in the large -- primarily in the large bank space, and so a number of those clients we also anticipate going live in this year. So we're starting to get the benefit from, again, the account processing platform revenue as well as the surround revenue that goes with them as well. David Togut : Putting that altogether, should we expect the Financial segment revenue growth to exit the year closer to mid-single digits, closing some of the gap we see with payments which has been by far the faster growing segment this year? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, David, we're going to continue to see acceleration in both segments in the second half of the year. So yes, I mean, clearly, the segment is impacted by license revenue and different sorts of things like that but we are clearly going to have an acceleration as we look into '16 in the Financial segment in the back half of this year. Jeffery Yabuki : And we would also expect to see continuing acceleration in the Payments segment. We're going to expect to see them both accelerate as we exit 2015. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. And, David, to your kind of point on both of the segments, I think, the other thing that Jeff highlighted, he talked about the core processing segment. But in the second half of the year, we clearly have -- the Biller headwinds that we've been talking about in the first half of the year and that business continues to do very well from a transaction growth and a new sales standpoint, so we expect a very strong second half in our Biller business. Clearly, I highlight on the call also that our Output Solutions business, which includes EMV, was fairly flat compared to the prior year in first 6 months of the year. And again, we expect good revenue acceleration in both the base business in that Output Solutions business and also with EMV. And then, in the fourth quarter specifically, some stronger license sales in regards to that, which is usual, but it's going to be a little bit more heavy this year. So those are some of the things that give us good visibility and confidence as we look into the second half of the year. David Togut : Got it. And then, a quick final question. Any thoughts, Jeff, on PayPal's acquisition of Xoom and possible impact on the P2P space? Jeffery Yabuki : I mean, I thought the Xoom acquisition was a good acquisition. From my vantage point, it looks like a good acquisition for PayPal, being able to leverage not just the large number of accounts that they have in the U.S., but they have a very attractive worldwide footprint. And I think, Xoom has built a nice revenue model, but a good technology platform that will be likely valuable for them as they continue to move forward. I see it to be interesting but not that impactful, again, from my vantage point, to P2P more directly, but I do see it to be valuable within the PayPal network. But more importantly, creating a much larger visibility to a cross-border capability that a lot of digital users don't have access to today. David Togut : Understood. And Tom, I appreciate the June 30 share count as well. Thomas Hirsch : Sure, David. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : I guess, I'll just build on the last question, but just sort of I want to understand a little bit better the visibility to the back half organic growth acceleration, meaning, your 4% year-to-date sort of implies at least 6% kind of in the back half and your commentary on the fourth quarter suggests it might even be higher than that in the fourth quarter, so maybe 7%. But is it -- do you have the visibility just based on the DNA conversion, some of the large bank account conversions and some of the headwinds, whether it's the Biller headwinds or the output headwinds just sort of abating? I guess, what I'm getting at is how much incremental new books of business do you need to sign? Or is it just a function of really the conversions just happening as you planned? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Glenn, there's always going to be -- even though, as you know, the substantial majority of our revenue is recurring, I think we said at Investor Day, it's in the 80 -- last year was about 86%, we still have to always continue to sign business. And as you know, revenue -- a few million dollars of revenue can impact your growth rate in any quarter. From our perspective, we have a pretty darn good visibility to the big chunks of revenue that we need to deliver in the second half of the year. And as we commented on, we think it will bias even further to the fourth quarter. The big blocks of revenue, as Tom talked about, just to reiterate, are the revenue that's coming from the conversions, DNA is the one that we talked about a lot but we have DNA and our Signature platform. Frankly, we've got good size clients coming in there that will spread across both of the segments. The second area is in our Biller business, as Tom referenced again, it's growing quite well. And we also have the benefit of some headwinds that have now abated as we've crossed the threshold of the middle of this year. And so we get the combined benefit of better compare and some nice growth. The third area is really around our Output Solutions business which is responsible for EMV. We talked about the size of our production book which is quite strong. It's really a matter of when are the banks going to take delivery of the product, when are they going to be ready for it? We've indicated that it's slipped based on what our internal expectations were at the beginning of the year. It's not a demand item at all. In fact, I think, demand is probably in better shape than we would have anticipated it to be holistically but the timing of the revenues has been slipping, that's why we believe we're going to have a pretty nice boost and likely going to be biased into the fourth quarter. And then, the last thing is around license revenue. We do expect to see more license revenue based on what we can see in the pipe coming in, in the fourth quarter this year. And we also had -- we had a little bit of a tougher compare in the third quarter, that's why that growth will look a little bit stronger in Q4. So overall, we have pretty good visibility to those numbers. We have actually good, strong -- good, solid, I'll say, visibility into how that will translate -- that exit rate will translate into growth into next year, like we talked about at Investor Day, we have a pretty high level of confidence that we'll be able to grow 50 -- add that 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2016. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then, similar question on the margin side. And Tom, you sort of -- I think, were prepared for this. But up 140 basis points year-to-date and the guide is for greater than 50 basis points, is there any sort of incremental investment in the back half, or is it just the function of sort of somewhat of a tougher comp? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, Glenn, I would say, obviously, we're very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year on the margin side. It was ahead of our internal expectations. Really better performance and some timing. That said, we clearly expect to exceed 50 basis points of margin expansion for the year given where we are in the first half. But we do, as you mentioned, we face some more difficult comparisons in the second half mainly around '14 because the second half was about 100 basis points higher than the first half of '14. So -- but there's nothing else unusual going on there. We're going to continue to deliver good margin performance, but we do have some tougher comps and we're we'll clearly exceed 50 basis points for the year. Jeffery Yabuki : Glenn, the other thing I would add to that is when you heard in our prepared remarks that we talked about that we now expect -- that on our adjusted EPS for the year, that we now have a bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year. I think that really begins to reflect the fact that our margin, as we talked about, will absolutely be greater than the 50 basis points. And we think we've picked that up there. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I have a question on -- you mentioned another bank in Georgia taking up -- a relatively larger asset sized bank taking on the DNA platform. Can you speak a little more to the opportunity there for DNA kind of upmarket at the larger asset sized banks? Is the pipeline there growing? Are you seeing incremental interest deploying that solution in a segment of banks that maybe you didn't intend to -- factor on to begin with? Mark Ernst : Ramsey, this is Mark Ernst, let me take that. The reference was to Georgia's Own which is a credit union. And we've had great success with DNA with the credit union market in general and continue to have a strong pipeline in the credit union market. I think, your question really goes to the topic that we kind of covered at Investor Day, which was that one of the things that's been surprising -- a bit surprising to us pleasantly with DNA is that, that technology is kind of opening doors for us in larger -- the larger bank market for some banks that are looking for that kind of technology. So we've got a nice, solid pipeline of institutions that are looking at that as a possibility. Now clearly, the sales cycle on some those transactions is a bit longer because of the size of the institution, but yes -- no, we clearly see that in our pipelines. Jeffery Yabuki : And Ramsey, I would add -- the only thing I would add to that is, as Mark referenced, at Investor Day we did talk about our happiness with how we're doing with DNA in the larger bank space. That was an area that we had not anticipated, specifically in the large in-house realtime market. And that there are several opportunities that we're working on and involved in. And the beauty of that is we are competing against platforms that, frankly, not just some of the domestic platforms but some of the platforms outside the U.S. And it will -- the more swings we get at the plate, the more likely it is that we're going to begin penetrating that space. And frankly, as we begin penetrating that space, we have a pretty high degree of confidence that the combination of that technology with our surround solutions, with our expertise and knowledge of the U.S. banking market, is going to make us quite formidable and turn into some very attractive revenue over the next, call it, the next 2 to 4 years. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. I misheard you, I guess, in your prepared remarks in terms of the size of the bank and whether it was a credit union or not, though. But thanks for those comments, those were helpful. So I wanted to ask you a kind of a longer-term question, it seems like there's a little more buzz these days with cloud-based offerings. Obviously, you guys have Agiliti. I think, Temenos is building something, Fidelity is working on something, I think [indiscernible] has something out there. In the U.S. specifically, do you see any change in the appetite of banks to sort of put their -- smaller banks that you service, to put their core accounting processing kind of in the public cloud? And I guess, the question is sort of if they become more comfortable doing that, does that open up the door to new entrants or competition in a way that you kind of have not seen in the past? And I know it's a relatively long-term question, but just curious on your thoughts there. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, sure. So it's an interesting question that sometimes bounces from conjecture to nomenclature. And what I mean by that is most of us who have been providing outsourced services to banks for years and years would say, we didn't know it but we were basically offering cloud-based services, and we continue to do that. The question of does the utilization of a public cloud make -- allow -- change the barriers to entry in the business, I suspect the people who are trying to get in would say, yes. We would say that at least our belief is that the public cloud as we know it today doesn't have the robustness that would be necessary to support the regulatory environment. Then there are some private cloud utilizations that I think could come in, and we're certainly looking at that as a way to provide the most modern technology solutions possible. But I would say that, yes, it will allow people to talk about being in the market. But the reality is in order to make a solution like that work, you have to win enough clients to get to scale so that the investment makes sense. And it's just -- it's a long, long road to get there. Ultimately, I would not be so bold as to say no one will crack that code. Someone may crack that code and I can tell you that we're looking for what are the best ways to use these emerging technologies to make sure that we have the winning solutions in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : On the DNA activations and customers going live, I think, Jeff, you talked about before, 30 wins coming online. I think you said something in the range of 25 to 30 coming online when you talked about it today. Was there any change in terms of your expectation in terms of anybody pushing off into 2016? Or how should we just think about the confidence level in terms of getting to that 25 versus the 30 number? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Jim, thanks for asking that question. I realized when I was saying it that I was going to look for an opportunity to correct that. I originally said 25 to 30 because I was trying to recall if it was 14 [ph] or 15 [ph], and clearly, it was 15 [ph], and clearly, we plan to bring all 30 online this year. James Schneider : Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I guess, benefit of riches, but in terms of the integrated sales target now that you've met the 5-year goal 6 months early, can you give us some color on how you're thinking about the next 2 years or some other kind of time frame beyond this? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say that right now, we are looking at making sure that we continue to deliver the -- generally the level that we have had over the last several years. And as we get further down the road on some of these newer technology initiatives, whether it be our integrated payment solution or our now network or the next-generation capabilities of Mobiliti, I think, you'll see us likely look to put some new targets out there. But for now, we're going to continue to run at the play -- at the level we're at now, look to build it up. We know that the only way that we can really grow since there are not a lot of new financial institutions in the market is by selling more deeply in. And in fact, one of the things that we're quite focused on is the -- we've traditionally set this up as a way to extend the privileged relationship that exists on the account processing side. One of the comments in our prepared remarks was actually signing a top 40 financial institution to some of our Biller -- a lending client that was referred to our Biller area. So we're really now, over the last 18 months, really been building some muscle in building out that ability to identify good, exciting solutions for us to deliver to our non-account processing solution. And then, also beginning to bring our account processing area into -- or being able to cross over into some of the account processing solutions. A couple of these new DNA solutions that we're out pitching right now to these larger institutions, both of them originated out of relationships that we have in other payments and channel solutions where we have credibility with those clients and therefore, they're looking at us to bring in -- potentially bring in DNA. So we're building a lot of muscle in there regardless of the fact that we haven't set a new program goal. James Schneider : And just a quick housekeeping question. Any moving pieces to think about in terms of term piece for Q3 and Q4? Jeffery Yabuki : No. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I'm just curious about sales cycle. It feels like it's improving. Is that the case? I heard the wins like Synchrony, a lot of good wins on DNA, just curious how the sales cycle is shaping up? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say, Tien-Tsin, that we have continued to have momentum in our results. I would actually say that our first-half sales results were a little bit -- even though they were nice performance against the prior year, they were a little bit lighter in the first half of the year than we would've anticipated at the beginning of the year. Now we see a lot of strength in our pipeline and we're quite bullish about prospects in the second half of the year. But that said, to be a little bit more direct on your question, I would say sales cycles are feeling about the same in terms of duration. I don't see any big changes in there. And I would say that there's a lot of interest in the market to look at things like realtime areas in which we see operational efficiency. And frankly, some of these new products [Audio Gap] are going to drive high-quality fee revenue. We're seeing a lot of interest in those arenas. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. So just to, I guess clarify, maybe build on that, what exactly drove the acceleration on the Payments segment? If you could just rank some of the items? Jeffery Yabuki : You mean in the second quarter? Tien- Tsin Huang : In the second quarter, yes. Thomas Hirsch : Well, it's really kind of continued growth across the board, in 3 or 4 businesses there. Continued acceleration in our card services business, our bill payment business adds some incremental, our channels business, which is our online and mobile business. And then, a little acceleration from our Biller business. But those headwinds in our Biller business are still in there in the second quarter, so those completely go away in the second half, so we're going to continue to see some good ramp. So really good growth across all 4 of those businesses. And I would also say that as I highlighted, the one that has not performed at the level we anticipated at plan was our Output Solutions business. You can kind of see that on our P&L in the product revenue line item. But given EMV and some prior year comparison to base business, that business was flattish. So again, we continue to have good momentum in those other businesses as we head into the second half and we should see much improved performance in our output business in the second half. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. Understood. Just one more if you don't mind. Just the United Way win, I always thought that was a cool one because it fits pretty well with your -- the NOW Network. But I'm just trying to understand a little bit better the integration that's required on the United Way side, do you work with acquirers to turn Popmoney on as a, I guess, I call it a payment tender? I'm just trying to understand how it's scaled using United Way as the case study, if that makes sense? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it's a good question. So we work directly with United Way to integrate -- we see -- one of the interesting use cases we see with Popmoney is we think about it simplistically as a disbursement use case, so allowing us to basically allow a consumer or a business to move money to another consumer or business. And so it feels a little bit more -- mechanically, it feels a little bit more like an ACH as opposed -- an ACH receipt as opposed to taking it through an acquirer on a point-of-sale basis. So they'll have that payment capability up. Now we will -- we are going to have to get it integrated into our bank partners. We'll have it available on the public site but it will take about 6 months to get it fully integrated into our -- the actual bank-based product. But we have a lot of -- we think it's going to not just drive transaction volume but we like the visibility aspect of it out, kind of the billboarding aspect of it quite a bit. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : And just a couple of questions on cash. First of all, with the refinancing, you ended the quarter with $530 million of cash, which usually you end around $300 million. And I'm just wondering, with that extra cash a little more than normal, I mean, do you expect to deploy that and bring it back down to $300 million through repurchases or anything else kind of over the next quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, we're -- Dave, obviously, we're going to redeploy that cash to enhance shareholder value and we have a number of means to be able to do that. But as you know, our debt ratio right now, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at the lower end of our range. So again, we have a number of options with that cash that's sitting on our balance sheet at June 30, but we're going to continue to redeploy that to build shareholder value. David Koning : Okay. Great. And then, the second one, I was just looking back at CapEx, and from '08 to 2012, every year, it was kind of $200 million or a little less than that even on a full year basis. This quarter, it was $113 million just for the quarter, and it looks like over the last couple of years, it's trended up a bit. I guess, I'm just wondering what's behind that? Is that kind of investments into Open Solutions, or what else? And should this higher level be sustainable? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, and Dave, just so you know, we have about $50 million, it's in our footnote that's in there, in CapEx associated with our Alpharetta, primarily leasehold improvements, that's our largest domestic location we have. So we're consolidating, just from a real estate standpoint, about 10 locations into 1 facility. We're also consolidating 2 of our larger data centers into our data center infrastructure. But Dave, we incurred about $50 million of leasehold improvements in that CapEx number through the first 6 months. And so that's what's driving that. We're going to continue to be at 5% to 6% of revenues on an ongoing basis. This is one of those things that's going to occur largely very infrequently just because of the fact it's our largest domestic location. And again, they're leasehold improvements. So when you take that out, we're going to be at the 5% to 6% range. And most of our investment, as you know, really goes through our P&L from a standpoint of development dollars, et cetera. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Darrin Peller from Barclays. Darrin Peller : Look, I just want to hone in for a minute on the margin again. I know you mentioned the mix before, but I mean, obviously, 190 basis points is a pretty substantial increase in the Payments side in particular. And I guess, number one, and just make sure there's nothing unusual there like a term fee or anything else that may have lifted that, and if not, maybe just talk about the sustainability to that kind of expansion given if this is all about mix and operating leverage, I mean, it's obviously a great sign for the future. So maybe the key parts of your Payments business that have such a high level of operating leverage versus the other parts that may not, I think, that'd be a great understanding. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, Darrin, we appreciate that question. And again, we're really pleased with our overall margins. And I would say that, clearly, in our Payments businesses, inside that particular segment, our card business, our bill payment business and also in our Biller business, we're at scale in those particular areas and continue to really have very good operating leverage and very focused on that, very focused on bringing in high-quality revenue. I would say, outside of that, our output business clearly doesn't have that same type of margin dynamic from a long-term standpoint. And that's probably the business in there that can move around with EMV. As we kind of talked about, as Mark kind of highlighted on Investor Day, we don't see it having a big impact, but that can kind of move around as that revenue kind of goes around. But we feel good about our margin performance. Clearly, it was above our expectations in the first half of the year, but we're going to continue to focus on driving high-quality revenue and we'll continue our strategy as we've laid out. Mark Ernst : And Darrin, the only thing I would add to that is to say, as we've talked about a number of times, we have a mix of super scaled solutions, bill payment and debit, we have a lot of solutions in that segment which are growing into themselves and it will be a long time until they scale. And I only bring that up because we do believe that, that is one of the big points of validation on why we believe we'll be able to continue to grow the margin at the level that we've talked about. I don't believe that we'll be able to grow it at 190 basis points on a continuing basis. But there is a lot of runway just by the very nature of these systems which are big scale systems, you put a lot of money into them upfront and then the revenue comes on slowly over time and it flows through nicely. Darrin Peller : That's good to see. I mean, I guess, looking into next year, are there any other big investments needed to keep up pace with the size and scale you're turning into? Thomas Hirsch : Darrin, I would say there continues to be things, clearly, as Jeff highlighted, right? And if you look at our Investor Day, a lot of those initiatives are inside of our Payments segment, whether they be IPS or now, we're going to continue to invest in our mobile strategy, which is a big part and continue to invest in there and in online. And again, clearly, our performance was very strong in the first half of the year. We're going to continue to make the necessary investments that we need to make to continue to grow our top line over the longer term and we'll continue to do that. But we clearly have some good scale businesses in our Payments segment, and that should continue as long as those businesses continue to grow at the levels they are. Mark Ernst : The other thing I would add is that we always talk about our operational efficiency measures or metrics and initiatives, and a lot of those are paying off for us and there's no reason to think they won't continue to work for us. Darrin Peller : Sure. All right. That's helpful, guys. Just one last quick one. I mean, in terms of the items that you -- it was helpful before. I think, Jeff, when you talked through all the items that are going to help for acceleration in the second half and into next year, but just to remind us, sort of the unusual items that had the impact as a headwind in this current year, which has abated [ph], can you just remind us of those couple of items again? I mean, whether it's the term fees or it's certain contracts that moved away or whatever? But obviously, that abates into next year and that helps acceleration also. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think, Darrin, I'll take a couple and I'll turn it over to Jeff. I mean, clearly, in the current year, we're having a currency impact, right, that's higher than what we anticipated. So when you look at our 4% growth in the second quarter, right, it would've been 5% on a constant currency basis. So we clearly have a headwind. It was roughly 60 basis points in the second quarter. That's something that was out there. We talked a little bit about the Biller business and some headwinds there in the first half of the year, which are dissipating clearly as we get into the second half of the year. And we did also talk a little bit about output in the first half of the year given the fact that we had a tough compare. And those are probably the 3 that I kind of see from kind of things that are out there from just a headwind that as we look out into future, we continue to believe that some of those will clearly go away. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Appreciate the insight into the drivers of growth acceleration, because I know investors are keenly interested there. You mentioned, I think, Jeff, a 40% increase in realtime payment transactions in the quarter, maybe 50% in the first half, if I caught that correctly. Jeffery Yabuki : That's right. Andrew Jeffrey : Can you talk a little bit about at what point you think it's reasonable for us to expect that realtime, in the context of mobile in particular, where I know you've made a push with your Mobiliti suite, will start to move the needle in payments. Can we consider that as a '16 event or is that overly optimistic? Jeffery Yabuki : So that's a great question. We think about that all the time. I think, we will start to see -- I think we will see the seeds in '16 in terms of beginning to create somewhat of a tailwind. But I don't think we're going to see the real growth benefits start to lay in until '17. And I do think that it will be a bit of a wave. Once it starts, it will be very, very difficult to stop it. I think we will grow rapidly. And I think the clients will become attached to that kind of a service delivery, whether it is realtime credit of a deposit or to being able to send money to a family member immediately or even paying a bill as if they were at a Biller website. So as I think about it, I really do think we'll see some level of growth in '16, but the real measurability will be in '17. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And it sounds like you remain pretty confident that customers will indeed pay for those functions in the context of what is currently a free P2P environment [indiscernible]? Jeffery Yabuki : That's right. But remember, P2P, in fact, P2P would be the smallest of the near-term use cases that we would see for that. We would see -- I would see bill payment -- kind of the RXP-based bill payment service where we have 1.4 billion or 1.5 billion transactions a year. It doesn't take a very high percentage of those transactions to really move the needle on realtime. I see realtime deposit, realtime mobile deposit being a very interesting use case where today, there are many, many banks in the U.S. who are charging relatively nominal amounts, anywhere from $0.25 to $1 per deposit or per item depending on the institution to use those remote mobile deposit capabilities, and I think there's an opportunity there. And then, of course, I do see P2P and then I see B2B as another very intriguing use case. So yes, I am bullish on that. I'll tell you what, if you asked me where my nervousness is, it's not on the transactions, it's on the price per transaction. And the nervousness is only not -- if there's 1 billion transactions at a relatively small amount, or 100 million transactions at a relatively large amount, it's still going to create a very interesting, scalable opportunity for us, but more importantly, for the financial institutions that offer that service. So I do think -- I think there are a number of ways that use case will come together and we're really excited about it over the next several years. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And a quick one for you, Tom. You've done a great job on working capital management, another good quarter. How much more room do you have to improve cash flows from that particular source? Thomas Hirsch : I think, on the working capital side, clearly, we have a relentless focus internally around continuing to improve that. But clearly, we've done a lot out of that. But we -- our business model, as you well know, our free cash flow per share has been very consistent above our adjusted EPS, probably running at 10% plus a year over the last 5 years pretty consistently. So while we continue to manage and improve working capital, do I think that there's a lot there? No. Do I think we'll continue to manage that tightly? Absolutely. And so that's how I would kind of hone in on that question. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Jeff, just wanted to see if I could get your outlook on the business. Maybe what outperformed so far year-to-date better than your expectations? And then, what kind of underperformed that needs to be fixed as you kind of look into [indiscernible] '16? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, thanks, Brian. I would say that most of the businesses are performing well. As I've mentioned, we are right on top of our internal expectations for the year. The area -- really, the big area that we talked about of underperformance would be impact from foreign currency, which is greater than we anticipated it to be. And because we don't issue our numbers on a constant currency basis, we haven't had that benefit. And then, really, in our Output Solutions, and there's a twofold impact there. The first one is that EMV, while we've had a very large demand and future orders logged, we have not seen the level of production that we had anticipated earlier in the year. That's a matter of timing. The other thing that is intricately connected to that is there were -- because of the large number of breaches last year, we had a lot of reissue. And we're finding institutions trying to balance out how do I think about last year's big reissues with the EMV this year? And we're not seeing the number of programs come through that we typically would have, and we believe that's solely related to the -- these blips and breach timing from last year. So those are the things that we hadn't anticipated. But on balance, we feel like we're making good progress. In that we're well-positioned for the second half acceleration that we had planned originally. Bryan Keane : Okay. Helpful. And then, the other question I had is on acquisitions and the acquisition environment. What do you see out there in terms of valuations or attractive properties right now in the marketplace? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Thanks, Brian. So we've been pretty disciplined on how we think about our capital and how we allocate that capital. There are a lot of attractive properties out there, lots of payments properties that are out there. But valuations are high, and on that basis, when we think about acquisitions, we want to make sure that we're doing things that are strategic, that are going to be accretive to the value that we deliver to our clients as well as our internal revenue growth rate and that they're going to generate sustainable and attractive streams of free cash flow. So we evaluate lots of things, we don't pull the trigger that much and I think we'll continue to be wired in that way. Operator : Our last question comes from Mr. Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Just one question. We talked a little bit about Agiliti in the U.K. challenger banks. Can you give us an update on that? From Investor Day, that was something that piqued my interest and it seems like there might be a bigger pot of gold at the end of that rainbow than maybe we thought originally. How is that progressing? And what's your kind of take so far in the last few months? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, thanks, Brett. It's progressing well. We continue to add new names into our pipeline. We continue to build like crazy. We are doing a lot of work to get built. And we expect to go live with our first client towards the end of Q4, beginning of Q1. We expect to sign at least a couple of clients in this quarter. And I think, you'll continue to see us start to announce some names moving forward. We've been pretty circumspect with the new clients to make sure that we can absolutely deliver on what the clients need when they need it. We think it's really important that these new challenger banks get started in the right way. But the thing that's really been different, Brett, than we had originally anticipated is there are lots and lots of names in our pipeline that are not challenger bank names, and that's what's makes this opportunity much larger than we anticipated, and that is working quite well. And we're -- again, I hate to keep saying this, but we're really bullish on that opportunity as well. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your support. If you have any questions, please give us a call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results are consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day. Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first 9 months of the year due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy and through September 30, had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders. Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year. Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are : first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5% with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenue, such as account processing, payments, including card services, lending and biller solutions, all performed well. For reference, our reported results included negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date. Growing revenue in areas where we have operating leverage, along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle, led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments. Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continue to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter. With over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen a more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30. We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that First Hawaiian Bank with $18.7 billion in assets selected a full suite of digital banking, payments and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership. At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions and billers. During the quarter, PNC, the eighth largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that. This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business-to-consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach. 7 DNA clients went live in the quarter, and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that 6 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank with $4.6 billion of assets; and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client forum. This solution enables debit card holders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive with CardValet users adding an average of 5 incremental debit transactions per month. On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to new revenue over the short and mid-term. We're also excited about our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions tools to allow consumers real time access to deposited funds across branch, ATM and mobile channels. This is another example of a Fiserv solution, which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients. EMV continued to progress in the quarter with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufactures and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has picked up, we only recognized about 10% or $1 million of the incremental EMV revenue generated in the quarter. The remaining $9 million will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect to see incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016. Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong, and we expect additional signings before the end of the year. Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year to $1.03. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue this quarter, offset by a decline in product revenue, due primarily to lower card reissuance revenue in Output Solutions. Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our Operational Effectiveness programs. Now on to the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and biller businesses led the segment performance. While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods to the cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter end but not yet personalized. We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market. Our integrated debit value proposition, along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and CardFree Cash is resonating well with the market. Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and we saw good traction in value-added services, such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. Mobile users continue to grow as we approach 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see even more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues. Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7% and through September, is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale, recurring revenue businesses and cost efficiencies. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue, partially offset by currency. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year-to-date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas, such as account processing and lending, higher one-time fees and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency. Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year-to-date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%. Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year-to-date to $2.77. Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion or 2.3x, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned upfront, sales in the quarter were 86% of quota. Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters. Pipelines are solid across the board, including good traction with our newer solutions. We expect to finish our sales year strong, leading to excellent momentum going into '16. Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions, such as debit and credit services, Mobiliti, bill payment, Source Capture and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year. Operational Effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year-to-date. In addition to solid end year performance, we are building the foundation to achieve the new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day. We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta Campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated 2 of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings. Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels, which we expect will continue. While regulatory and efficiency remain in focus, we are starting to see early movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focused solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of real time, digital and evolving consumer expectations. As I mentioned upfront, we are well positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016. We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue growth for Fiserv into the future. We know our success is dependent on more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day. Speaking of talented associates, earlier today, we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years at Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available, as needed, after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition. Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future. On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidant and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door and when he closes the ledger for the last time, he will be missed. With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition, and we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31. With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And now our first question is coming from Mr. Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer & Co. Glenn Greene : Tom, sorry to see that you're leaving. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Glenn. Glenn Greene : Yes. I guess the first question would be maybe, Jeff, if you could give us a little bit more in terms of the environment and the sales outlook. It sounds like the sales was okay in the quarter, not great, maybe a few deals were pushed out. Maybe just more about the -- from a bigger picture perspective, the sales environment not only into the fourth quarter but heading into 2016, and then I got a follow-up. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Glenn. And I would say that while sales were a little bit lower than obviously 100% in the quarter, We've had 2 really great years in a row, kind of 2 record years. And I think to some extent, we are focused on transitioning from a lot of the things that we've sold historically. We had a big burst of energy, right, as we brought DNA in; we're in the midst of bringing those live and we're getting some very strong traction with some of the newer solutions that I talked about today, whether it be Popmoney for disbursements or Immediate Funds, CardValet, a number of different products. So while the first few quarters have been a little bit light, we expect quite a strong fourth quarter. We typically have had larger deals in the middle of the year. This year, those deals have been a bit bifurcated. We had a little bit early. We expect to see several of them late, and we feel very good about our pipeline and the momentum going into next year across -- really across the entire company. Glenn Greene : And then could you just remind us where you are on the conversion pipeline both for DNA and the account processing pipeline? And it sounds like you're going to complete 30 of the DNAs this year. Is there -- what's the balance going into '16? And then just an update on the account processing pipeline, too -- conversion pipeline. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, absolutely. I would say that still, the majority of our larger deals have not yet been converted in this year. I mentioned that we've got 6, $1 billion-plus institutions going live on DNA alone in the fourth quarter. We haven't given any visibility yet into what next year's conversion cycle looks like. We'll give a little bit more visibility into that when we get into February when we give guidance next year. But we're making good progress. We -- our biggest clients, I mentioned Washington Federal, which is our largest DNA conversion, that'll go live in the fourth quarter. So much of that revenue will start to show up in Q4 and then turn into next year. And across the rest of our platforms, most of our larger conversions are going into next year. So we will not have benefited from them in 2014 -- 2015, I'm sorry. Glenn Greene : Okay. So you still have the comfort and visibility to think that organic growth will further accelerate in '16? Jeffery Yabuki : Absolutely. I mean, we stand very clearly by our conversation at Investor Day. We're going to see -- we're going to exit the year as we said at approximately 6% and we expect to have that be a good foundation for our growth going into next year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the margins and the sustainability of them. Obviously, some good upside and I guess some one-time items in the quarter. But can you maybe talk about what really drove that upside? Was that purely the incremental margin contribution from the Payments side business? Or are there also some kind of ongoing benefits from data center consolidation that were in there in the quarter? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, it's a great question, Jim. And I think our margins -- we are very disciplined with what we do. We clearly have some benefit from our Operational Effectiveness initiatives and just general cost efficiencies. I think, again, combined with really high-quality revenue, a lot of our revenue growth again is coming in our card services or our biller business, where the incremental margins of those particular solutions are fairly high. So you can see on the cost dynamic, that our costs -- overall costs have increased this year, year-to-date, about 2% only. And again, we have a lot of factors that contributed to that high-quality revenue. We have a scalable model and our Operational Effectiveness including, as Jeff talked about our -- some of our data center consolidations, which are actually going to have a greater impact as we look out over the next several years. So we continue to be confident and continually margin expansion over the next several years as we kind of going into our next phase of Operational Effectiveness. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then maybe one for Jeff. Just to follow up on the sales question, can you maybe talk about the types of deals that pushed out into Q4 or into 2016? Were those mainly on the core processing or DNA side or were there more ancillary things like bill pay and Popmoney? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, they tend -- the deals that you manage from a slippage perspective tend to be the larger, broad solution, kind of multiple solution deals so they biased -- they did bias to the account processing, the core processing side. We had a couple of other deals slip in the lending side, but it's really on the account processing pieces of the business. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : I'm not sure whether or not to congratulate you, Tom, but you'll certainly be missed. Thomas Hirsch : Okay. Thanks, David. I appreciate that. Jeffery Yabuki : David, we're going to go for congratulations. David Togut : Okay. Well, definitely a bittersweet moment. Thomas Hirsch : Yes. David Togut : I had a question on DNA. I know with the previous generation product acumen, one of the challenges you faced was much longer-than-expected conversion time line. What are you finding on these big DNA wins in terms of time line to convert versus your expectations? Jeffery Yabuki : Now that's a very good question, David. We are actually very, very happy with the implementation work that's happened with DNA, especially given that this is -- was new to the family just in early '13. And we have meaningfully ramped up their implementations. I would guess that we'll do more implementations in the fourth quarter than that business did in the prior 12 to 18 months. So we have ramped it up nicely. And we are finding to the extent that there are any issues and there have been very few, but if there are any issues, they are not coming from us. They're coming on the client side. And these have also tended to be larger, multiple product implementations. Again, so they've got a level of complexity, and the team has dealt with them beautifully. Most of the clients are referenceable, if not on day 1, on day 3 or 4. So we're feeling very good about the implementations to date, and that's one of the reasons why we have great momentum in the market. David Togut : Great. And then do you have any data on attach rates? You've highlighted your surround strategy with DNA. Any data on attach rates for products like payments and so forth? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say that we're seeing at or better than what we've seen across the enterprise. If you remember, when we acquired Open Solutions, one of our strategic hypotheses was that because Open didn't have the value of the surround set, that there was something that had been missing from that value proposition as we brought it in, as we shared on our Investor Day, we've been very happy with the level of both sales within the new DNA win since we've acquired it, but even more important, have been the ability to penetrate the existing base. So we're not going to give that data right now, but I would say we remain as optimistic and with the same level of conviction as when we talked in June and when we talked prior to that. David Togut : Your class savings appear to be running ahead of plan. As we see these big implementations of DNA, should we expect the operating leverage of the business to improve even further? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, so I would separate, the cost savings from the point of operating leverage, primarily when we're talking about operating leverage, we'd be talking about the ability to add new revenue to our scaled businesses at a pretty low incremental margin -- I'm sorry, pretty low incremental cost to very high incremental margin. And at the same time, at some point, we will likely be able to reduce the size of our implementation team within DNA. But frankly, that's the last thing we want to do. I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of Operational Effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our dispersed data centers, and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our dispersed workforce. So those are the big 3 ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million. Remember also in our Operational Effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter, right? And so we had a very good quarter this year, I think we're just about $5 million to $6 million away from our target for the year. Hopefully, we'll stay ahead of that as we can, but we continue to build that muscle and we feel good about our ability for the next few years to use that to create supplemental margin moving forward. David Togut : Got it. Just 2 quick housekeeping questions. Can you give the debit volume growth in the third quarter? And then if you could call out the termination fees that standalone outside of the software license fees and what the year-over-year compare is? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, David, I think the -- I don't have that in front of me. But the year-to-date is around 10%. I think in the third quarter, it's somewhere in the high single digits for debit, exactly. And roughly around 10%, I believe, on a year-to-date basis. Again, good growth in that particular area. Regarding the termination fees, I know, David, as you well know, right, it's kind of the normal part of our business and they vary period to period. The combined license and termination fees were up about $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year. To your question specifically, termination fees overall were up by approximately $10 million year-to-date and for the quarter. This was offset, however, by a decrease of about $5 million in license fees year-to-date and for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had negative currency impact in the quarter of about $8 million and $20 million on a year-to-date basis, which more than offset those increases. And as Jeff highlighted, we had to defer about $9 million of EMV revenue in the quarter due to the fact that we've completed the manufacturing element. But have not personalized the cards, which is a smaller part of that, which will happen. And so with that, that's the numbers on the termination fee side. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : Congrats, Tom. A ton of good quarters in the last 10 years, for sure. And I guess my first question, the EBIT growth, just I guess on an organic basis you could say, it was about the strongest it's been in probably the last 8 years or so, maybe even longer. And so I know you isolated high-quality revenue and some cost initiatives and stuff. But I mean, it was so strong relative to kind of the last several years that -- is it more on the just high-quality revenue? And maybe what's changing compared to the last several quarters? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I think, Dave, I don't always look at one quarter, right? There's always puts and takes in every quarter. But if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, right, our operating income is up 9%, which is very strong. Our expense base is up a couple of percent. And I think it's a combination of all those factors that we've been really focused on. And there's not one thing, as you well know, that drives us from a result standpoint. It's a combination of all the things that you talked about, right? It's the revenue mix of high-quality revenue, it's the Operational Effectiveness areas that we're making good improvement on. Selling the right things that are dropping that through and just continue to focus this organization on continuing to be more efficient across the board. So again, there's not really 1 or 2 things that stand out. It really is when you look back out at it, the overall business model, and just making sure that our teams are executing that business model as well as we possibly can. Jeffery Yabuki : Dave, I'd just add one thing. I mean, to your point of this notion we talk a lot about high-quality revenue. And in the quarter, we had lots of different discrete benefits, high-quality revenue, Mobiliti, Mobiliti users, some onetime revenue. We're able to offset some smaller term fees -- I'm sorry, smaller license revenue. You have all kinds of things going on. I guess the only point I would make is because of how we've shaped the model, whether that revenue comes in through a Mobiliti user or it comes in from a one -- kind of a onetime or occasional revenue, the drop throughs are going to get better and better because of how we're managing the cost base overall. And that -- we like that because obviously, it gives us the margin and some business model expense leverage, but it also gives us the ability to invest at times where there are opportunities for us to invest. And so we -- as you know, we're committed to raising margins 50 to 100 basis points a year. And when things are going a little bit better, we'll look for ways to invest to take advantage of those where the perfect storm comes in our favor. David Koning : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then I also looked at -- it looks like your guidance is for EPS to be down just a bit in Q4 sequentially. And I looked back -- the last time that happened was Q4 2007, it looked like. So I guess is Q4 a quarter where you're going to invest some of that away? Or maybe I think you paid some bonuses a few years ago at different times kind of spend a little extra away. Is that maybe what's happening this year? Jeffery Yabuki : That's a good memory, Dave. Thomas Hirsch : Yes, it is. Jeffery Yabuki : That's a good memory. I think that was Q4 of '07 or Q4 of '08? I think it was an interesting time. Thomas Hirsch : We do have a couple of things going on in the fourth quarter that are going to have those expenses a little bit higher than we had in Q3. [indiscernible] there's a couple of investments there. We do have a couple -- a little bit of business mix. We're also going to experience higher commissions as Jeff indicated earlier on. We're going to have some strong sales results in the fourth quarter. We also have our Fall Forum Client Conference in the fourth quarter. And then last but not least, we are self-directed or self-insured for our health claims, Dave. We're going to have a pretty significant ramp in the fourth quarter this year compared to the other quarters. There's normal seasonality there, but it's going to be much bigger. And so those are all kind of 4 or 5 different events that are kind of impacting our Q4 a little bit higher expense level than we normally would have. And so again, none of these things are really when you look at from a year standpoint, overall, it just kind of the way that things are kind of hitting that quarter. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Andrew Jeffrey : Tom, you certainly will be missed, there's no question about it. Thomas Hirsch : Thank you. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, one of the things you've talked about as one of the sort of overriding themes from a strategic perspective is real-time payments. Could you just step back as you talk about high-quality revenue and the margin improvement you've been enjoying, and certainly, disbursement is an interesting new offering and new functionality. Generally speaking, faster settlement, real-time settlement, is this all part of everything that's going into Fiserv's sort of innovation when I think about Mobiliti Suite and so forth? Or is there a separate call out that we're going to be talking about a year from now or 18 months from now around a real-time payment suite of products? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I mean, I -- we started to talk about that, Andrew, at Investor Day. And we've used a label of now to try to capture this notion of realtime beyond point-of-sale, right? There's a big war that's going on at point-of-sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there, there's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was Immediate Funds, that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging realtime, although certainly, the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a real-time rail to make that payment. And I only set that up as context because the answer is, I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations to talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the real-time space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving that construction into the backend of our real-time payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or Immediate Funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA, I think the example we used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where you have -- a consumer has a credit card account. We see that all as options and ways to help consumers use the real-time networks that are being built right now. I think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built? And so while we are, to some extent, in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there is a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we -- our ambition is to bring that real-time capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know it's a longer -- maybe a longer answer, but that's how we're thinking about it right now. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. So more to come in terms of this theme of really giving your customers or the FIs, the ability to drive more revenue in their businesses. Jeffery Yabuki : Exactly. And we've been planting a lot of those seeds, whether it was through the 2,100, 2,200 Popmoney institutions that we have today, or the 6,000 -- 5,000, 6,000 RXP institutions we have today. And now bringing Mobiliti, right, all kinds of those. So those -- the flags are being planted, right, the rails have to actually get caught up to allow more ubiquity in the backend. Andrew Jeffrey : And then just as a follow-up, with regard to international, are there assets out there that might make sense for Fiserv in terms of the significant step up in international exposure? Is that still something that is central to the long-term growth plans? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I mean, I would say that we have never said that international is essential to our long-term growth plans. What we have said is we see a couple of discrete opportunities, Agiliti is one of them where we can create a boost to our internal revenue growth rate. But at the end of the day, I think we have 6%, 7% of our revenue is international. It's going to be hard even if you're adding 1% of internal revenue growth, it's going to be hard just to call that essential to the company. To date, we have not seen large international acquisitions. I assume that you're asking question around large, that would make sense for our model. Frankly, we have seen so much opportunity in the U.S. right now that, that's where our focus is. We certainly look at some of the assets that become available. But for right now, the majority of the opportunity that we see international beyond the 6% or 7% of revenue that we're focused on today is really trying to make the world smaller, right? So allowing money to move more simply between the U.S. and Australia or the U.S. and India or the U.S. and wherever and back, right? And so looking at different technology solutions that may make that easy so that banks and others can facilitate the global movement of money simply, easily and securely. Operator : Next is coming from Mr. Tien-Tsin Huang. Tien- Tsin Huang : I guess, I want to ask -- build upon Dave's question just on the margin front. I'm curious given that you guys have outperformed year-to-date and I caught the fourth quarter commentary. Have you considered sort of changing your investment sort of philosophy, the discretionary versus nondiscretionary mix, for example? Just as you look forward into 2016 and '17? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I think Tien-Tsin, what we said is that historically, where we have been meaningfully outperforming our margin guidance that to the extent that it makes sense for us and our shareholders and our clients that there are ways that we can further invest and still ensure that we meet our financial commitments, we take a look at that. I think Tom was also talking about some of the timing of expenses that we believe that will hit us in Q4. But that said, one of the things that we've talked about over time is the combination of the revenue model that we're building, and the benefit of the Operational Effectiveness program really gives us more capacity to invest and grow the business or frankly not invest and let it flow through to the bottom line. So we're looking at that all the time quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, month-on-month, depending on what's going on. Now you know well that we don't make large, it's hard for us to decide in a heartbeat to make a big capital investment. Most of our investment is through our P&L. It's linked to labor, so you have to hire people. So you can't make big decisions to change -- I can't make a big decision to change my expense trajectory next week. But you can be sure that we have investments teed up that we have an idea that where it makes sense, that maybe we should deploy money in a different way. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay, understood. That's what I was thinking about longer term because resketching that I know is tough in the short time. Just on that core system conversion side, I wanted to ask a question there. I know there's been a lot of DNA wins, you've had some good wins also like First Hawaiian and, et cetera, including some Corillian stuff. I'm just curious, the year's almost done, have you seen in hindsight here a bigger appetite for conversions, and how does that feel going into next year on the conversion side? Jeffery Yabuki : So we have seen more activity in the larger end of the base in 2015, than we have probably in the last 5 or 6 -- at a minimum in the last 5 or 6 years. We have -- there's more discussion and movement on the real-time core processing side of the house. We are not seeing a lot more activity below that level. We're seeing a lot of competition in that -- in the smaller -- kind of in the $1 billion and below -- in the below space, and so there's a lot of activity there. But we are seeing processes, RFP processes, evaluation processes going on. We've been pleased that we've been involved in that. We've actually been down selected once or twice in pretty big evaluations, which is something that we would not have been able to do frankly had we not acquired DNA. So we are seeing some activity there. I think that'll manifest over time. One of the beauties to that is the institutions that are doing the evaluation tend to know us because they're -- maybe they're a Corillian client, they're very likely a bill pay client. In that space, we've got a number of really important solutions, the PEP+. PEP+ client, so they're using our technologies and so we have a relationship with them. Whether that will ultimately get us over the finish line, we'll see. But we do think it has them give us more consideration than if we were one of the new kids on the block. Tien- Tsin Huang : And, Tom, thanks to you and, obviously, wish you the best. Thomas Hirsch : Thank you. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: On EMV, I'm trying to understand better whether that $10 million in EMV revenues in the quarter -- putting aside for a second the deferral issue that you pointed out, does that represent a material increase versus EMV revenues last quarter? I mean, what I'm trying to get a better sense of is, does this result signal any type of ramp that we're finally sort of seeing this delayed EMV ramp? Or it is just sort of a still kind of business as usual? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, I would say I'll take it first then turn it over to Jeff, Ramsay. I think we are seeing a tick up clearly, right? We didn't have this activity in the first half of the year. And clearly, in the third quarter, it's building as we anticipated right? So we did $10 million of EMV -- incremental EMV manufacturing in the third quarter, which is much more significant than the second. We had to defer $9 million of that to future periods. But as we laid out on kind of Investor Day as Mark laid out, right, this 2015 is going to be the low water point. And it's building nicely as we look out into '16 and '17. And so that's the way I would phrase that. But, Jeff, I don't know if you wanted to add something else to that. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, the way -- probably a little bit more context. So the $9 million that we ended up deferring, we ended up deferring it -- first of all, we had to defer it because it was the first time we had really meaningful EMV activity, but if you think about the $10 million of production for the quarter before the deferral, the 10 x 4 is 40, but that's $40 million in a year. If you go back and look at what we've laid out for Investor Day, I mean, that would have been the start of a very attractive run for us. So the answer is yes. We saw a lot more production. We ended up needing to defer the $9 million of the $10 million, and we believe that, that deferral will stay constant for a while, right? And so if you look through that, we would expect to be able to recognize a more normal amount of revenue moving forward. Ramsey El-Assal: Changing topics here. The clearXchange had a recent change in ownership. It seems like the banks are trying to fuse [ph] it up with some sort of fraud and risk- related assets that they have and potentially maybe focus a little more on the realtime side of things. Does this change the competitive landscape at all for you guys in that space? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it does. Actually, I would say it does more than change the competitive landscape. I think it's quite a positive move for the landscape in general. I mean, Early Warning is famous for having very high-quality risk and analytics and they do a great job. We announced a partnership with them at our Investor Day. We're doing some very interesting work on the realtime side. Now they have not traditionally been in the real-time payment world. They're in the real-time data exchange world, and they're going to build out some capabilities. We're building a nice partnership with them, and we expect this to be quite positive for the industry. Remember, clearXchange is the -- really the backend of the process, where they're enabling some of the engines for those institutions. Those institutions still need front-end applications. A number of those institutions that are in clearXchange, as well as another 2,000, more than 2,000, around the system use our front-end. So I'm hopeful and optimistic that this will move the industry closer to more ubiquity in allowing consumers to move money at the speed of their choice, so we're quite excited about it. Ramsey El-Assal: Sort of a rising tide lifts all boats sort of mentality it sounds like which makes sense. One quick last one for me. On Agiliti in the U.K., is the rollout there still kind of tracking to your expectation? I think you mentioned potentially rolling a customer out there towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year. Is that still sound like a reasonable goal? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we would expect to be live. I would say at this stage because it's taken a little bit longer to get this first contract signed, it's a little bit more difficult when you're building a business from scratch, subject to all of the regulatory approvals and everything else. But I would expect this to go live in the first half of next year with multiple clients. So I'm -- we're really excited about that. Operator : Our next question is coming from George Mihalos of Cowen and Company. Allison Jordan : This is Allison in for George. Tom, let me add my congratulations on your retirement. I just had a quick question within the Financial segment, I'm curious if you can disaggregate a bit what growth trends you're seeing across core processing, item processing and loan servicing businesses. I'm wondering if it's fair to say that the core processing business is growing above total segment revenue growth while the other businesses are below. Thomas Hirsch : I would say in the Financial segment, as you're aware, right, the largest share of our revenue comes from the core processing area, so clearly, that's growing faster than our areas like check processing, which is in decline. So that is correct. I think the other areas that we have in there, lending has been growing nicely. But we have been impacted -- our international businesses in there, so our currency is kind of negatively impacted that segment. And we should, over time, continue to see international contribute to that. But to your point, item processing is a bit of a drag. The core is the big piece of growth that's in that particular area are along with our lending area. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say I mean, just for clarity, that we have both seen some good growth trends coming out of the lending businesses and that we would expect over the next couple of years to see lending itself be an important part of how financial institutions are obviously going to drive revenue. So those trends, we think, will look better moving forward than they have historically, as people have not really been spending in that space. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your attention and support. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact our IR team. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Ma'am, you may begin. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year. These strong results were in spite of Q4 revenue that was a bit light versus expectations, driven primarily by delays in EMV card personalization and lower-than-planned license revenue. Overall, performance in the second half of '15 was solid, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8% and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time. We anticipate strong results again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 to 100 basis points per year. We also expect another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share. As you saw on January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience. In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies, to be right around 5x EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes. At the beginning of the year, we established 3 key priorities to help you assess our performance, which were : first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year was short of our guidance as we could not overcome the revenue delay, resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. But for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%. We saw a good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses, such as card services, biller solutions, digital channels and account processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016. Our second priority was to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. January marked the 3-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful, adding a modern, innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To date, we have signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions. For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, and of the 9, 6 went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year. We added a number of privileged client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S. with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA, along with a suite of integrated solutions to serve its more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world. Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions, including retail and business online, Mobiliti, bill payment, Popmoney and Source Capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology, streamline operations and enhance their clients' experience. In addition to new clients, we remained focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis on our payments and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across card services, bill payment and Popmoney. In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution, which provides value at the intersection of mobile experience and card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP. We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year, which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution, in its inaugural year, added 60 clients in the quarter, and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users. Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted 6 of our innovation- based solutions : Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW and IPS, that, together, form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis intact, and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period. During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network for business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with CARE, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world, to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time. One of our newest in market innovations, Immediate Funds, gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial institutions the option of providing consumers real-time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to Immediate Funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time, right-now solution. Client focus on EMV remains heightened, and activity levels are increasing. Card manufacturing accelerated again this quarter, and backlog is building. We have a much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year. We signed our second client to Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, in the fourth quarter. Camden Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year. In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as the banking platform for the U.K. Credit Union Expansion Project with plans to initially migrate up to 40 U.K. credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year. Finally, we closed a very small biller solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' Convenience Pay Services business. This expands our biller footprint to a modern SaaS platform, enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business will generate roughly 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3x EBITDA. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results. Thomas Hirsch : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays. Our full year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5% excluding the unanticipated impact of these items. Our revenue for the year is a tale of 2 cities as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lowered-than-planned license revenue for the year. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue, which is key to our long-term growth profile. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range, growing 15% to $3.87. Full year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on Operational Effectiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7% with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our fall client conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment, which, by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter. At the segment level, our Payments businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our card services, biller and channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter, and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated. A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015, which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016 as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers. We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continued to grow above market with high single-digit growth for the year. Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continue to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low single digits and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first release supporting our integrated payment strategy, or IPS, which warrants a new integrated bill payment, P2P and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging, as we expect further growth from these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years. As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year, gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transactional services. Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million and, for the year, was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance is driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency even as we continue to invest in targeted innovation. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our account processing and lending businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses, including our fall client conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points, driven by growth in our scale businesses such as account processing and the benefit of our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points. Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016. We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe the combined benefits of focusing on high-quality revenue, along with disciplined capital allocation, will continue to produce excellent free cash flow per share results. We received $36 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2015, which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008, we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to date. Total debt at year end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion but is still only 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced a new 15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year end had 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter. Full year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years, which we expect to reverse in '16. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions, which should bode well for a faster start this year. Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, Mobiliti and custom statements. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization. After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress our real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new 5-year $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million. One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity, which we expect will continue. We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape. There is no question that digital and, specifically, mobile, is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches are in decline and the payment world is more dynamic than ever, which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity. Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years. With that, let's move to 2016. Our 3 key enterprise priorities, which remained generally unchanged, are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our road map for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our scaled, high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that will likely build sequentially. We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year. Lastly, for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year. On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcased the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow. We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well positioned for the foreseeable future. Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow. Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO. And we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter. With that, Laura, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Congratulations on the strong free cash flow growth. Nice to go out on a high note, Tom. Thomas Hirsch : Absolutely, David. David Togut : So just moving into some of the targets, your 2016 Operational Effectiveness target of $40 million is less than what it was in 2015. What are the drivers behind that? Thomas Hirsch : I think, yes, David, we're in the first part of our new program, and so there's a number of different items. So we anticipate that this is going to accelerate on a year-over-year basis. We feel highly confident in that number. We are doing a lot of things, as Jeff indicated in the script, around our real estate and data center consolidation. And most of those impacts, we're doing a lot of the consolidation activities around our data center optimization efforts in '16, which is not going to have the full run rate benefit until largely '17 and '18, and so that's probably the biggest driver in that case because it's a little bit different than the benefits we had in '15, which were focused a lot on procurement. So those benefits are going to scale up as we go through the next few years, along with a  -- continued on the workforce optimization side. But that's really the biggest issue there. David Togut : Understood. And then what is the 2016 sales target? Jeffery Yabuki : In -- David, in terms of gross numbers or... David Togut : Yes. In terms of total new bookings. You mentioned you fell a little short for '15. Jeffery Yabuki : We fell a little short -- we typically don't supply that number, the actual number. But we do expect to have higher sales growth in '16 versus '15, and that'll be reflected in our quota for the year. David Togut : Got it. Okay. And then just one question on your acquisition of the ACI Worldwide digital assets. How should we think about the $50 million tax benefit? Over what period of year -- number of years is that recognized? And is that an income statement item or just a cash flow item? Thomas Hirsch : It's just a cash flow item, David. So that's the discounted value -- or the net present value of those tax benefits over a 15-year period. Jeffery Yabuki : Right. So the $50 million is the NPV, David. So actually, the gross number would be meaningfully larger, but that is the NPV. David Togut : Got it. And then, Tom, final time, what was the December 31 share count? Thomas Hirsch : I actually had that written down on my piece of paper here, David. So we had roughly 225.3 million at the end of December. And at the end of January, we bought back about another 2 million shares in the month of January. Operator : Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could help us understand the dynamic with your clients in terms of them ordering manufacturing -- having you manufacture cards and then sort of delaying the personalization. Is it just a question of they're not turning over their cardholder base in terms of reissuing cards as fast as they had intended? Or what's the dynamic there that is sort of causing a delay? It seems like they're putting one foot in the water but not the other. Mark Ernst : Hey, this is Mark Ernst, so let me take that real quick. Fundamentally, what we're seeing happen with the clients is that they were kind of working on their own internal schedules to get EMV cards ready and out the door. And we just sort of had a bit of a delay in how many of those were finally issued to their consumers. And some of that is a systems readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through with the reissue process. But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process differences by clients but, very importantly, concern over not coming up short on the EMV chip availability. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. That -- it has been a longer lag, Ramsey, than we anticipated, that we normally see, because these clients are actually paying obviously for all of this product and taking title to the cards also. So it has been, to Mark's point, for us, it's been very surprising this year that we'd see that. But obviously, over time, these cards are going to get issued over the next year or 2, and that cycle is going to dramatically reduce, we believe, because they're going to be issuing these cards to their consumers. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That was my next question, and this is probably a rather obvious question. But there's no risk that the deferred revenue never gets implemented, right? These could -- this is sort of like money in the bank in a sense that these plastics will get reissued. It's not like they'll just -- that deferred revenue would need to be adjusted at some point. It's sort of just a matter of when rather than if. Thomas Hirsch : That's correct because they've paid us for these, right? We receive the cash and defer the revenue, and so it's going to get recognized when those cards are ultimately shipped to the end consumer. And that's going to happen. Right. So it's just a matter of timing. And as I think Jeff indicated on his prepared remarks, the -- we look at '16 right now, we see at least initially the middle part of the year to be when a lot of personalization is going to occur, but we continue to watch it closely, and -- but those cards are definitely going to get issued over the next 2 years here. Mark Ernst : And I think even if they weren't issued for some bizarre reason, they've already -- the titles were already transferred, so there's no risk of not recognizing that revenue. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And the chips, actually, have a finite life, so it is -- Ramsey, to your point, it's a little bit of an oddity. I also think the community, primarily, this is a community bank issue, the community banks are making decisions on the timing of their -- should they do a mass reissue, should they do partial reissues, there are a lot of factors. So you saw the FI landscape kind of ignore the issue, and then, all of a sudden, it became very urgent. And then they bought them, and then they had to think about what's the best way to get them distributed. The other thing to keep in mind is the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so we are just really seeing -- and you're probably -- we're all seeing it every once in a while now, finally, a merchant says, \"All right, well, you have to put your card into the machine.\" So that landscape is coming together, and the end-to-end equation is being built. We expect that will continue to build, and that'll match up well with the institutions deciding to send the cards out to their consumers and get them finally personalized. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And last one for Tom, fittingly, the higher expenses in the corporate segment this time around, that was really all -- can you give us a little color on that? That was all basically -- that was relatively transient and should correct going forward? Thomas Hirsch : That's correct. We had a little time and if you look at -- we have about the same level of expenses as we had in the previous 3 quarters this year. We just had a very -- last year's fourth quarter was very, very low, so we had some onetime items there that were more of a benefit. And you're going to see us around -- we had about $100 million for the full year for the corporate and other segment, and that should be pretty much where it's at for the next -- in '16. Operator : Our next question is from David Koning from Baird. David Koning : Yes. And I guess, first of all, it sounds like -- well, I mean with the acquisitions, I guess it sounds like not overly material, but are they in the EPS guidance right now? Jeffery Yabuki : So we had -- as we talked about, we had 2 acquisitions. We had a small biller acquisition, a very, very small biller acquisition, and so that is in our guidance. We believe ACI, the numbers are in our guidance as well. The results -- because of when it will close and how it's going to come on, we think it's going to be fairly immaterial to our numbers. When it closes in the next quarter that we report, we'll give some more insights into that. We also think that the majority of the synergies in this deal will be -- it'll take -- we have to transition the solutions over. These are recurring revenue kinds of solutions that have to move into our data centers, and things like that. So it probably -- we won't see the benefit of the synergies likely until '17. And that's important when we think about how the earnings will effectively come on. David Koning : Yes, great. That makes sense. And then what were term fees in Q4? And do you expect them to be similar in '16 as they were in '15 just given the M&A environment in banks is a little high right now? Thomas Hirsch : Yes. We don't see really any change with that on a year-over-year basis. They were up just I think $1 million or $2 million in the fourth quarter over last year. So about the same, but up slightly, Dave. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer & Co. Glenn Greene : I guess the first question on maybe just a little bit more granularity on the key catalyst to drive the acceleration in the organic growth. I know you talked about it at a high level. It sounds like it's a combination of less drags from FX and EMV, but maybe more of the positives. How much incremental do you expect from Agiliti, Mobiliti, just a little bit of color on the key high-level drivers? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Glenn, let me take it, and then Tom and Mark can add in as needed. So when I think about the drivers of the growth acceleration in '16, you have -- as we laid out at Investor Day, we laid out that we were thinking about our growth in 2 separate baskets : the momentum-based growth, which is really the mass of the company in our kind of existing business portfolio; and then we had 6 solutions that we highlighted as representative of areas of innovation-based growth. We actually talked about 12, but we highlighted 6. And so from each of those 6 areas : Agiliti; DNA; EMV; NOW; Integrated Payments, or IPS; and Mobiliti, we see each of those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in '16. It won't surprise you to know we're not going to talk about it specifically, but on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in '16, even more in '17, even more in '18. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that, that's going to happen. So that's point one. Point two is we expect to have a little less drag from FX. We expect to not be surprised by this lag between EMV card manufacturing and EMV card personalization. So we think that will turn as well. So when you add all those up, it gives us a pretty good degree of confidence and frankly a good degree of visibility into how we get from 2015 into 2016, which we believe will act as a step to 2017. Glenn Greene : Okay. Next question, on the ACI assets. Just to make sure I'm thinking about it right, because I think you suggested 5x EBITDA including synergies. And I assume that's including the tax benefit also. So is it then implying sort of run rate $30 million EBITDA once you've got the synergies fully borne? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Like, listen, that math even I can do. So I would say that's probably a reasonable way to think about it, yes. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then the revenue contribution and how you're going to finance it? Jeffery Yabuki : So I believe we said it's between 1% and 2% of our revenues. And again, we want to wait and see. Number one, we don't have a good sense, we don't have a perfect sense. We think we have a good sense, but not a perfect sense for when it's going to close and therefore how much revenue we're going to bring in this year, which is why we're giving the range. But it's in that range. On a full year basis, it's in that range. And then we finance it off of our revolver. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just remind me one more on the growth driver. Where are you in terms of the big account and bill pay conversions that you sort of had in your pipeline? What's concluded at this point? And what's still to come in '16? Jeffery Yabuki : The -- all of the large bill pay wins that we had been talking about before are now on. They're all completed. Now that I've said that, there may be a small portion of one of the institutions, which is a multi-chartered institution, but they're substantially onboard at this point. Now remember that one of [Audio Gap] referenced in his remarks is through our integrated payment strategy, which is a new experience that brings bill pay, transfer and P2P together. Effectively, that's introducing a new experience to all the more than 24 million bill pay users. And we think that's actually, Tom referenced, the early returns are positive. We're seeing a very nice acceptance and therefore utilization of this new experience which will be chunked out over -- basically, over the next 12 to 18 months. Thomas Hirsch : And I think your question on the account processing side, Glenn, just to add to that, I think we've seen some -- we had a number of larger institutions go live in the fourth quarter on our DNA solution and one large client in particular also converted, and so when those are going to be bringing out more revenue as we go into '16 and '17 clearly because of the surround impact and as those kind of roll in, but we had a good conversion quarter in the fourth quarter. Jeffery Yabuki : And we still have a fairly large backlog of DNA conversions moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just a couple of questions on the, I guess, first on the license sale. Why did you say that was below plan again? Was that cyclical or something more specific? Thomas Hirsch : Yes. We had some timing with that and it just wasn't as strong. There were a few deals that are -- both are international and our channels area that we just didn't hit on in the fourth quarter that kind of pushed off into '16. And it's not a large number for us, as you know, because the license revenue is fairly small, but a couple of those deals were just a little short on the license end in the current year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. And then just on the large deals coming back, that's nice to hear. We've heard that with some other players as well. What kind of projects are you seeing? Is it more on the account processing or integrated or DNA front? Just any context will be great. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it is. Actually, it's a pretty broad swath of larger deals. I would say that we have them in the account processing space, Output Solutions, Biller solutions, some actually good-sized deals in the card world. I mean, we actually -- I think the -- a bit of an absence of them -- or of the same number in '15, a lot of pipeline work got done and so it's fairly broad. It's not in just a single area. It's probably in 4 or 5 areas. Tien- Tsin Huang : So to the extent that some of these closed early on the year, could they convert to revenues in '16? And is that assumed? Jeffery Yabuki : We -- so yes, some of them could. Large deals typically take 12 to 18 months to convert, so some of them could. And I would say that our guidance assumes that we have normal conversion cycles. Operator : Our next question is from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, just out of curiosity, any -- the conversation you've had with banks, any thoughts about spending as they look in 2016? I know we hear a lot about energy and maybe the exposure isn't as great for your clients. But just thoughts as to how they're thinking about spending for 2016. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So I mean, clearly, there are some institutions that are being hit on the energy/oil issue, so that is having some impact. But I would call that relatively narrow. The majority of the banking industry seems to be at or slightly above in their \"budget\" for what they're going to spend on technology. And there's a lot of energy on mobile and on lending. Lending, there's a lot of noise in the market on alternative lenders and so you've got a lot of focus on how to think about a new lending experience that starts to merge mobile with data, real-time, speed, those kinds of assets and attributes. So you've got that going on. And you've got a fair amount of thought around branch transformation, and so all of that leads to good healthy conversations. We'll see how it ends up at the end of the year, but banks were pretty bullish going into this year. I think the current level of turmoil, it is a little bit of a wait-and-see market turmoil. But on balance, I think we're at least at the level that we would have seen for last year with the bias up. Kartik Mehta : And then, just finally. You've talked a lot about EMV and I understand just the basic opportunity you have to reissue cards. But as you've learned more about EMV, any other opportunities that you're seeing that maybe medium term or long term could generate additional revenue for you? Jeffery Yabuki : I don't know if I would say that I see additional opportunities directly related to the EMV card itself. I do see that there is a tremendous amount of activity in the payment space overall, and so there's a lot of -- that war at point-of-sale continues to be quite interesting. And then -- and frankly just so much energy around real-time non-point-of-sale payments. So the types of payment discussions are becoming very different, but exclusive to EMV, I don't... Mark Ernst : The only thing that really comes to mind is that we're obviously deeply involved in a lot of conversations about how tokenization of all different types of payments could be affected. And I'd say, that's an adjunct to what's happening with EMV. Kartik Mehta : And so, Mark, is there -- do you need to acquire any assets or technology or do you think where you are is good enough right now for you to take advantage of some of those? Mark Ernst : I'm not sure there's a lot you would acquire per se in that space; it's more about how you would set up your operations to provide tokenized services. So we're looking at all that. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe start off on the installed targets for DNA in 2016. I don't think you maybe provided that in your prepared script, so I think it was 30 in 2015 and you did 28. Can you maybe share with us what it looks like for this year? Jeffery Yabuki : Jim, I don't actually have that number off the top of my head. We'll do some work and get back to you, and then we'll make sure that we talk about it more broadly. But it likely would not be 28 this year. It'll a little bit lower than that. And then, of course, we'll have the benefit of all of the conversions that we moved in, in '15 will annualize in '16. James Schneider : Okay. And then just a clarification. I just want to make sure that I fully understand. On the ACI contributions this year, it sounds like by the time you get it closed, it's a little bit over a point contribution. And I just want to make sure that I heard you right that, that is included in the 5% to 6% full year revenue growth guidance. Jeffery Yabuki : No. The 5% to 6% is internal revenue only, not acquired revenue. So all acquired revenue is excluded from that calculation. Total adjusted revenue would be higher when you include the revenue. We were only -- I was only talking about the impact to our adjusted EPS. James Schneider : I understand. And then, one final one. Just in terms of the margin expansion potential, you obviously delivered very strong expansion this year and you're guiding to a little over 50 bps for 2016. Beyond the programmatic cost savings impact that you outlined of $40 million, are there other mix-related or are there other benefits that could potentially drive upside to that 50 bps of expansion? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I think we're obviously, Jim, coming off a very strong year where we delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion. And one of the key things has been the driving of the quality revenue that we have. If you look at our Payments-related segment, the Payments segment margins were up nicely. And that is a function of that high-quality revenue. Clearly, we gave guidance in '15 of greater than 50 basis points. I'm not saying we're going to outperform by that extent, but our guidance is greater than 50 in 2016 and our business model is functioning well and we're going to continue to push those levers. And I think I'm most pleased by is the opportunity we have over the next years to continue to drive that high-quality revenue and scale, along with this additional $250 million of Operational Effectiveness savings that we have good visibility into over the next several years. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Darrin Peller : I may have missed this, but did you give a sense into the growth by segment between the Payments, Financial in terms that's embedded in your guidance for the year? Jeffery Yabuki : No, we did not. We don't give segment guidance. But you can clearly tell, Darrin, right, the Payments segment just given the fact that EMV and IPS and a few other things that we talked about there are big drivers of kind of growth. So that's going to continue to be higher than our Financial segment. Darrin Peller : Okay. I just wanted to now hone in for a moment on the competitive dynamics around the real-time solutions you guys have clearly been doing well on, whether it's DNA or other platforms. But I mean it feels like that's been -- there's been a lot of demand in the market for that and you have the right solutions for that. Can you just comment on how much demand there is going into '16 around that specific offering capability on core account and what the competitive dynamic is out there for similar offerings for -- again, more for the real-time solutions? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. And Darrin, you're really talking about on the account processing side, not on the payment side, right? Darrin Peller : That's exactly right, yes. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So there's a lot of talk around real-time core systems and there is a lot of looking going on -- or there's not a lot -- not a lot relative numbers, but a lot on a relative basis to what we've seen historically for larger institutions looking at what would it take to convert real-time. There's a couple of larger mid-tiers that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so there is focus out there. We see some of the more progressive institutions in the $1 billion to $10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen beyond DNA. We've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last 3 or 4 years, I can't think of a -- I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so I only raise that because the other solutions that are being chosen are not real-time. So that means -- that may mean that the real-time is still early, or it may mean that our solution on a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institutions base, they're all real-time and the old thrifts are real-time. So you really have what -- the core banking world as the focus for real-time. And I think we'll continue to see that over the next 3 to 5 years, but we're early. Darrin Peller : Okay. Just last question for me, I appreciate it. But have you guys expressed any interest -- or do you find yourselves at all interested growing into the much, much larger global FIs in the world that we've seen some of your competitors trying to do? And on that note, I mean, you mentioned talking about international acquisitions down the road at some point. Any update on that front in terms of appetite now? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So the short answer is no. But we do -- but after I've said that, we do provide channel services, so our Corillian solution and our Mobiliti solution, to some of the larger banks in the world, whether it's ANZ or Bank of Ireland or Westpac. A number of clients today we're doing niche solutions. We are not in the business of doing large global banks on the core systems side. We are not in the business of doing services to large global banks unless they support one of our licensed technologies. We have risk solutions in a number of, again, niche solutions, but we're not going into that large services and licensed space. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Andrew Jeffrey : Recognizing that we're only talking about 100 basis points or so of revenue growth from EMV, to the extent that we see a ramp in '16 in the middle quarters and then ostensibly the sort of the rat moves through the snake. As we think about '17, do you have enough line of sight to say that '16 is in sort of a bulge year for revenue growth? Can we expect over time -- recognizing that you're not guiding to '17 today -- but can we expect over time, all else being equal, sort of a gradual improvement in organic revenue growth? Or are we going to be talking about difficult comps against the midpoint of '16 when we get out a year from now? Jeffery Yabuki : So let me try to answer this and make sure that we've got it answered, and Tom and Mark will help as needed. So you'll remember when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be 2 sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself, which is both the manufacturing and the personalization, and we believed that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions, that we would have a small lift on our processing revenue. And that, over time, that piece especially would build. We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between '15 and '17. And we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to -- sorry, and then when we get to full bow, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters, that we don't see that to be having a meaningful -- strike that, a material impact on our comps moving forward. Now if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in '17 -- '16, that could create a problem. We don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely and I don't think anyone could actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future. I can't tell you what's going to happen on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into '17 that we're going to see -- definitely see that smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day. And if you go back and take a look at that, I think that's probably the way that lays out. Thomas Hirsch : I think the other thing -- and then, Mark, I know you have a comment, too. I think, Andrew, remember our build is to grow 50 to 100 basis points on an annual basis. And at Investor Day, you could see we have a number of different moving parts there. As we look out I think longer, and Jeff just really hit on the EMV side of this, but if you look at different things like IPS, or you look at things like Agiliti, or you look at things like the NOW Network, those are factored in over those longer period cycles, which is '16, '17, '18, '19, because we're really trying to build this base of 50 to 100 basis points on average each year. And so Mark, I don't know if you want to add to that. Mark Ernst : The only other thing I was going to say about EMV is, and Jeff and Tom had it right that, while we will see the bigger uplift now in '16 over '15 and then it starts to flatten out because we don't get the ramp but we do have the continued level of reissue, as Jeff pointed out. The only other thing that we talked about at Investor Day was the potential in the event that prepaid becomes a card type that adopts EMV, that continues to be a big opportunity for us. But so far, we're not seeing anything in the market that would suggest that's likely to happen soon. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, all right. That helps me out. And then, Tom, again, kudos to you and the job you've done. We'll miss working with you. You've done a particularly good job in the last couple of years of improving working capital, which is exceptional I think for a processor. It's not something we often think about. How much working cap opportunity is there left in terms of being additive to core free cash flow from operations? Thomas Hirsch : I think we've gone pretty far with that. I think our business model though will continue to stay very honed in on that. What I mean by that, you're not going to see a lot of receivable growth in this company because of how -- that our high-quality revenues are going to turn into cash flow. So we've done a very good job of optimizing that, so I don't think there's a lot there. There are always a lot of different things, as we talk about, whether they be tax benefits through acquisitions, whether it continues to be on the CapEx side -- which, again, you saw higher levels this year because of our Alpharetta type deal. That's going to come back down to normal next year. And so I don't think anything really changing from that standpoint. Operator : Our next question is from Moshe Katri from Sterne Agee CRT. Moshe Katri : I appreciate the color on the big picture and the feedback from some of the FI clients. Obviously, we're about a month into the first quarter of the calendar year. Is there anything that kind of makes you worried about the possibility of budget slippages or any sort of pullback in spending given the macro environment? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I wish I had a fully reliable crystal ball for this. I mean, I would say the volatility in the market, as everyone feels like there's volatility, and we just have to continue to watch that. The beauty of the majority of the solutions that we provide is they're not discretionary. And with all of the digital transformation that's occurring in the market today, there's a real need for institutions to invest and to keep up with what's going on. Consumer expectations are growing so rapidly because of the -- everything that's going on in the retail world and in the non-financial services world that there -- and as those expectations are requiring institutions to invest it's becoming -- very much becoming nondiscretionary. And so I continue to believe we're going to continue to see solid growth in those kinds of solutions in '16 and into the foreseeable future. Moshe Katri : And then if you look at your revenue base, is there a way to quantify which part of the revenues are generated from what we call discretionary and nondiscretionary? So can we assume that maybe 80%, 90% of your business is kind of recurring and kind of critical for the day-to-day operation of your typical FI? Jeffery Yabuki : No. I mean, I don't know that there's much that we do that's not important to the FI. I mean, we have very small businesses that are data-oriented businesses, which I guess you could argue are not necessarily -- that are not necessarily mission-critical. But even the things that we sell that are \"discretionary,\" it's hard to know if you're on a -- if you have to upgrade software on a solution that you use to manage risk, that purchase may be discretionary so you may have some wiggle room. But much of what we do is nondiscretionary from that perspective. I don't think we're ever going to see a whole lot of variability in any year almost regardless of situation. But clearly, clearly, I have the same crystal ball question that everyone else has. We believe that the banking industry right now is in pretty good shape. The rate increases will move through this year, and I think that will be generally good for banks. I'm talking about not prospective increases, but just the December raise, and I think that'll be good. And we'll see how the economy develops. I think that will be the ultimate linchpin for how banks decide to invest over the next few years. Operator : Our last question is from Paul Condra from Credit Suisse. Paul Condra : Just a couple of quick ones. Just the $250 million Operational Effectiveness Plan. Is that kind of a 6-year plan? So that's like $40 million, $50 million a year? Thomas Hirsch : Yes, 5 years. But yes, that's exactly right. And it's going to ramp a little bit like I talked about earlier. Paul Condra : Okay. And then, lastly, just to return to EMV one last time. I mean, is it possible that this goes on longer than you're expecting; that maybe you don't get the surge in mid-2016 and it's just kind of a steady ramp over the next couple of years? Jeffery Yabuki : We feel really good about the surge in '16, primarily because we know what's been manufactured, we know what has not been personalized, we know what has been personalized. We know what's been ordered. So we actually have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen in '16. We don't have a lot of visibility right now into what's going to happen in '17 except for we'll know who has not issued. And remember, you've got in '17 -- I believe in '17 you've got one more liability shift that's going to happen. So we feel really pretty confident about the EMV at the level that we have incorporated into our guidance. It could go -- I suppose, it could go a little bit higher. It could always glow bit lower, but it's pretty solid at this stage. Thomas Hirsch : And remember, Paul, the clients have paid for the -- a lot of the -- right, the manufacturing stuff, right, so they're going to want to issue these cards when they can. And again, we have to wait for that. But as Jeff indicated right now, we feel good about where we are in '16 and going into '17 also. Mark Ernst : The only other thing I'd add to that is 2015 was really the wildcard year from our perspective, because we didn't know how fast financial solutions were going to adopt EMV and whether there would be a mass reissue. That debate is pretty must behind us now and we can see what our clients are doing and how they're approaching it. So we have pretty good line of sight into what we think is going to happen now in '16. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. One other point I would make is, actually, in Q4, we had more demand for BIN configuration than we could actually convert. So we really saw this surge coming into the year which, again, helps support the confidence. And remember, even if we have a bit of a blip up in '16, which we believe we will, we do think that we'll get to a steady-state level. We don't see the EMV -- we do think that EMV will be constant on a card manufacturing and personalization basis moving forward so long as plastic is being issued. And I think that's going to be issued for a very long time, and then a layer of uptick on the premium processing element of EMV. Thomas Hirsch : And I think I'd also just check out what Mark went over at Investor Day, because it's pretty well holding as far as what we anticipated where we'd be a little softer in '15 obviously. But nonetheless, it's ramping as we thought it would there. Paul Condra : Okay that's great. And Jeff, maybe just last thoughts on Popmoney. There's a lot of competition in that space now, and I know you've been really excited about that business. I mean, any kind of modifications or changes to your view? Jeffery Yabuki : No. It is something I still am very excited about. It is taking longer to get scales than I would have liked. But I am very optimistic about the runway for the solution given the pairing with -- of P2P with real-time, which I think changes the experience dramatically. And then the other use cases that we have for Popmoney disbursements and some of the charities we think are very important. And then the last thing is we've got a new technology that we are delivering in 2016. We call it card-free cash and it is a way for our debit clients, our ATM clients to be able to access money at an ATM without a card using their mobile -- the bank's mobile solution. Well, that's actually going to be branded Popmoney across the U.S. So that brand will show up across 20,000, 30,000 ATMs. So again, we have a good level of comfort that it will grow. Yes, it's competitive. But over time, I still believe the banks are going to be the ultimate winners of the P2P battle. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations group. And have a good evening. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by welcoming our new CFO, Bob Hau, to his inaugural Fiserv earnings call. Bob has been with us for about 2 months and is quickly getting up to speed. We're excited about the skills and experience he brings to the company. Now, on to the results. We're pleased with our start as each of our key financial metrics were ahead of plan for the quarter. And importantly, we're right on track to meet our financial commitments for the full year. Internal revenue growth was a solid 4%, which included 170 basis points of drag from the timing of license-related revenue, EMV personalization deferral and the negative impact of FX in the quarter. Growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow per share were stellar, each up 19% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was also strong, increasing 80 basis points over the prior year. We were again, for the third year in a row, named one of FORTUNE magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. For the first time, we were recognized as the top company for innovation within the financial data services category. We are honored by this three-peat, which recognizes our culture of driving value for clients, associates and shareholders. As you will recall, we shared 3 key priorities for 2016 to help you gauge our progress which, as a reminder, are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter. We saw strong performance in areas such as card services, electronic payments, lending and Output Solutions. We expect to see continued revenue acceleration throughout the year, notably being driven by strong performance in our recurring revenue businesses. Adjusted operating income was up 8%, largely resulting from growth in high-quality revenue and a continuing focus on operational efficiency. Adjusted EPS and free cash flow per share were both up 19% for the quarter, not including the $140 million cash distribution received from our StoneRiver joint venture. Again, we're on pace to achieve our financial goals for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We scheduled our earnings call a bit later this quarter to accommodate Forum, our Spring Client Conference held last week. We were pleased to have nearly 4,000 people experiencing Fiserv, including educational sessions, networking and over 170 technology solutions on display to help our clients deliver the experiences that their customers are looking for today. The convergence of mobile and convenience is having a meaningful effect on consumer expectations for speed, ease and access. Fiserv has been focused on innovation designed to address these burgeoning demands. Two new solutions, CardValet and Immediate Funds, were recipients of the 2016 PYMNTS.com innovation awards in their respective categories. These awards recognize potentially disruptive, highly differentiated technologies and are real-world examples of how our solutions enable clients to provide superior value to the customers they serve. Mobiliti ASP subscribers were up nearly 40% from the prior year and 9% sequentially to more than 4.5 million users, reflecting continuing strong demand for mobile services. We remain confident that mobile subscriber growth will be substantial over the next several years as adoption levels continue to accelerate. In addition, Mobiliti is a catalyst for driving value-added transactions such as mobile capture, bill payment and Popmoney. We're seeing strong demand for EMV issuance and expect that to continue for several years, especially with the eventuality of contactless technologies. And still, we've not yet reached the tipping point where card manufacturing and card personalization are equal. As a result, we deferred an additional $5 million of revenue in the quarter. We expect card personalization trends to continue improving in the second half of the year, which should lead to further acceleration in EMV revenue. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Vibrant Credit Union became the 48th new DNA client to go live since the Open Solutions acquisition. DNA serves as the technology foundation for Vibrant to deliver differentiated products, services and experiences to its more than 41,000 members. Vibrant management cited DNA's superior agility, flexibility and speed of customization as key factors in converting from a well-known competitive offering, primarily serving larger credit unions. We expect this conversion to provide additional proof points to further fuel momentum in the large credit union space. Our DNA pipeline has continued to grow, with a bias to larger banks and credit unions as technology buyers see value in a real-time modern platform. Implementations are progressing nicely with more than 20 new DNA clients, including 8 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion expected to go live in 2016. Importantly, as new account processing clients tend to select broad suites of solutions, revenue in both segments should benefit as implementations come on throughout the year. Last week, we also announced an important partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services into our account processing platforms. We believe offering these market-leading capabilities in an on-demand, cost-effective manner will even further enhance our competitive position in the larger end of the market. Lastly, we closed 2 acquisitions we had previously announced during the quarter. In January, we completed a small biller solutions acquisition that expands our capabilities through our modern SaaS platform and provides access to new verticals for payment acceptance. And in early March, we closed the acquisition of ACI Worldwide's Community Financial Services business. This transaction adds digital banking clients and some unique capabilities, including Architect, an integrated online and mobile banking solution serving retail and business customers on a single platform. We expect these acquisitions to contribute $75 million to $85 million of adjusted revenue in 2016, and that the adjusted EPS contribution to be fairly minimal as synergies ramp late in the year and then into 2017. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experiences complement Fiserv's business. I really like what I've seen so far and look forward to meeting you in the near future as we continue to deliver value to clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now turning to a little more detail in the first quarter results. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion and internal revenue growth was 4%. As Jeff mentioned, internal revenue growth performance was strong, especially considering several items that together negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 170 basis points in the quarter, 110 basis points from the timing of license-related revenue in the Financial segment, 40 basis points from the EMV revenue deferral and 20 basis points related to currency. Our high-quality revenue growth, combined with continued discipline and operating efficiency, drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $399 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 19% to $1.06, and free cash flow per share was also up 19% to $1.31. Adjusted operating margin was strong in the quarter, up 80 basis points over the prior year to 31.9%. As you've seen, we're off to a great start in the Payments segment. Adjusted revenue, which includes a partial quarter contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 9% to $671 million. Internal revenue growth was up a strong 7% in the segment. Debit transactions grew in the high single digits over last year's comparable quarter, and we continue to gain traction in our bundled debit credit offering. Not only should this proposition drive the debit business but also extends our credit processing footprint to capitalize on the growth potential in our client base. Solutions such as CardValet and CardFree Cash enhance the traditional card-based value proposition and creates quality revenue for our clients. Looking beyond the point-of-sale, we added more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter, signed nearly 100 institutions for Popmoney and saw P2P transactions grow 30%. Popmoney Instant transactions were also up 70% for the quarter. Our Output Solutions business recorded strong growth, even with the EMV personalization revenue deferral. As Jeff referenced earlier, we expect to see the revenue deferrals subside and potentially begin to reverse as we expect personalization to accelerate later in the year and into 2017. Payments segment adjusted operating income was up an impressive 18% to $225 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded a very strong 230 basis points over the prior year. Synergies for our new acquisitions, which are included in the Payments segment, should ramp as we exit 2016. Therefore, we expect roughly a 60 basis point negative impact on the segment margin this year. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 1% to $599 million. Revenue growth in the segment was negatively impacted by 220 basis points due to a decrease in higher margin license-related revenue as compared to last year. On the plus side, we saw good performance in our lending and international businesses in the quarter. And we expect revenue acceleration in the second half of the year due to the rollout of new technology solutions, the timing of license-related revenue and new client implementations. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million and adjusted operating margin was 32.6%. Lower comparable results in the quarter were primarily from the timing of high margin license-related revenue, negative impact of FX and the timing of innovation-based investments in solutions, such as Agiliti and Notifi. We expect much stronger results in the second half of the year. Corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was basically in line with the prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 33%, and we benefited from timing of expected discrete tax benefits, which when compared to the prior year provided about $0.03 of adjusted EPS improvement in the quarter. The Q1 rate is consistent with our 2016 guidance, and we continue to anticipate a full year adjusted effective tax rate of about 35%. Free cash flow grew 11% in the quarter to $298 million and was up 19% on a per share basis to $1.31. These excellent results are primarily due to high-quality revenue growth and disciplined capital allocation. We recorded a net gain of $146 million and received $140 million of cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture related to the sale of our business interest. Both the gain and related cash distribution are excluded from reported adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. And since this venture was formed in 2008. We've realized $1.1 billion including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest. Although there are only limited assets remaining in this venture, we're very pleased with its overall performance. Total debt as of March 31 was $4.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $92 per share for just over $320 million. At quarter-end, there were 223 million shares outstanding and 14 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Well done. Following our record sales performance in Q4, our results were somewhat slow, coming in at 70% of quota for the quarter. That said, activity levels continue to be very strong in the quarter, with our domestic pipeline up 14% since December 31 and up 26% year-over-year. We anticipate a number of significant wins over the next couple of quarters and fully expect to achieve our sales goals for the year. Integrated sales is a key part of our product distribution strategy and was up 10% to $48 million for the quarter, led by card services, bill payment and channels. We're in the first year of our new $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our goal for this year is $40 million, and we achieved $10 million of savings in the first quarter, driven primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We're also progressing very well in our data center program which we expect will provide meaningful operational savings in the future. Even as banks prognosticate on interest rate increases, we are seeing an important bias to action in driving online and mobile solutions. Customer expectations are ratcheting up, and that translates to opportunities to further differentiate our broad catalog of solutions, including channels, payments and account processing. Speaking of payments, we're seeing an increased focus on payments beyond the point-of-sale. As you know, we have been preparing for this movement, and we are encouraged by the industry dialogue with an emphasis across the largest banks. We expect these plans to solidify over the next 12 months and believe we will play an important role in the ultimate solution. As I mentioned, we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, which includes internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 12% to 15% in a range of $4.32 to $4.44. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full year results to bias above the midpoint of the range and that the adjusted EPS growth rate will be generally equivalent between the first and second halves of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, even with the approximately 30 basis points of acquisition margin pressure Bob mentioned earlier. And importantly, we still expect free cash flow per share for the full year to be at least $4.70. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We expect to meet or exceed our financial and strategic commitments, including another step-up in our level of sustainable, high-quality revenue growth. Our ability to excel is based entirely on the dedication, commitment and innovation of our 22,000 associates who band together to achieve client excellence each and every day. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mr. Dave Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : You called out 220 basis points of pressure in the FI segment on internal growth from deferred software license sales or postponed software license sales. Can you give us a little bit more insight to that? And then more broadly could you talk about sort of spending intentions and budgets of your FI customers for this year? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. David, let me clarify. We didn't say it was from postponed spending. What we said is that our license-related revenue was lower this quarter than it was last year. It was really much more around how strong last year's first quarter was relative to this obviously Q1 in '16, and we expect to see that come back. It wasn't that spending was postponed. It was really just the timing of last year's license-related revenue versus the license-related revenue that we expect for this year. On the question of spending, we're not seeing any change in the environment, certainly no negative change. And in fact, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're actually seeing a pretty clear realization across all segments of the market that -- and this may sound a little bit funny, but that mobile is here to stay. And that the finding the right way to craft, whether you call it omnichannel or how to find the points of relationship management between mobile experiences and in-branch experiences and online experiences and teller, whatever other ways -- or I'm sorry, ATM, whatever other way they're coming together, that's a very big focus for the institutions. And that also links to the need to provide real-time information. It's putting -- we think it's actually helping us a lot on the modern platform side. So those platforms such as DNA that are modern, we're getting a lot of attention. So from that perspective, the spend trends are quite solid right now. David Togut : Understood. And then on your DNA point, can you talk about market share trends in the large credit union space. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we mentioned that we had the Vibrant Credit Union go live in the quarter. And we mentioned that, that was a competitive takeaway from one of our peers who tends to serve the larger credit union base. It was actually one of the first times we've had a client make that switch. And so we're quite excited about that, and we expect of that will build some momentum for us going forward. David Togut : Got it. And then on the EMV-related card personalization, I recall from the fourth quarter call you were pointing more toward 2Q and 3Q acceleration in EMV revenue growth. And now you seem to be a little more focused on second half. Am I understanding that correctly? Mark Ernst : No. David, this is Mark Ernst. No, I think you pretty much have it. That hasn't really changed in our perspective. What we really are kind of noting is that the gap between manufacturing and personalization which, as you know, creates a requirement on our side because we do both pieces of that business to defer the manufacturing revenue until we personalize. We're seeing a little bit more of continued sort of pushback of the personalization activity. So we expect that there's going to be a little bit more deferral into Q2 and maybe even into Q3. But we think the tools start to balance out then in the second half. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, and we still believe that the middle quarters, so Qs 2 and 3, will still be the strongest on a growth contribution basis. Same as we had believed in the middle of the year. Mark Ernst : And it's really about the year-over-year compare. I mean we get some pickup now in Q1. There'll be bigger pickup in Qs 2 and 3. And then in Q4, we have a comparison to last year's Q4, which -- where we had started to see the EMV revenue coming in. Robert Hau : The other thing I'd add is the deferral has declined over the last 3 quarters $9 million, $7 million, now $5 million successfully. So we'll see that continue. Jeffery Yabuki : David, the other thing just to keep in mind is while we're talking a lot about how EMV is building this year, I mean, we're still quite early in our level of everything from personalization, which is kind of the last step. But if you back up the process even BIN enablement, we're still in the very early innings of that. So we do expect this to continue to contribute for a while. And then we do believe that come end of '17 into '18 that you would expect to see dual band or contactless start to have an impact as well. David Togut : Just 2 quick housekeeping questions. What was the term fee comparison in the quarter? And then how much revenue do you expect for the balance of the year from acquisitions completed? Jeffery Yabuki : So David, term fees were up just a few million dollars for the quarter. And then, of course, that's offset by, as we talked about, the license-related revenue which was down about $13 million. Robert Hau : And on the acquisition-related revenues, it's probably in the $75 million to $85 million for the year... Jeffery Yabuki : Full year. Full year. So we've got about -- figure, David, we have a little over a month of total contribution if you exclude the smaller biller acquisition. So the majority of that's coming in, in the last 3 quarters of the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : And I guess first of all just on the payments margins, I know it's the first quarter that you had the acquisitions in there and EMV probably comes on at a little bit lower margins but they were incredibly strong in Q1 especially given Q1 is usually -- if we went back several years, usually it's the low bar for margins. What's kind of happening in the underlying basis there to drive such good margins? And maybe how do you see the rest of the year? Is Q1 the low point? Jeffery Yabuki : So that's a great question. And one of the things that we've been talking about for a while is that the beauty of these payments businesses is they tend to have network economics. And so when the payments businesses are growing in the right places, you're going to have higher incremental margins that are dropping through. So that's one point. We have been making, as you know, a lot of investments that are, -- as we bring on that revenue, that also helps us as we get to scale. So that's having a positive impact. And it's offset a bit by the -- we had a month of the ACI CFS acquisition. And -- but for that, I would say that we would continue to see that build, but we are going to get some pressure, as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we'll get some pressure on that, about 60 basis points of pressure in the Payments segment from that during the year. Now we still expect that we'll achieve at least 50 basis points for the full year but we will have some pressure there. And then, Dave, as we anniversary that next year, we would expect to see that contribution come back on as well as the added benefit of the synergies from the acquisitions, which really will be very late in '16 and into '17. David Koning : Okay. Great. It seems you're set up well. And then I guess secondly the corporate expense line, the adjusted corporate expense was $21 million. It was the lowest in a long time despite the addition of the new businesses coming on. Is that going to stay a little bit of a lower run rate going forward? Robert Hau : Yes. Q1 was a bit lower than we've traditionally seen. I would anticipate the full year roughly in line with what we saw last year. Mark Ernst : From kind of a trajectory of growth perspective, with a little bit, Dave, to your point, we'll have a little bit of excess expense coming in from the acquisitions. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : The sale's somewhat slow. Is that, Jeff, just a function of slow start of the year and sort of back to normal? I know you were at Fiserv Forum. I'm curious to hear what some of the decisions makers are saying. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Tien-tsin, as you know, we had record results in Q4. And we actually thought we were going to have a little bit of a stronger start to the year, actually. And as is often the case, these larger deals, they have a little bit of a path of their own, and they had -- we had some slippage. I think I put in our prepared comments that we expect to have some good size sales announced in Q2 and Q3. But I would tell you the pipeline itself, you could see the growth in the pipeline, the sequential growth, we had kind of mid-teens sequential growth in the pipeline and the year-over-year growth was in the mid-20s. So really good growth there. A lot of activity. And I'll tell you, we were really excited about the discussions we had at Forum. We -- in terms of both the innovative products as well as we had one of the highest numbers of prospects and attendance that we've ever had. In fact, it is the highest we've ever had. So a lot of good dialogue. And we're going to have to find that balance between predictability of when some of these larger transactions are going to happen and how that wraps into the quota. The good news for us is, as you and others know, the substantial majority of the sales revenue that would come -- or the sales-related revenue that would come in from these larger transactions has no effect on our current quarter and really very little effect on the full year. So that does give us a little bit of hope on the -- or I'm sorry, gives us a little bit of confidence on the offset. Just one last thing. I would say a couple of the larger transactions that we have in our pipeline that we expect to close in Q2 do have some seasonality benefits that we will actually -- will help us in the second half of the year. So we're feeling good about where we are from a sales standpoint. Tien- Tsin Huang : All right. It is good to know. Just on the bigger deals in general, the pricing, is it a little tougher from a pricing perspective to get these things over the finish line or not necessarily so? Jeffery Yabuki : Honestly, pricing is always pricing. And you've always had to find that balance in any kind of seller-buyer negotiation. That tends to not be the issue in these larger transactions. They tend to be far more around the readiness of the buyer to develop their plans enough because, as you know, a lot of the larger transactions for us tend to be big, mission-critical systems. And so it takes a long time for the buyers to get comfortable. And then there's always a lot of negotiation on normal Ts and Cs. So they just tend to take longer from that standpoint not from pricing. When pricing is a problem, that usually actually rears its head pretty early in the process. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got you. That's good to know. One more if you don't mind, just on the EMV front, I caught the timing. But I'm curious overall, is there like a halo effect of some sort from EMV kind of helping drive more bundled sales as you're assisting with these big decisions or could you even be the inverse, and that's sort of taking time away from other things you can have conversations about with your FI clients? Mark Ernst : Yes. I got to say, I don't think we're seeing EMV factor into those kinds of conversations. I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there, but I would say it's really playing into that discussion. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, the other angle on that, Tien-tsin, where I thought maybe you were also asking is the fact that institutions are spending on EMV doesn't seem to be taking away from the other areas in which the institutions do need to spend. And we see that to be primarily around mobile and risk and cyber and those kinds of things. So we're... Mark Ernst : And in most ways, EMV is sort of an operating cost to institution versus big CapEx for some of these bigger systems. So it's 2 different kind of problems. Operator : Next question comes from Mr. Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer & Co. Glenn Greene : First question. Maybe, Jeff, you could give us a little bit more color on sort of the drivers of the back half organic growth acceleration relative to the 4% and getting you into that 5%, 6% range for the year? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Yes, I mean, there's probably 4 or 5 big areas in which we're seeing that you can call out seeing the impact. As Mark was talking about earlier as he talked about prepared remarks, we see EMV being a good-sized chunk of that, both ramped-up demand as well as less of a differential between the manufacturing timing and the personalization timing. So we see that coming in as we mentioned in Qs 2 and 3 but also having a ramp effect in 4. Mobiliti subscriber growth is looking really strong. We were up 9% sequentially. We expect to see a significant amount of growth for that, as you know, with that service, as we put the users on the system, it becomes a bit of monthly subscription revenue, so that's good news. Next item is around DNA. As the DNA implementations continue to ramp -- but not just DNA, it's all account processing implementations. In fact at the end of Q2, our largest implementation of the year will go in. It's actually not a DNA implementation. So we're excited about that. And remember that, that brings in not only revenue in the Financial segment, but they tend to be bundled large transactions so they go across the enterprise. And then lastly, we have a series of new initiatives that are just gaining traction. Some of them that we talked about before, such as IPS that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing good growth, Bob mentioned that in his prepared comments. Agiliti, which we've talked about, is going quite well. And then something like Notifi, which is an alerting hub, an alerting capability across all of our solutions, which will go live in Q4. Any number of those we expect to help drive that growth. Now remember the difference between -- even between 4% and 5% is not that significant when you think about it on a quarterly basis. Roughly $10 million is 1 point. So it takes a fair number of things to come together, but there's no single one item that we're counting on, and so it's around the execution of the company. And then as these -- I guess the last thing I would say is as these larger -- we talked about both pipeline growth, as these larger transactions get closed, some of them have seasonality benefits. And obviously there'll be a bit of revenue coming in from all of them. And while no one of them is probably \"worthy\" of calling out individually, when they come together, they'll have some impact late in the year. Glenn Greene : Okay. That's helpful. Next question on the Financial margins being down the way they were. It is simple as the $13 million year-over-year software decline? So first question was, is the license decline all in Financial? And does that the explanation for the Financial margin pressure? And was that also expected as you went through the year? Jeffery Yabuki : I think the answers are yes, yes, and yes. Robert Hau : Yes, correct. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we saw -- we obviously saw that coming in -- coming that we were going to have the license-related revenue blip in Q1 that we believe we would make it up as we move throughout the year in a more typical, call it, selling cycle. But that is the big -- I mean, that's the big animal in the segments, couple of hundred basis points of growth in the segment. And as you know, license revenue tends to have pretty high margin. Glenn Greene : Okay. Makes sense. One more would be -- so the $75 million to $85 million, I think that's I guess for the portion of the year that you have the acquisitions. It seems a little bit low to me. Is -- are you being conservative? Have you baked in attrition? Or am I just sort of not thinking through the numbers right? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, we have -- if you compare it to the 8-K that ACI filed, we would say we have absolutely baked in the attrition that was already embedded in that asset, and we also have actually a good level of confidence that we will stem some of the attrition that was there. Obviously, ACI wanted to exit that business because it wasn't core to them and it probably wasn't getting enough attention. So from that perspective, we factored that in. The big dog in all of that is it's just 9 months of the year. Mark Ernst : And don't forget, we were -- they were reselling some of our services. And so that reseller relationship does not come over in our revenues. So that's also... Jeffery Yabuki : That's a great point. They were reselling. Mark Ernst : That's also a key factor. Jeffery Yabuki : That's a great point. Glenn, so they were reselling -- basically reselling RXP. And so that revenue that they were -- what they were showing as marked up revenue, we do not get credit for that. Operator : Next question is coming from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I had another question about the cadence of EMV revenue later this year. I mean, should we be thinking about this as a sort of pressure building? And how is that finally kind of gets pushed? Is it kind of a snapback? Or is it sort of more of a consistent, steady increased level of revenue that sort of persists for a longer period of time? Mark Ernst : Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly going to be a level of revenue that persists for a longer period of time. We think that once it gets to a sort of steady state of revenue generation that we will see that be the stable kind of level going forward. So it's not something that we're going to get a big burst and then it's going to go away or it's going to diminish meaningfully. So I'd say that's the way we think about it. This mismatch on deferral of revenue between manufacturing and personalization is kind of a twist on the timing quarter-to-quarter. But we think by the end of '16, the effects of that will pretty much in the base numbers. And then the other thing I'd mention, Jeff referred to contactless a little bit earlier. We're hearing more conversations about contactless in the market. It's a little early to call that out as something that is necessarily out there. But that would be another kind of lift in the out years beyond the kind of the steady-state lift that we are seeing coming from EMV. Jeffery Yabuki : And Ramsey, remember that the other factor is we still have -- we -- all of the key dates of when the fraud switches has not yet happened, we still have gasoline and a couple of other areas that will swap. So we still don't have all -- and when debit -- that's a big user of debit. Mark Ernst : And the other thing that we know that's going on in the market is the adoption rate of EMV at point-of-sale is still a little bit delayed. So while there's a lot of people pushing these cards out into the market, the issuer side is probably a little bit ahead of the acceptance or the merchant side. So we think that this just continues to kind of push the whole innovation or change in the methodology into the future. Jeffery Yabuki : And then I guess the last thing just as a reminder on that is, to Mark's point, it is -- and to your point, Ramsey, it is a continuing build. And we aren't anywhere near that peak yet. I mean as I mentioned, we still have a very low level of even BINs enabled. So there's still a lot of -- a lot of this is going to happen throughout all this year and frankly well into next. Mark Ernst : And not to get into the weeds too much more, but don't forget, one of the key things that we know is there's kind of these additional fees for EMV transactions. So as the acceptance of EMV at point-of-sale becomes bigger and bigger, that benefits us in our card services business as well. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That's all very, very helpful. On a completely separate track, we haven't seen kind of large M&A from you guys in a little while. Is lack of getting a large deal done due to sort of a dearth of compelling opportunities? Or is it more a shift in your priorities? I know the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not looked terribly favorably on higher leverage levels more recently. Have you changed your kind of historic balance sheet prioritization strategy or is it just a question of not finding the right deals? Jeffery Yabuki : It -- I would say it's a question of not finding the right potential transactions at the right prices given the discipline that we use when we think about allocating capital. I mean, we continue to be very focused on what are the best ways for us to build value for our shareholders through -- last year I think we generated over $1 billion of free cash. So that's a really important part of our model. And so we continue to think about share repurchase as our benchmark. And acquisitions need to be compared against that on a risk -- kind of on a risk-adjusted basis. So for us, it's using that framework in the context of everything we would look at in the market. It's really not about leverage or anything else. It's about what's the right and best way to build shareholder value. Operator : Next question is coming from Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the number of DNA client wins that are set to come on board in 2016. Is that a number in the zip code of about 20 or so? And can you maybe just kind of give us an update on that deployment schedule. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it is, Jim. I think, in our script we said it was more than 20. It's a bit more than 20. And we've got I think 7 or 8 of them are assets greater than $1 billion. And again, that's just on the DNA side. We have -- we'll have many more implementations across the system on the account processing side of the house. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of maybe an update on the overall client IT discretionary spend environment and what you're hearing from clients there, I mean, clearly there has been some -- there's been a little -- they're rocky this past quarter. So for some of the clients, can you maybe give us a sense about whether you're seeing any kind of incremental delays in new implementations or new business side? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we -- and it's interesting that you mentioned this -- you mentioned that. I mean, we are not seeing significant delays in -- let me say that in a different way. We are not seeing IT budgets have impacts on demand for the products and solutions that we're building. And so I think the good news is for the most part, our growth and the areas of our focus are tending to be in places that are -- have really good macros like Mobiliti as a trend. So it's being tailwinds that are making that happen. And then we have a lot of emphasis on solutions that are driving revenue for the financial institution. And then third is really using DNA as the poster child where you've got these modern technologies that I think there's just a belief across the financial institution system that the need to use more modern technologies given what's going on with Mobiliti is really important. So we're not seeing issues around there. Now as I mentioned in my discussion on our prepared remarks, sales cycles are still sales cycles and they're always going to take time. But we are really quite encouraged about what we see in the pipeline right now, both in size of deals, types of deals and, frankly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seeding a lot of optimism and future growth opportunities for us. Operator : Next question is coming from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, you talked a lot about Mobiliti and the demand you're seeing from mobile from banks. I'm wondering, is that having any impact for demand on online banking? So my thought is, is the fact that banks want to invest in mobile shifting any money away from online banking? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Interestingly, that was one of the concerns that we had early on is that the world would go to a mobile-only world. And what's happened is we've gone to a mobile-first world but followed closely by online second. And in fact, we're seeing a lot more focus on institutions wanting to facelift and upgrade their online channel because of the pressure that mobile is putting on that. And you can see -- if you're doing industry reading and outside the industry, a lot of discussion on making sure that you have an online experience that is consistent with the tablet and mobile experiences. And that's really creating, we think, more opportunity for us, and frankly others, but really for us moving forward because of the pressure on the online channel to keep up with mobile. The other thing to always keep in mind is the reasons why people interact in certain channels are not the same. So checking my balance is something I might do on a mobile device. But a loan application, for the most part, I'm not going to do on -- my kids might do it on their mobile device but I'm not going to. Only to say that for a long time, although this is merging a bit, for a long time, we talked about mobile more as a snack metaphor and online being a little bit more of a meal metaphor. So you've got different kinds of activities and duration of experience going on in both of those places. Kartik Mehta : So I guess, Jeff, in aggregate, the spend is not less. If anything it's probably more for a bank. Is that a fair statement? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Mark Ernst : Yes. Kartik Mehta : And then, Jeff, just out of curiosity, Popmoney, I don't think you mentioned in this call, and I'm just wondering maybe the progress you're making on that or if any delays or if anything happened in the marketplace that maybe is delaying the implementation or acceptance. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. No, I think we -- I think actually Bob had in his prepared remarks. I think Popmoney transactions were up 30% in the quarter. Pop Instant transactions were up 70% in the quarter. We sold a good number of new institutions. Robert Hau : 100 new institutions. Jeffery Yabuki : About 100 new institutions. So that's actually getting a fairly nice amount of play. Of course, we'd like it to be larger than it had been, but we are pleased that it's moving along. The other thing that we've done is we've moved -- you may remember, we talked about this IPS, this integrated payment strategy. That integrated payment strategy takes bill pay, Popmoney and account-to-account transfers and moves it into a single, unified experience for users. That will especially be important on mobile because it's hard to move through tabs and things like that. But on balance, we're getting exposure to many more users, and we're seeing a lot more interest in the product. And then lastly, there's a macro that's going on, where the larger banks are putting more and more emphasis on P2P. I think there is a movement in the industry right now to make sure, frankly, that P2P remains bank-centric. We've been pushing on that for several years, and we are absolutely committed to making sure that, that happens. So there's a lot of movement -- macro movement that haven't seen in a long time, and we're excited about it. We think it's going to play out in a pretty interesting way over the next year. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Jeff. You talked a little bit about Tien-tsin's question on pricing. And I'm wondering, pricing on the renewals, I know in the industry that's always been an issue, some pressure on pricing on renewals. And I'm wondering if you're seeing anything different than you have in the past as far as renewals our concern. Jeffery Yabuki : No. I mean, not ever since that I've been here, little over 10 years now, and it's always been the case. You have compression on renewals and then they build back up because of the pricing -- the underlying pricing structure for the most part. So that continues. The point that I was making earlier was really a new sales point where we're seeing kind of what I would call more normal pricing. And that the issues in getting transaction closed are less around price than they are other factors. Mark Ernst : But, Kartik, the one thing I would say, because I know one of our competitors referenced pricing pressure on renewals, I got to say we're not seeing anything to the degree that we would have called it out like that. Operator : Our last question for today is coming from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I guess my first question is with regards to same-day ACH, faster ACH. I mean, what sort of impact do you see in terms of attraction for your existing products, CardFree Cash or Popmoney or -- I mean, does it have roll-through traction for other products that you have? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I mean there's a couple of different ways to think about that, Ashwin. Given we own PEP+, which is for the most part the de facto ACH standard in the U.S., I mean that's a good enhancement of that product. We've been working same-day ACH for several years. So we're happy that the industry is adopting it. We see a lot of great opportunity to use ACH in different ways. In terms of being able to meet the demands of consumers who are really far more focused on speed, ease and convenience, and ACH is a reasonable way to do that. We don't see ACH being really a viable point-of-sale alternative. What we do see, if you have a bill that you want to move quickly, we see that same day can be quite valuable there or emergency payrolls and all kinds of other things, so we're optimistic about that. I don't -- things like CardFree Cash will be working -- that will be going over the card network. So it's a little bit of a different animal. I do think that the plumbing, right, the entire infrastructure, the payments infrastructure is being kind of globally re-examined right now. And so there's -- in my mind, there's a lot of puts and takes on how we're all thinking about the plumbing. And I suspect over the next 5, 7 years that it'll play out in a way that looks a little bit different than it looks today. Mark Ernst : I mean, I've got to say, I'd add to that. I think at this stage much of this is still about plumbing. I mean the use case is for the version of same-day ACH that's out there. I mean, we are clearly in those conversations. But people are working hard to find appropriate use cases for that solution. Jeffery Yabuki : And the fact -- but the cold, hard reality is as consumers become comfortable with moving money faster or have a desire to move money faster, that will play very well in products like Popmoney, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- somewhat like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in products like Venmo, right. The viral capabilities of that -- the marketing capabilities are quite strong. And we do think that a bank-centric solution makes sense, that it will happen and that, that will create a lot of opportunity for those of us who are in that segment of the market. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And one quick follow-on is, you guys talked about the cadence of synergies from the acquisitions. I guess the part that I may have missed is if you carry forward to next year, could you size the ongoing benefit? I mean, it's a bit of a cost this year but when it swings, do you expect a greater than normal margin improvement next year if you can comment on that? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, we would certainly expect to see incremental margin improvement from that. I think when we announced that we were buying this, we indicated that we thought we would end up after tax -- including tax benefits that we ended up paying about 5x EBITDA at full run rate. So if you figure that a lot of that will come in, in '17. You'll have some bleed back into '18, of course. But by that time, we still feel like that's about the right number. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives. Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter. Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of our -- the best sales months in our history. Given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year. Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high-quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our Payments segment. We saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact. Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our Payments segment, which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, respectively. As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of 2016. We're on -- we're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including 8 of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking. And during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our long-standing client relationships with PNC Bank with $350 billion of assets, and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets. We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our BillMatrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers through a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer site, IDR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country. Payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition. Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium, to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose. Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remain at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contacts -- contactless card issuance. Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still on the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation, including inclusion in the InformationWeek elite 100 list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the payments.com Alexa Awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian Solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought. Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia, with assets of over AUD 830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked #1 in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv. To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art palm authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity. We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning our nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the U.S. Lastly, 8 new DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 3 with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year-to-date as compared to 11 in the same period last year. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year-to-date to $812 million. Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, over the prior-year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from our acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter. And for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. At the segment level, our Payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and Output Solutions including EMV, and solid growth in e-payments. As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved EMV personalization, we still lag manufacturing and as a result, deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue is up 10% year-to-date to $1.4 billion. We further extended existing relationships with our market-leading solutions, including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits, and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%. Importantly, as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day-to-day lives. Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million, and year-to-date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3%, and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well, and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into 2017. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees. For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due to -- primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction of termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create comparability issues, as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect stronger Financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33%, but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi. Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year's comparable rate of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%. Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results which we expect to improve by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first 6 months of the year. Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn it -- the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continue to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpin one of our best single month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year. Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year, and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payment solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy. Our Operational Effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our Data Center Optimization program. To date, we've combined 7 centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. That said, we did capture $17 million of saves in the quarter, and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year operational effectiveness goal of $40 million. Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw many crash in alternative lending as certain highfliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios. And while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant. Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-U.S. business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is incorporated in our full year outlook. We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees which, as Bob mentioned, is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3 given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our strong first half performance, along with anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45, which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year. We exit the first half of the year well-positioned to meet our current financial goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high-quality internal revenue growth. Before we go to Q&A, allow me to recognize the more than 22,000 associates who make a difference for our clients through innovation and excellence each and every day. With that, Carrie, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Based on some of your comments about organic growth biasing towards 5% for 2016 as a whole, how should we start to think about next year? And in particular, I'm thinking back to your Analyst Day from last year where you mapped out a 50 to 100 basis point target increase in organic growth over the long term. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Thanks, David. So first of all, we feel actually quite good about the trajectory of our growth rate. We believe that we will grow or expand our internal revenue growth rate in '16 over '15 within the 50 to 100 basis point range. But the encouraging news for us is that we expected -- we do expect to have much higher growth in the second half of the year, and we expect that to be the jumping-off point going into 2017. So we feel like we're on track. Our strategic initiatives are coming online. We had a little bit more lumpiness in our revenue this year than we're used to, but again, that doesn't affect our longer-term view. And we would expect to see our internal revenue growth rate continue to increase 50 to 100 basis points a year into the foreseeable future. David Togut : Do you have a pretty good line of sight as to how the EMV card personalization revenue deferral is going to roll into Q3 and Q4? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. David Togut : Got it. And then, you called out some nice growth in DNA implementations year-to-date. Can you talk about the general competitive environment in the large credit union space? You called out in the first quarter call a go live on the Vibrant Credit Union. I mean, how do you see the -- how do you see share trends going forward? Jeffery Yabuki : So we continue to have a very, very strong success with DNA on the larger end of the credit union space as well as on the larger end of the bank space. On the credit union side, we have continued to win substantially more than our fair share of competitive takeaways when we go up against anyone in the market. So our win-loss record is quite high going up against a prospect, so we do very well in that environment. And frankly, the Vibrant go-live was very important to us. As you know well, David, because you've known us for a long time, these tend to be longer tail sales processes and then longer tail implementations. With Vibrant going live just in Q1, that created a level of energy in the market, and we have confidence that, that will turn into additional conversations. And frankly, we would have an expectation that would turn into additional wins on the larger credit union end of the market. David Togut : Understood. And then, Jeff, your comments regarding the EMV growth runway. I think, you're probably the most bullish in terms of the length of the runway in which you can grow EMV-related revenue. Is there anything specific about your customer base on the card issuer side that, let's say, would give you a longer-term runway for growth? We're starting to see some managements caution that EMV benefit may be near an end, particularly Vantiv on their FI business. Mark Ernst : Togut, this is Mark -- or David, this is Mark. The key thing that I'd say that is different is because we are so much focused on debit, and debit has been later than a lot of the credit processors, we think that there's more runway left for us because of that bias. I'd say that's the biggest thing. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And I would also add to that, David, that we -- remember that we produce cards for a much larger group than just our issuer, kind of our debit issuer banks. And so we -- and much of that business, to Mark's point, is on the debit side. So not only do we have a fair runway in our own base but as well as all the other issuers that don't yet use our debit processing services. Operator : Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: Given the fairly steep back-half acceleration, can you help us think through kind of risk factors that might cause you to come in lower than where you think you're going to come in? Are you depending on implementations that can't get pushed back? Or how should we sort of assess the risk of what's to come here? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, that's a great question, Ramsey. So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients, as we've been talking about for the last several years. So that points the majority of the focus on the financial segment. And our out[ph] calculus, and we've looked at this a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year than we have historically seen, and it really comes down to a couple of factors, and let me lay them out. The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory, and we talked about in the first quarter some license-related revenue that was lumpy in our '15 numbers. And we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts. And therefore, we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue. And we would expect, as that lumpiness in the prior year went away, that we'll get some comparable benefit. The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this -- the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side, lending -- I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV, as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral but we've also seen very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2, so all of those, we believe, will provide benefit. The next item is you'll remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4, and it was actually primarily in December. Actually, December of 2015 was, by far, our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run 6, 9, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the Financial segment, so we're excited about that. And then, lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year are -- have either unusually short implementation cycle or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we sign them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then, lastly, just the compound effect again of our -- some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like. So we've got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it -- we've got them recorded and we've got our management routines focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, the -- I think, very importantly, is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that will sustain. It will give us, we think, very good -- a very good tailwind entering into '16. And then, when you combine that with the very good sale -- I mean, into '17, I'm sorry. When you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how '17 is starting to stack up. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That's super helpful. Another question I wanted to ask was about free cash flow. You'd mentioned there were a couple of puts and takes in terms of why it was, on an absolute basis, I think, relatively flat versus last year and not growing too fast on a per share basis. Can you visit that? For some reason, I was expecting the EMV revenue deferral to have a somewhat positive impact on cash flow but I might not be getting that correct. Could you go through again just sort of the cash flow dynamics and why you expect them -- what's been weighing on them and why they're going to pick up a little later in the year? Robert Hau : Yes, Ramsey, it's Bob. There really were the 2 key drivers that I talked about from a working capital standpoint in terms of accounts receivable as well as the timing of our tax payments, that's actually the bigger weighting on accounts receivable. And yes, you're right. The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over the last 4 quarters, down to only about $3 million this quarter, so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing, and in fact, we started to see that collection turn already in July. So those receivables have started to turn into cash already for the third quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just wanted to, I guess, clarify just, I guess, the bias to the 5%. It sounds like term fees is the biggest contributor to that? And then, I may have missed it, if that's the case, then how are you able to, I guess, upgrade your EPS target given that's a higher-margin component? Is it just mix or are you pulling some levers to get there? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Tien-tsin, you did hear that on the termination fees, and it is by far the largest single impacting item, I would say, or the unplanned item in our results -- or estimated results for '16. Obviously, it's kind of a mixed bag, right? On one hand, it's always better to not have termination fee revenue. On the other hand, termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins, as you note. You've probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our Operational Effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our full year target. And the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that -- the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees. So there is some benefit there. And frankly, as you know well, if you look at the sources of our growth being in the Payments segment, the Payments segment, I think, we mentioned in our remarks crossed over 34% for the first time ever. I mean, those -- that -- the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year and we're not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull. It just so happens that in some of the products, take Mobiliti, that we invested in several years ago, once you cross the line on that, the contributions are pretty attractive. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. So high incremental margins there. Makes sense. Just as a follow-up. Just Jeff, you commented about -- it sounds like your June, July are pretty strong from a sales perspective, despite what you called out, right, Brexit and out-lending stuff. So why do you think that's the case? What pulled through some of this strong selling because we've heard sort of mixed things around discretionary spend. It sounds like you're seeing good sales execution. Why is there a delta in your mind? Jeffery Yabuki : One of the -- it's really across 2 plains as best I can see. One is the majority of our larger sales are tending to be nondiscretionary. So it's using our BillMatrix platform to process payments for a very large -- one of the very large Blues where there's a very interesting dynamics going on in the health insurance, and therefore, the health payments industry, that we're just starting to play in. We've been farming that space for a couple of years. We mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the U.S., again, to use one of our payment acceptance platforms. And that, we talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our now strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers but being able to have issuers, consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem, you may have seen that we signed an arrangement with EWS, so again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the non-issuer side, that's working out quite well. On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So mobile, online -- online is getting an interesting wave of at least refreshed lookie-loos saying, \"Hey, I've got this really great mobile experience. What do I do with online?\" And then, some of our payments capabilities that are -- whether it's our IPS set of capabilities, account transfer, bill payment, which is still kind of, as I mentioned, the killer app of non-point-of-sale payments. Those are all the areas which we're getting focus and having good interest. And frankly, that's why our sales are good, but importantly, our pipeline continues to grow pretty precipitously. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : And I guess, first of all, you mentioned about 80 basis point headwind from some of the one-offs this quarter, low lower term fees, FX, EMV, the deferral there. Can you give us what that impact is on each of the segments? Jeffery Yabuki : We typically wouldn't do that. But EMV sits in Payments. And the others are generally, I think, in Financial. So I'm not exactly giving it to you, Dave, but that's the roundabout. David Koning : Yes. Okay. And then, I guess, secondly, for Q3, you mentioned the $15 million to $20 million term fee headwind, does that mean that Q3 -- the core, it sounds like the core of the full half -- the second half of the year is going to accelerate, but does Q3 get kind of pushed back down towards kind of the same growth as Q1 and Q2 given that roughly a little over 1% headwind to the business? And then, Q4 is where the real acceleration happens, right? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. That's -- I think that's a good way to think about it because of obviously the termination fees. Those termination fees, while they're not from the account processing businesses, they are sitting in that segment. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. David Koning : Okay. And then, I guess, just the last thing, the $26 million of acquisition benefit this quarter, is there any real seasonality there? Or is that a pretty good number, kind of the rest of the year, to think about the $26 million per quarter? Robert Hau : We think, Dave, overall, the acquisition benefit for the year is about 75 to 85, so about 25 a quarter. Of course, we acquired both those businesses kind of mid to latter part of first quarter, so minimal impact Q1, full benefit in Q2. Operator : Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on where the pipeline of DNA wins stand today. You talked about 8 new conversions coming on with the 3 over $1 billion. Can you maybe talk a little bit about -- and I think that the total pipeline has had a little over 20 as of last quarter. So have you resold that pipeline? And do you expect the remaining ones over $1 billion to come on before the year-end? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, we're optimistic, Jim, that we're always going to have a nice backlog of DNA wins. But we don't have any reason to believe that our expectation for go lives in the year has changed. I mean, we're moving that along. And again, as I mentioned to Dave's question earlier, interest in DNA continues to be very strong across all charter types, so we would -- from a pipeline perspective, we would expect that to continue to be additive. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then, with respect to the Operational Effectiveness program, you talked about the 70% attainment towards the $40 million target for the year. Is that something you would expect that you would kind of potentially pool future program savings into this year or would you plan to kind of get to that $40 million attainment and then just kind of stop and reset for 2017? And can you maybe talk about how much more there is to go on the data center side, specifically? Mark Ernst : So we are not -- we don't really manage it around the financials. We manage it to drive as much operational effectiveness as we can. The target that we have has specific programs attached to it. And those are all tracking well or better than we might have expected going into the year. But we don't moderate the pace of those around kind of how much is realized in any one given year. So no, we wouldn't slow that down. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say, Jim, I mean, to Mark's point, we -- in most years, we exceed our target by a bit, and that -- I would -- obviously, given where we are this year, we would expect that. On the data center piece itself, there's a lot of runway, right? As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, it's taken us a while to get some muscle and the cadence around it. We've gotten 7 so far completed year-to-date and we would expect that to continue to grow for the next several years. Ultimately, we're going to go down to a handful of larger data centers that we think will help deliver a better service to our clients and frankly, reduce our cost. So that's a meaningful opportunity moving forward. Robert Hau : And Jim, I'd just to remind you, we're in year 1 of a 5-year program that's got a $250 million 5-year objective for savings. So we're in the very early stages of 5 years of cost improvement. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Condra of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse. Paul Condra : Just a couple. First on the Early Warning, can you just talk a little more about what -- I guess, what Fiserv gets out of that arrangement? And anything about economics that work for you? Mark Ernst : Yes, so this is Mark. I mean, the arrangement, we're pretty excited about it. The Early Warning, as you probably know, is kind of really -- has picked up the clearXchange business, and they have been working on this development of a kind of large bank P2P network that their owners can all sign onto. What we announced today is that we will be a technology provider to offer our technology, our P2P technology, which includes lots of different kind of back-end services that would enable any financial institution in the country to participate in that network that EWS is going to be introducing. So in many ways, I think, we're really in the leading position to provide this turnkey technology that financial institutions in general will need. Now some of the larger banks that are --  that are owner-members of EWS have built of their own technology but an awful lot of other financial institutions. And certainly, as you go into the larger number of community institutions still rely on a technology provider like us to give them the back-end systems they need to participate in that kind of a network. Jeffery Yabuki : I would also say, Paul, I mean, part of this is we're in the early stages of understanding what it's all going to mean. Like many other service offerings, some banks will create -- some institutions will create their own P2P offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone else's and -- but many of them, we believe, will use all of ours. We've got roughly 2,400 institutions today in the U.S. that are using our Popmoney technology. And as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're op to a pretty solid cadence of a 30% transactional growth. Every quarter, we're announcing year-over-year growth kind of in that range. It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So 100 times 110 million households roughly in the U.S. that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronified and moved in a different way. And whether that is -- ends up being 5% or 10% or 50%, none of us really know, but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen. So ultimately, we think we'll drive transaction volume. We think there'll be network gateways, there'll be risk products. There'll be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain. And we've been in this for a while. We've got a nice footprint. Some clients will probably link to Early Warning but what we do know is with the 5,000 institutions that we provide core account processing for today, we think, will play an important role in serving them. And the 4,000 institutions that use our bill payment solution, including 8 of the top 10 banks in the U.S., will continue to operate with us. We think there's ultimately going to be quite an exciting and interesting payment ecosystem beyond point-of-sale that's created. Paul Condra : Yes. I mean, it sounds like there's a lot going on that kind of leads to my next question, which is as you're getting into these emerging areas, lending, mobile, you talked about biometrics and P2P. How does that feed into the way you're thinking about M&A? Do you have all the capabilities you need? Are there some assets out there that might make sense? Jeffery Yabuki : I think, any of us would be foolish to say we have all the assets that we need. We feel quite good that we've got the lion's share of what's necessary today but we will continue to be active reviewers of what's going on in the market and look for opportunities to improve our product set or our solution set to help drive value for our financial institution and nonfinancial institution clients. So we're active out there but we'll continue to be pragmatic and compare every allocation of capital to share repurchase, as we always do, and again, look for opportunities to get the tailwind of the macros whenever we can. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Darrin Peller : Just starting off quickly, just if you could help us understand what the normalized growth rate do you think would have been in the Financial segment if you can sort of address or adjust for all those items that affected this quarter just so we can help understand the normalized growth going forward? Jeffery Yabuki : I'm only pausing, Darrin, because I'm trying to think about -- we typically don't give much segment by segment guidance, but I would say that it would be measurable and probably we'll leave it at that. Darrin Peller : Okay. All right. Let me just follow then on a question that was asked before with your thoughts on what you have in terms of assets. I'm really just trying to understand, A, the competitive environment now, I mean, obviously, one of your biggest competitors has made a very large acquisition focusing on larger financial institutions. Has that led to a change at all in your area of focus around the core, or area of focus around some of the larger banks, some of the ancillary services you may provide some of the larger financials? And then, maybe a follow-on would be just on the M&A side again. I mean, you've talked a lot about international over the years being an opportunity, and yet, I think, we're still waiting to see if something actually happens on the M&A front there. So can you just update us on your thoughts around anything outside of the domestic market? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Darrin. So I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about talking about the guys who bought SunGard. And we don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets set and it's -- that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallel between, for example, what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. So strategically, that's not where we've elected or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model, but I don't think you'll see us do something like that. As it relates to the non-U.S. side of the market, the beauty of the U.S. market is it's a relatively singular large market. And there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India. And those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So the challenge for us is being -- we'd like to -- in some ways, have a larger non-U.S. footprint, but we want that non-U.S. footprint to have the high-quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital, both in and out of the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Nice win with the Early Warning. And Jeff, it sort of, I guess, dovetails into my bigger picture with regard to Mobiliti and Payments. The Payments segment's obviously performed very nicely. Can you quantify perhaps in your segment organic revenue growth the contribution from Mobiliti solutions in aggregate? And then, maybe the -- I know it's hard to quantify but maybe -- and it's early, perhaps frame up timing for contribution from the clearXchange solution? It -- I mean, is that a function of banks rolling it out? Is it a function of transaction volume on the platform? How should we think about that? Jeffery Yabuki : So let me -- I'll give it a shot, and Mark will fill in where I have missed. So I'm going to take the second one first. So we have ideas on how the rollout will go. I think, there's been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the P2P services for some of the larger institutions. We've seen that going on intermittently but there seems to be a lot of energy around that. And our experience, at least with services such as bill pay is when you think about them to consumers, they tend to want to start using them. So we would expect to see transactions start to grow as awareness is raised. And perhaps it won't be as -- the velocity won't be the same as Venmo. But frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be -- to come through as payment transaction volumes, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to best position their offerings, or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do. There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our bill pay technology but they embed it into an experience that's unique to them, and I think, we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think, it'll come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions, and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients, so a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end-to-end processing that we do overall. Mark Ernst : Yes, the only thing I'd add, as Jeff said, the volume of transactions is where we think this is ultimately going to -- why this might be different this time. And fundamentally, we've known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed -- it's coming from a trusted financial institution, that's why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business so hard, we think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize, and that's been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market. But very importantly, there's 2 other factors that I think is going to come through with this. One is the ubiquity of it. Being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find endpoints through much of the banking system is really where the promise of, we think, the EWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be, at its inception, a real-time network. And we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game-changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business. Jeffery Yabuki : Andrew, let me just move on to the other half of your question. We don't disclose what the size of the mobile or digital business on a stand-alone basis. We have, at our investor days, we have kind of put wheels out there that give the general sizing as typically part of our -- I think, it's part of our e-payments business but it's out there. It's a growing -- a rapidly growing piece of the business. The growth contributions are important. And we are -- I would actually venture to say we are even earlier in our mobile journey and our online transformation journey than we are in our EMV journey. And that is -- we have significant growth runway to go. Most of the pundits believe that we'll see, over the next 3 to 5 years, 70% to 80% of the -- of banking users be mobile, and that number for us is well, well, well south of that. So we feel quite good about that. And again, I would not underestimate the importance of remodeling the digital experience for online as well. So both of those, we think, are important. And then, we did do the little -- the ACI, the Community Financial Services acquisition early on. We're just starting to move those client institutions and ultimately, their customers into the mix. And we think there's a lot of value to be created there as well. Operator : Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Jeff, actually, your last question is a good segue into what I wanted to ask or clarify. As Mobiliti becomes more or less mainstream, and clearly, you have many development front-end products for that, should that not lower your cost structure over time because these channels are also inherently more self-service, more cloud-based? Is that already part of your operational effectiveness thought process? How should we think about the cost side implications of it? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. The answer is for the client institutions over time, when digital is scale, self-service is a much more important piece of the equation. And so I do believe that for the financial institutions, they'll see cost benefits. For us, the most important part of us getting cost benefits is scaling the platform. So the more scale we get in the platform, the lower our cost -- kind of a unit cost will get over time. Ashwin Shirvaikar : But you shouldn't -- you won't see lower support cost or anything like that? You're primarily benefiting from those [ph]? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, again, if you think about -- we supply these technologies to the financial institution, they're supplying them to their end customers. We will -- we take in -- if we have a core account processing client, we're providing them with support for any one of the 28 different applications that they have. I think, as humans get more dependent on self-service, it could have a derivative impact on us. But we haven't thought about that as a way of reducing our cost but I'll certainly have Bob take a look at that. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Bob, sorry to create work for you there. The other question I had was on pipeline. And I think, you may have answered part of it but just wanted to revisit. It seems like it took maybe 6 or 7 months to go from 1 sales peak last December to this July, if I can call this July sort of sales peak. Does that mean that you now have to again replenish for the next 1, 2 quarters in terms of what your sales is going to look like in the second half of the year? Jeffery Yabuki : I think, that, at least from our standpoint, one of the reasons why we're so bullish, both for our results this year but also moving into '17 is our pipeline, even with the very strong performance, the pipeline is quite robust right now. And it's not as geometric as we had a peak in December and a peak in July because, frankly, we did have a slower year last year. We had a very, very strong year in '14. We spent a good part of '15 replenishing the pipeline but not just replenishing it by adding in clients but really looking at our processes and building what we believe is a more sustainable engine for the future in ensuring that, that pipeline maintains at a higher level. I would actually say that we have more large transactions in our pipeline right now than -- even with our closes in July -- than we had at the same juncture last year. So the values and especially the kind of probability-weighted values are substantially better now than they were a year ago. And given some of the momentum that we're seeing, we would at least be optimistic that we would be in even better shape a year from now. Operator : Our last question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a couple of clarifications. If 3Q '16, if there's not going to really be an acceleration in internal revenue growth, I think that would suggest a bigger number in fourth quarter, maybe an 8% internal revenue growth in the fourth quarter to make it average out to 5% for the year. I just want to make sure that's true because you're also talking about that being the jumping-off point for '17. So that's quite -- 8% would be a quite higher growth rate than what we've seen in the past when we think about '17. So... Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I know, that's right. I mean, I can't speak to the exactness of the numbers but I would say that they're directionally correct. And one of the biggest swing factors though is the termination swing. So we're getting -- Bob, we mentioned in our remarks that we expected termination fee revenue to be down, call it $15 million, $20 million in Q3, but we expect to return to normal termination fee levels in Q4. So you have that kind of oddity that you have to, I think, normalize. But beyond that normalization, we always have a little seasonality in Q4. But I think, directionally, that's why we have a good amount of confidence when we think -- start thinking about how that translates to '17. Bryan Keane : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on free cash flow, I know it was flat kind of year-to-date. What does that look like then for -- by the time we get to the full year? Does that -- will free cash flow grow with adjusted earnings per share, which I think is expected to grow 13% to 15%? Will that catch up to grow with that kind of growth rate? Robert Hau : That's essentially the right way to think about it, Bryan. We'll see better growth in the second half of the year that will more closely approximate the growth in earnings per share. And as we pointed out in the opening comments, we expect to be more than $4.70 free cash flow to shares. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Bryan, I think, you know pretty well that typically, we're running a little bit better than operating earnings in our free cash flow and then we have the benefit of reduced share count. And Bob will probably reprimand me, but basically, in Q2, we had a receivable -- we had a billed-in receivable without any corresponding billed-in days and we also had kind of an unusually large tax payment. And those kinds of things, we would not expect to recur for the remainder of the year. So we would expect to be kind of generally back on track. Robert Hau : Correct. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, everyone, for taking time with us this afternoon. It's always a pleasure. If you have any follow-up, please be sure to conduct our Investor Relations group. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Ma'am, you may begin. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, including solid internal revenue growth, strong operating performance and excellent free cash flow, leading to another increase in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. As we previewed in our Q2 call, sales results in the quarter were very strong, coming in at 119% of quota, and for the second quarter on a row, 34% ahead of prior year's results. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with adjusted earnings per share up 11% and 15% in each period, respectively. Free cash flow per share through September was up a healthy 20% to $3.32. Increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second straight quarter reflects our strong operating performance. At the same time, the combination of implementation delays and bringing on new revenue, along with lower termination fees, have us reducing our revenue guidance for the full year. Although we're disappointed in the shortfall, we take comfort knowing that the primary revenue variances are timing related, a combination of signing new business and some product launch delays. We are confident these revenues will come online in 2017, which will contribute to our anticipated internal revenue growth step-up next year. Now let me provide an update on our progress against our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and last, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We remain committed to building high-quality revenue, which is at the core of our internal revenue growth acceleration strategy. Even with this year's revenue delays impacting internal revenue growth, we continue to see significant growth opportunities on the horizon. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year's Q3, which was one of our strongest margin quarters ever, but up 90 basis points sequentially, placing this quarter's results near the top of our best margin performances ever. The combination of high-quality revenue, strong adjusted operating margin and capital allocation discipline produced a 20% increase in free cash flow per share through the first 3 quarters of the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to see product demand across financial services in areas which enhance digital experiences. Along those lines, we signed a $20 billion bank to our CheckFree bill pay solution in the quarter. This Midwest institution made the decision to enrich their digital payments experience, resulting in a competitive takeaway for our market-leading bill payment solution. We were also pleased to welcome 5 new DNA clients during the quarter, which included Farm Credit Services of America. This institution, with $25 billion in assets, was focused on making a long-term decision based on modern technology and enhanced flexibility that could also be tailored to their unique business needs. We're excited about providing technology and services to this new category of specialized institutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 34% to nearly 5.2 million users compared to the prior year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the continuing importance of digital engagement between financial institutions and their customers. Mobiliti business also continued its growth, bringing nearly 30 clients live in the quarter and more than 30% sequential user growth. Earlier this week, the bank consortium, EWS, announced Zelle as the brand for its P2P service, which is scheduled to go live in early 2017. Together, we formed a partnership that, on its own, will enable real-time P2P transactions to over 80% of the deposit accounts in the U.S. Today, we support many of the 19 announced bank and credit union partners through Popmoney, and a number of these, including Ally Bank, Bank of the West and BECU, have already committed to access Zelle using our market-leading turnkey solution. In addition to broad network reach, clients selecting our offering can benefit from our proven P2P services, such as broadened credit risk management, settlement, reporting, analytics and directory management, many of which may also be utilized by institutions on an a la carte basis. We continue to believe strongly that a bank-centric P2P is a long-term winning solution, and with over 2,400 member institutions in our network, we expect to play an important role in spurring growth for this exciting new opportunity. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we mentioned Verifast, our advanced biometric authentication solution. Early interest continues to be strong and we've already signed 25 clients. One of our beta clients, Gesa Credit Union, has received the CUNA award for excellence in technology for their use of Verifast. In addition, Fiserv was recognized as the customer engagement category winner of the IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings Real Results for Gesa's rollout of Verifast as an innovation that creates meaningful and cutting-edge change in the FI space. We continue to focus energy on delivering solutions that meet the demands of rising consumer expectations. Along those lines, FCTI signed with Fiserv during the quarter to provide transaction processing for nearly 8,000 ATMs at 7-Eleven stores. In addition to direct card usage, FCTI has also enabled our award-winning CardFree Cash solution, which allows consumers to securely access their money using only a mobile phone. We're excited to partner with FCTI to bring value to their customers at the point of thought. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call, Q3's results were negatively impacted by a large reduction in termination fees. This $10 million headwind was a bit lower than anticipated due to some acceleration in termination fees from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year termination fees to remain below the 2015 level. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $429 million and is up 6% year-to-date to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.8% in the quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, but was down 30 basis points against the very difficult prior year compare. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 32.2%, primarily related to excellent Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by dilution from acquisitions earlier in the year. Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.14 in the quarter and is up 15% to $3.28 for the year-to-date. We are well on our way to our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Turning to our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and is 6% year-to-date. Payments segment revenue growth was led by Output Solutions, card services and electronic payments. EMV card personalization was strong in this quarter, leading to a less than $1 million deferral in Q3, continuing the declining deferral trend we experienced over the last several quarters. Adjusted revenue, which includes results from acquired businesses, was up 9% in the quarter to $701 million and is up 10% year-to-date to $2.1 billion. Debit transaction growth in the quarter trended up to the low double digits, and P2P transactions grew in the mid-30% range. Real-time transaction growth in the quarter was impressive, up more than 100% over the prior year period, led by growth in Popmoney instant transactions. New client growth in our Payments and Channels businesses has been solid, adding over 100 new debit clients, nearly 260 bill payment clients, and signing over 150 additional Mobiliti ASP clients through the end of September. Payments segment adjusted operating income growth was exceptional, increasing 12% in the quarter to $242 million and year-to-date is up 14% to $705 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 34.4% in the quarter, which is an all-time high, and up 140 basis points to 34.1% for the first 9 months of the year. Integration efforts at our acquired payments businesses are progressing well, and we expect more meaningful synergy benefits as we close out the year and roll into 2017. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $624 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion during the first 9 months of the year. Segment internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. But for the reduction in termination fee revenue, Financial segment growth would have been 3% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $209 million in the quarter and is $606 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points sequentially to 33.5% and down 200 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by the low termination fees, which was 120 basis points alone, and the timing of expenses such as incentives and our quarterly client conference. Along those lines, we continue to make meaningful incremental investments in some of our newer innovation solutions such as Agiliti. Corporate and Other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.8% in the quarter compared to 34.3% in the prior year period. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year. Free cash flow was up 12% to $747 million through September 30 and, importantly, free cash flow per share for that period is up a very strong 20% to $3.32. Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of September 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We remain disciplined in returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter, and we've returned more than $930 million in the first 9 months of the year. There were 217.8 million shares outstanding as of September 30, and 8.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, sales performance was outstanding in the quarter, coming in 34% ahead of last year and 119% of quota. Results were strong across several areas of the company, including card, biller, Output Solutions and bank solutions. Importantly, the results included several large payments-oriented transactions, which are an important driver of future revenue growth. We enter the fourth quarter at 100% of quota -- 101% of quota, a robust pipeline, and expect to meaningfully exceed last year's sales results, providing growth momentum entering 2017. Integrated sales were up 28% to $73 million in the quarter, up 11% sequentially and it increased 12% for the first 9 months of the year. We continue to see strong demand across our digital and payment solutions. We're experiencing excellent results across our Operational Effectiveness initiatives, having achieved $44 million of savings through the end of September, already eclipsing our $40 million goal for the full year. We've combined 15 data centers this year, including one of the largest locations. Delivering increases in efficiency enhances our ability to invest in future growth and sustainably expand operating margin. The environment in the quarter remained generally stable, with clients focused on driving revenue, the evolution of the digital consumer and the need to balance investment with cost controls. Real-time money movement remains a key topic, both in the construction of the rail itself as well as the use cases which will leverage these capabilities such as Zelle. We expect to play an important role in this evolution by providing a number of solutions that will utilize these real-time services. Solutions such as NOW, which are designed to enhance ubiquity around these services, position us well in the evolving payments landscape. Turning to guidance, we expect to achieve record operating performance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow per share for the year. The fact that we can deliver these strong results, even as the timing of revenue and lower termination fees have moderated our in-year internal revenue growth expectations, shows the strength and resilience of our business model. We now expect full year internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 4.5%, which includes higher growth in Q4. We are well positioned for internal revenue growth acceleration as we head into '17. We have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.43 to $4.46, which is $0.11 per share higher on the bottom end of the range than our original guidance or 14% to 15% growth for the full year. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, which includes the margin dilution from the 2 acquisitions completed earlier in the year and lower termination fee revenue. And importantly, we expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year. We enter the fourth quarter with sales momentum and a platform of solid financial results. We continue to perform within our long-term outlook and are committed to driving a sustainable and steady increase in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years. During the quarter, we were fortunate to celebrate our 30th year as a public company. Over that period, Fiserv has produced a cumulative return to shareholders of more than 17,000%. This success is a byproduct of the stellar efforts of our more than 22,000 associates and all those who came before to deliver differentiated value to our clients each and every day. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Koning from Baird. Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about your -- the leverage of margin expansion in the first quarter. You've shown 20 bps of expansion year-to-date. You're looking for another 30 in the fourth quarter to kind of get to your guidance. I guess I'm trying to understand whether this is just -- that the margin expansion will come with growth acceleration from just scale efficiency? Or would you have other levers to get there in case the top line ends up not materializing the way you expected? Robert Hau : Yes, Ramsey, it's Bob. I think there's a couple of things to think about. First, on a year-to-date basis, we're at 32.2% operating margin, which is actually 50 basis points above where we finished last year already. So if we can hold that again, we'll achieve that 50 basis points margin expansion. And if you look at what happened in Q3 relative to what we expect for Q4, there's a number of expenses that impacted us in Q4 of last year that were timing related. And so we saw things like some incentive compensation, commissions, our fall forum actually fell into fourth quarter of last year versus third quarter of this year, so pure timing on that standpoint. And so as we enter in the fourth quarter, we've got a little bit of an easier compare, and we're confident we'll deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion on a full year basis. Jeffery Yabuki : And Ramsey, you said first quarter, but I think you meant third. And just on a broader perspective, and we have said for a long time and we continue to subscribe to the theory that the real benefit that the operational efficiency programs that we have, where over the last, I guess, nearly 10 years now, we've taken out over $0.5 billion of costs, is that gives us an opportunity to both, we think, support the model of increasing operating margin, but more importantly, gives us the opportunity to invest in innovation, growth and experiences that are just increasingly important in the world today. And we have the ability to moderate those investments on the basis of how we see take-up going in the market. And so we view this as an important level of flexibility and, frankly, as a driver to the strength and resilience of our operating model. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That makes a lot of sense. I also was wondering if you could comment on the way that sort of P2P environment seems to be kind of coalescing around this -- I know you sort of mentioned the bank-centric model with maybe the sort of clearXchange example, versus Venmo on the other side of things. I mean, is it something where it's an either/or for you guys? Or could you potentially get involved or facilitate P2P with different players in the industry no matter how it sort of evolves? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, let me start, Ramsey, and perhaps Mark Ernst will add to it. So we -- our sole objective is to do the right thing for our bank clients, and bank being -- representing all, really, financial institution clients. And so we have spent the last several years putting together what we think is the best turnkey solution in the market, end-to-end, everything from the user experience to the registry to settlement and recon, and payment speed, so we're happy about that. As we talked about in the discussion, we believe any number of the banks in the market will use our solution to either brand it as Zelle or Popmoney, and we'll see how that evolves over time. And I do believe that there is room for multiple payment networks in the market if that's what the market so demands. And so the opportunities -- if our clients want us to peer with a Venmo or something like that, then we would obviously investigate that. And if that made sense, then we would pursue that. Now again, that said, we do believe strongly, very strongly that a financial institution-centric model is the right model to allow the ubiquity that's necessary to move money when and where people want it. But Mark, I don't... Mark Ernst : Yes, the only thing I'd add to that is I think it's an underappreciated aspect of this whole kind of service how important things like risk management or settlement or identity management, any number of aspects of the service that is required in order to make it work, how important those are. And as Jeff talked about kind of our development over the last several years of really building out this kind of end-to-end capability, I think as people are now taking up the interest in this market, the demands that are on the back office side of this are becoming better appreciated. And that's why we're finding a lot of people very interested in partnering with us regardless of which network solution they're really looking to serve. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. Really quickly and lastly for me, you mentioned debit transaction trended up to low double digits. I was just wondering if there are any particular drivers to call out there? Mark Ernst : Sales growth. I mean, we've had good success just with bringing on more and more clients. Ramsey El-Assal: New deals? Okay. Jeffery Yabuki : Again, we -- one of the magical elements of our model is we're able to deliver these broad suites of solutions, and we've just continued to have momentum. And we've also done some interesting work at the intersection of digital experience and card transactions, which we believe we're seeing the early benefits of that. But over the next several years, we think that intersection will be quite valuable for both banks and their customers. So there's probably a little bit of innovation at that intersection included in those results. Operator : Our next question is from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Good to see you were able to raise earnings guidance despite the shortfall in organic revenue growth. Can you kind of give us your thoughts on fourth quarter? And then fourth quarter is the jumping-off point for 2017 organic revenue growth given the sales performance you've had to date and the visibility you have on implementation of new contracts? Jeffery Yabuki : So when you say fourth quarter, are you talking about what are the drivers to the acceleration? David Togut : Yes. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So we see a couple of things. We see, obviously, the sales. We had a slow start to sales in the year and that's ramped up in Q2 and Q3, and we expect to see that. We had a $10 million headwind from termination fee revenue in Q3, which we don't believe will recur again in Q4. And then some of the newer solutions that we have been talking about have been pushed during the year, and we'll start to see them come online into Q4. And then some of the normal cyclicality that we would expect to see in Q4 in our business, whether it be in the card and statement area, license revenue, those kinds of things. David Togut : Understood. And Jeff, you called out a $20 million -- $20 billion asset bank as a new customer in the bill pay business. I'm wondering, more broadly, are you seeing an increasing propensity by large banks to outsource in this environment given the pressure on NIM and higher regulatory and compliance spending? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we are seeing that. And David, we, the industry, have been talking about this for a few years. We are seeing that, but one of the areas in which we're seeing it more recently are in the areas of digital experience, where institutions sometimes are finding it difficult to keep up. We have had tremendous interest in our CheckFree RXP solution set this year as banks believe that, that remains the killer app, whether it's accessing online or mobile. And then the services themselves, we're seeing some larger institutions say -- or examine the opportunity to outsource even that, where, frankly, 3 or 4 years ago, a large institution outsourcing their digital experience just wouldn't have happened. So we are seeing some interesting movement in those spaces. And frankly, one of the, again, byproducts of something like Zelle is it's just pushing the digital capabilities, payments and money movement, making them front and center both on the business and commercial side of the bank. David Togut : Understood. Just shifting gears to the smaller FIs, could you comment on DNA bookings or sales in the third quarter? And any thoughts on the pipeline for DNA? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So we had 5 DNA wins in the quarter, of which one of them was a $25 billion bank that we referenced in the prepared remarks. We are seeing -- continuing to see very, very strong interest in DNA. But I will also say that what's intriguing, David, is the interest that we're seeing in DNA brings us -- brings more than just DNA to the forefront. So there may be a bank that's -- a bank or a credit union that's interested in DNA, it may turn out that they don't want all that complexity and they want a simpler solution, and we have other alternatives there. Plus, of course, it has the benefit of driving the broader bundles of value. But we continue to have fantastic momentum with DNA. And I would be -- the pipeline is pretty strong, and I believe that we'll have a superior DNA sales year next year even to the reasonably strong year we're having this year. As we see more of our clients that have now been live for a period of time, they're adding capabilities. We're making meaningful investments in DNA to ensure that, that platform continues to have a very strong role in the market. So all in all, I would say we're in very good shape there. David Togut : Good to hear. Just a quick final question for me. I was glad to hear the EMV personalization revenue picked up in Q3. What are your thoughts on how far along you are with EMV reissuance from magstripe to chip? And any granularity you could give on credit v. debit would be helpful. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So we're actually making good progress. I would say that we're probably a bit ahead on reissue this year. Let me say it a different way. We're a bit ahead on card manufacturing so far than we thought we would be. We're still waiting to see how personalizations ends up shaking out. We don't expect to have the amount of deferral next year that we had this year. But we're so new right now, David, that we're wanting to learn that and examine it. Remember, the substantial majority of our base is debit, and so we don't do a lot of credit card production. So we're -- the credit -- most of the credit cards have been reissued, but debit still is in the stages where we're watching the trends and trying to see how they develop. Mark Ernst : Maybe the only thing I'd add is prepaid is still kind of -- is going nowhere. So... Jeffery Yabuki : We did -- we were pretty excited, though, David. One thing I would say is we had our first large institution issue contactless in the quarter, and we're pretty bullish on what contactless will eventually mean in terms of our business and, frankly, the digital experience. So that's something that we're going to be watching as well. David Togut : And when does contactless really get going from a revenue standpoint? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I think the question is when does content contactless get going? And that is probably a ways off. But there are some institutions who have said we're going to bypass straight EMV and go right to contactless because the use cases are compelling. And for those people who have traveled outside the U.S., contactless is just a far easier, better, quicker experience. So there are some of the big transit systems are moving to contactless over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months, depending on if they stay on schedule, and things like that will start to make a big difference. Operator : Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I just wanted to dig into the implementation delays. How much of that would you call macro-driven type delays versus just -- I think you said product push or product delays were also part of the explanation there? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so Tien-tsin, let me give it a start, and then Bob and Mark can kind of add in as necessary. So we really had 2 types of delays that caused us to moderate our revenue expectation really for Q4, and that is we had some pretty large payments-oriented transactions that are nonfinancial institutions where the implementations pushed from Q3 to now to '17. It's not a macro at all. It's really about the partnership between a new client and us, and we're highly confident that, that will go live in the early part of '17. We had a couple of those kinds of things. And then I would say the other area is several of the solutions that we have been putting into the market, some of the newer solutions have been either delayed because it took us longer to get it into the market or it's been delayed because it's taken the banks longer to make those products available to their end customers, and we get paid on a click or a usage basis. So those 2 delays combined are the implementation delays that we were talking about here. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood. So no -- so nothing really macro driven or cancellations or surprise attritions to call out? Jeffery Yabuki : Not on all. Not at all. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. No, I guess I'm asking because I'm just trying to think as we sort of form our expectations for next year, why wouldn't -- or could we assume that you could grow faster than your prior 5% to 6% target, assuming there's a catch-up from these implementations? Sounds like you're pretty confident they'll come in to '17, plus you've got the big sales backlog that you've been referring to all year. Can you comment on that? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Just for the record, though, it's all year since the second quarter because the first quarter was pretty slow from a sales perspective. Tien- Tsin Huang : Right. You did say a slow start for [indiscernible]. Jeffery Yabuki : Bob put the big sign up, Tien-tsin. He wanted to make sure I said that. But I don't see us doubling up on the revenue next year, and the reason why is this is all recurring-oriented revenue. And so the revenue really only comes in on the basis of the elapsed time. So the revenue that we didn't get this year, while we have a high degree of certainty it'll come on in '17, we don't get 17 months of that revenue in a 12-month period. Now for the optimist in us, I mean, we'll get it at the very end of the contract, but it doesn't double up in the following year. That doesn't mean that we won't -- we like our momentum going into '17, with the number of -- the good sales successes we're having there, but I also want to make sure that we don't let anyone get ahead. We're sitting here in October, we feel good about acceleration, we feel good that we're -- we'll be back on track, but I wouldn't be giving guidance at this stage. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Christopher Shutler : On the second issue that caused the -- I guess, the guidance reduction, some of the newer solutions that were delayed or took longer to get into market, just could you flesh out that point a little bit more, Jeff? What were the specific products? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, I mean, unfortunately, there were several. But some of the headline products would've been IPS, Notifi, CardValet, a couple of products that are -- all these products are transactionally based, and it either took us longer to get into -- to get the GA, to get to general availability, or it took us longer -- and in some cases \"and\" -- it took us longer to put it into release and then to have the banks adopt it, and then to push it to their customers. One of the things that we did not anticipate, and we've now learned from it, is that once some of these products are in market, the banks don't necessarily make it available, or even in some cases, where users of the technology have to update -- something as simple as updating their apps to get access to the new functionality, it takes a little bit longer than we thought. Now that's a discrete example. There's just a group of solutions like that where we just have had more breaks against us than for us. Christopher Shutler : Okay. And then for 2017, just so -- maybe level set for all of us. Can you just walk us through the reasons why revenue growth will accelerate, maybe in order of magnitude, and what potential pitfalls you could see? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I would first say, Chris, that we're not giving guidance, right, we're trying to give a little bit of a calculus to it. Christopher Shutler : Understood. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say, number one, it's the implementation of the large transactions that we were talking about that were delayed in '16. Number two, it's really around the new sales. Remember that we had a fairly weak 2015 with a weak Q1. So we really had 5 quarters of weeks -- weaker-than-we-expected sales. We had -- the last 2 quarters were up 34% each, and we're expecting to have a reasonably strong Q4. So the cumulative effect of that, we believe, will provide a growth lift. The third item is really around these new products, where we're talking about the launches and go lives. We'll see some aggregate cumulative effect of those products which are in the market. In many cases, these products are sold already, so we don't have to sell them. We just have to deliver them into the market. So that's the third item. Fourth, I would say is just some continuing success around adoption of some of the products, i.e. Mobiliti. We continue to make progress there, whether it's on the consumer side or on the retail side. And then maybe the last one would be we aren't expecting any meaningful EMV deferral this year. So the turnaround on that will hopefully benefit us as well. So those are 4 or 5 items that I think at least give me confidence that we'll see the step-up on top of just the normal transactional growth that we're seeing, whether it's a little bit higher in debit and those kinds of things. Christopher Shutler : Got it, okay. And then lastly, just what has driven the stronger sales over the last 2 quarters? I mean, have there been changes to the sales organization incentive structure, et cetera? And just trying to gauge sustainability there. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So it is -- we did actually make some changes to our sales structure. Specifically, in our digital and payment areas, we've made some changes. We didn't feel like we were moving fast enough in those areas. And again, one of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks, Chris, is that as banks look to really try to differentiate at the point of digital experience, which is currently the handheld device, the mobile device, we're seeing some nice wins and a lot of energy in the digital and payments area. And those are -- tend to be larger transactions. So that has been one of the areas. We also -- we've also introduced a couple of new products. We've introduced something called BillMatrix Next, which is on the -- in the biller side of the business where we've had some fair success this year. Traditionally, we have been focused on the unregistered side of payments. This allows us to have an all-in registered, unregistered, let us handle all of your payments from e-bill all the way to payment acceptance and reconciliation. And this product is getting some nice attention out there. That actually came -- some of those capabilities came from our acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay platform. So that's an example of some of the new products that are out there. And then I would say, lastly, it's really -- it has really been about focus. I think we had -- '13 and '14 were big record-year-on-record-year and we probably didn't put just enough focus on that. We've been very focused around making sure that not only are we winning more deals but that they are larger deals. And frankly, Mark Ernst has put a tremendous amount of energy on ensuring not are we just winning deals, but that the pipeline -- the pipelines are strong. So we're going to enter '17 with a much stronger pipeline than we had going into the prior year even with a much better sales result. So it's a combination of factors but things that we want to -- we believe we've learned from and will benefit us again in '17. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : It sounds like some of the new growth initiatives were a little bit slower than expected in '16 due to some of the issues you pointed out. So I guess I'm wondering what gives you confidence to get back on track in 2017. And are the product delays you mentioned obviously largely behind you? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say we've learned from what happened this year. We feel like some of the products that were delayed, we don't believe they're going to be re-delayed, so we're in good shape there. In fact, a couple of them -- a couple of the bigger ones will be launched in Q4, so we're feeling good about that. Just too late -- because they're transactional, it's too late to really impact the revenue much. And then on some of the -- frankly, on some of the products where we've been stuck a little bit between the intermediary and the recognition of the revenue, we saw that happening earlier in the year, and so we've been working on ways to remediate that. I don't think it will be perfect, but it gives us confidence -- the steps that we're taking right now give us confidence that we will have revenue -- internal revenue growth acceleration in '17 over the '16 level, which puts us back on track. Robert Hau : John, what I'm going to add is something Jeff said earlier, is that in many cases, these products that are now getting into market have sales against them. So it's not a matter of getting them to market and then tuning up sales. We have sales activity already. Joseph Foresi : Got it. So you're not changing your overall outlook for the business. It's just the timing? Just to be clear. Robert Hau : That's right. Very specifically around the timing. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And just one other question for me. Is the overall type of businesses you're seeing in the pipeline, are they different than -- or the type of business is different than you've seen in the past? Have conversion rates changed at all? I'm just wondering, with all this new digital business coming in the door, is there faster or slower conversion rates, and can the timing shift a lot more than what you've seen historically? Mark Ernst : Yes. This is Mark. I think we're seeing the timing be a little bit slower than what we may have seen historically. But we're actually seeing our conversion rates ticking up very nicely this year. And on average, we're doing bigger deals this year. And that is really kind of the tailwind of beginning focus that we had starting in 2015, frankly, of getting very focused on building pipeline, understanding what's in that pipeline and then maturing those deals. But larger deals, which is part of the reason we're seeing better sales results this year, also take longer to accomplish. So you're seeing kind of the success now of a strategy that was put in place well over a year ago. Jeffery Yabuki : And part of why we like the robustness of our pipeline right now is it has a good smattering of the larger deals which will close, hopefully, in both Q4 but also in Q1 to give us a little bit of a bigger start. One of the biggest issues we called out in '15 is the number of sales we had was generally consistent, but the -- we did not have the typical preponderance of the larger transactions. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Darrin Peller : Just to be clear, I mean, you're saying acceleration into '17. That's, I guess, off the new base though, right, just to be safe in our modeling. Off the 4% to 4.5% is how we should think about that, not off the previous base of growth of 5-plus percent? Jeffery Yabuki : That's correct. I mean, Darrin, as you know well, given our model and the nature of the revenue, with so much of it being recurring, it's very difficult for us to jump more than that 50 to 100 basis points in a year. Darrin Peller : Okay. Make sense. All right. And then just a follow-up on the operational efficiency goals. You've done well, obviously, ahead of your goal for the year. Just for modeling out the rest of the year, and I guess in line with your margin guidance, I mean, should we assume that there is more to go there? I mean, can you give us some examples of what may be some other opportunities on that? And really going forward, I mean, is there still plenty of room on that front? Robert Hau : Yes, Darrin, as you know, we're is in the first year of a 5-year program expected to save $250 million. We anticipated this first year of that 5-year program to be a little bit slower, particularly because a portion of that savings is associated with our data center consolidations, and that takes time to ramp up. What we've seen is some nice progress there, but also around labor optimization and our procurement savings. So as we pointed out in our opening comments, we're $44 million into a $40 million full year target, and we certainly aren't stopping in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to progress and make progress against that 5-year goal of $250 million. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's helpful. Just -- I guess Jeff, just high level now, if you don't mind. I'm trying to figure out kind of the demand in the environment. I know that you had a lot going on, and you've had good sales pipe over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a little more color specifically on what you're seeing, maybe by size of bank or by some of your horizontal offerings in terms of which are really -- there's demand, inbound requests from your clients for -- versus areas that might have slowed down? I mean, we're hearing a lot from banks that have said they expected interest rate hikes earlier in the year that never came, so discretionary spending may not have been as strong. Any evidence of that? Or it's generally your offerings, obviously, showing good sales growth the last couple of quarters? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Yes, sure, Darrin. I mean, I would say -- let me give it a shot. Mark can add in. Make no mistake, discretionary spending is not -- is being managed and moderated. There's no question about that, in terms of banks are absolutely focused on where they're spending money. And frankly, in many cases, banks are slowing spending down in certain areas of the bank and trading it off to be able to invest in the areas that are the most meaningful right now. And those areas are tending to be around digital experience, they tend to be around payments, commercial services for banks, and risk and fraud compliance. I mean, those areas are critically important. We are -- fortunately, many of the investments that we've been making over the last several years happened to be in those areas. That, combined with the fact that we have products like CheckFree, which are clearly at the center of digital experience, we're the beneficiary of a little bit of excess demand in those areas. I'm sure there are some areas that we are not seeing the same kind of growth, but they're -- from a sales perspective, they're more than offset by the level of activity we're seeing out here. And that's really across all-sized institutions, the very largest -- we had -- at least, I can think of one transaction this year that we've had that I would not have anticipated, and it's really all because of -- large transaction all because of the digital -- kind of the focus on digital experience by the largest banks. Mark Ernst : The only thing I'd add to that is when you think about the -- okay, so if that's the case, where's the offset to that? The one thing that we are seeing in the industry is less churn in core processing. And that's a double-edged sword for us because we'd like to see more of that coming our way. On the other hand, we are a beneficiary of that because we have such a large installed base. But that's probably the place where you see less activity than what we would've seen 2, 3, 4 years ago. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Sorry to belabor the point on the whole discretionary spending topic versus the reviews for the revenue shortfall. But can you maybe just give us a little bit of color of -- on the discretionary spending, do you feel like that took a lot of potential upside off the table in addition to the kind of product and customer-specific things you mentioned before? In other words, did you see that deteriorate over the past couple of quarters? And do you think that was also a kind of a contributor to the revenue in the current year or not? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say, on balance, not, because we have such a broad set of solutions. But I will tell you that there is a little bit of a nuance that's probably important to mention along these lines. We are seeing a bit of a shift from some of the license sales over to recurring revenue sales. So especially in the area of cross-sell, where we are -- because we have such a large installed base and we're the primary technology provider, we build a lot of products. Some of those products are license add-ons, and some of those products are recurring revenue that takes time to get lined up. And we are seeing more of the products move to the recurring revenue, and there is a longer implementation cycle on those kinds of things. So where we are building product, the product that we're building, that, we're seeing more in those areas. Again, Jim, I'm sure that there are some areas within the company where the level of discretionary spending is hitting us, but I would not be able to call out that, that is a primary issue of any shortfall that we're having this year. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then just maybe following up on the comments around Zelle and Popmoney. I think I got it right. You support 19 Popmoney clients now. You signed up 4 with Zelle so far. Can you maybe just talk about whether there is any transition that we could expect to see between the time that some of your clients -- or existing Popmoney clients maybe phase-out Popmoney and are not live on Zelle yet? I mean, is there any potential for kind of a pothole in revenue, understanding that's not a particularly big contributor, as you get them to ramped to Zelle? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Jim, let me try to clarify some of the comments to make sure that we get the kind of P2P by the numbers right. Today, we serve about 2,400 institutions with Popmoney, not including a reasonable backlog of clients that still need to go live. There are 19 clients -- 19 financial institutions who have indicated that they're going to brand a P2P service as Zelle. Of those 19, many of those are our clients for Popmoney today. A few of them granted us permission to use their name in our prepared remarks because they're going to be using our turnkey solution a la Popmoney re-branded as Zelle. We believe that the majority -- the substantial majority of the clients that are in the Popmoney network today will continue to access our technology because we have the only full-featured end-to-end P2P bank-centric technology in the U.S., the only one. And so from that perspective, we may have people brand as Zelle. There may be -- there will be a number of clients that are branded as Popmoney. Just like you can have a debit network with EXL or a debit network with Interlink. You can -- there are different networks that are out there. But at least for the foreseeable future, we're going to be the provider of many of those services. And we actually believe that our revenue from Popmoney, if the clearXchange folks are right, and we believe that, that approach is the right approach, that that's going to actually expedite substantially bank-centric P2P, and that we would expect to see a benefit from that in our numbers beginning next year and moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Moshe Katri : Just again, for reference. Obviously, there's a lot of focus on -- in the market around the macro headwinds. If you look at your revenue base today, can you just remind us which part of it is recurring? And then which part of that revenue base is potentially susceptible to any sort of macro volatility, just to put this into context of some of the discussion points during the call? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, sure. So let me give you -- and these are going to be approximations, and they're really going to be based on our -- the last Investor Day we did, which was midyear '15. And we'll do another one in '17, and we'll certainly supply some additional information. On balance, I think we indicated roughly 88% of our revenue was categorized as recurring at that point. The remaining 12% is split between services -- nonrecurring services revenue, license revenue, and then some odds and ends. But that -- it's really 88% and 12% is roughly the cut that we used last time. Moshe Katri : And just again, going back, has that changed throughout -- during the past few years? Has that kind of changed -- has that kind of remained steady or stable? Jeffery Yabuki : I don't have the data in front of me, but my gut says that it has increased. Mark Ernst : Yes. It's more recurring today than it has historically been. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, you make a -- what I think is a really important assertion regarding the nature of mobile, I think, generally, but C2C in particular, namely the idea that you think the prevailing model will be bank centric. And I know going back over the years with bill pay, there was a discussion of bank-centric versus biller-direct offerings, and I think the market may be split down in the middle. What do you think about -- what exactly drives your conviction that banks versus a Venmo, for example, will ultimately prevail and to Fiserv's benefit? Jeffery Yabuki : So I believe, notwithstanding the fact that Venmo has incredible word-of-mouth and has really grown tremendously, the majority of the U.S. prefers to do financial transactions with their regulated financial institution. And therefore, if you look at all of the use cases that are available to P2P -- I mean, the use cases that we see most often in Venmo are use cases that are around really repaying money or paying money from one person to another, not necessarily for services but for advances and splitting checks and things like that. The substantial majority of the person-to-person transactions that happen in the U.S. today are everything from that use case but paying your babysitter and paying a dog walker and paying a component of rent. I mean, there are many, many use cases that tend to look more like a derivative of bill pay than they do here -- passing $5 or $10 or $20 from person A to person B. That's real estate that the banks tend to own historically. And my conviction is really based on the fact that I believe that ultimately, money movement is something that will need to be done in a safe and secure environment. And today, the bank-centric system is really the only safe and secure system that exists. And as we move to a real-time rail, I think that will actually become more important. Now that said, I do believe that there will be opportunities for bank centric to peer with non-bank centric and, ultimately, you'll have a different kind of world. But in the long run, I would expect bank centric to win or prevail. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, Okay. That helps. And one quick one. Just generally, as you talk about DNA and share wins and recognizing that you signed some big credit unions, when you think about sort of average credit unions -- average in size, I mean, any change in sort of the economic or margin environment as you take share? I guess I'm asking a competitive and pricing question. Jeffery Yabuki : So I would say that, to Mark's point that he made a few moments ago, there are generally less switches today than there were 3, 4 years ago. There are many less de novo institutions than there were 3, 4 years ago. And so in that context, you're going to have a more competitive environment. And I would say that the market dynamics tend to reflect that. Again, from our perspective, and I think most of the competitors in this market, they're selling a more bundled solution. And so there are pretty large -- there's large movement of technology platforms that are occurring. We are seeing, in the places where we would expect, pricing has held up. In the places that are -- get closer to commodity, right, prices don't tend to hold up quite as well. It's not so much the size of the institution as it is the competitiveness of the underlying market. Operator : Our last question at this time is from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So I wanted to go back to sort of the various sources of revenue weakness that you've highlighted, and was wondering if you could size the relative impact of each of those. Jeffery Yabuki : We -- of course, Ashwin, you would be surprised if we said we could not, so you know we can, but we're not going to go into it here. We're going to say that we think, in the aggregate, it was enough to cause us to moderate our in-year growth expectation, and we expect that it will end up reversing next year. I think Bob did, in his prepared remarks, talk about the fact the termination fee reduction was $10 million through the end of the third quarter, but that's the only sizing that we're going to provide at this point. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. And just looking at your sales success which, on a full year basis or a trailing 12-month basis, typically is -- it's fairly spectacular versus your revenue growth, where you've tended to, over time, have challenges with regards to being, let's say, at the upper end of a guidance that you provide. Clearly, the lumpiness of sales growth makes it difficult to translate that to revenue growth, but are there sort of annualized metrics or anything like that, that you can provide to give investors sort of a level of confidence that the sales growth that you're seeing will eventually translate into a certain level of revenue growth? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, that's a great question, Ashwin. I would say it is difficult because we tend to measure our sales in total contract value as our primary metric, and we look at annual contract value as a secondary metric, and impact revenue as a tertiary metric. And so we're -- there are many of those metrics that we look at that we're not communicating externally. I would say that it's probably not a coincidence that we had record sales in '12, '13 and '14, and we had an easier growth journey in '13, '14 and '15, where, in '15, sales were not as strong as we liked and we had quite a soft start to this year. So when you add all that together, it's clearly important. And in each of the last 2 Investor Days, we've provided statistics on how our top deals turn into revenue. And it shows that there's a -- it can be anywhere from a 12- to 18-month average turn to revenue. So from that perspective, that's not a bad way to look at it. I would also say that this year, we've had some deals, specifically in the nonfinancial institution space, that we do expect to turn to revenue quicker, which is also going to help us. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And last question with regards to the use cases that you expect on Zelle. If I think of it broadly as normal P2P versus things like disbursements, maybe you could go into payroll, things like that. And the reason I'm making that distinction is because it's not clear to me, regardless of whether something -- whether to please banks and take or not take [ph] -- that you could actually charge for it. But maybe you can charge for disbursements. Do you have, I mean, sort of a prognosis of where we are headed with the types of products that can come out because of having Zelle as sort of a multibank consortium? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, that's probably a longer question than we can go through here. I would say that there's a difference between the financial institution to their customer monetization versus us as the builder and supplier of the technology and our ability to monetize that technology. But I would tend to agree with you that the P2P monetization is going to be difficult. And I do think disbursements, it could be quite a lucrative potential use case. But I think that's one of the areas we'll probably cover at our Investor Day next year. Thanks, Ashwin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a nice evening. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephanie Gregor, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Thank you. Stephanie Gregor : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-over-year metrics. Also, please note that we will hold our Investor Day on June 20 in New York City. Please watch your inbox for additional information. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon. We punctuated 2016 with 16% adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, led by our domestic businesses, which performed in line with our expectations, offset by a revenue miss in our international operations. Adjusted operating margin, free cash flow and sales results were all strong in the quarter. We extended our double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth to 31 consecutive years by registering 14% growth for the full year. Internal revenue growth was 4% for the year, led by strong performance in our Payments segment. Adjusted operating margin for the year was up 50 basis points to 32.2%, which is even more impressive when considering the margin headwind from acquisitions during the year. We achieved record free cash flow in 2016 of $1.1 billion, which translated to a 14% per share increase to $4.84. Sales performance was also a major highlight, increasing 21% over the prior year. Let me summarize our progress for each of you against our 2016 key shareholder priorities, which were : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payments solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to add high-quality revenue to our book of business even as our 4% internal revenue growth was below our initial guidance. Our 2016 performance was led by Payments segment internal revenue growth of 6%, which included strong results across a number of our businesses. As we noted in Q3's call, full year results would be impacted by the timing of revenue, primarily from implementation and product delays, which, as I mentioned, was further compounded by a Q4 revenue shortfall in our international business. We believe our strong sales for the year, combined with the benefit of client and product implementations coming online, support a step up in our internal revenue growth rate in 2017. Company-wide adjusted operating margin expanded for the fourth consecutive year. The combination of gains in high-quality recurring revenue combined with our strong operational effectiveness performance led to a 50 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin for the year. Importantly, this increased performance has been achieved organically as our recent acquisitions have actually been margin-dilutive, which we expect will improve as we integrate and scale these new solutions. Our 14% growth this year in both adjusted earnings and free cash flow per share clearly demonstrates value creation at the intersection of the hallmarks of Fiserv : a strong business model, operational discipline and consistent capital allocation. Our second priority was to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. During the quarter, Salem Five Cents Savings Bank, a $4.2 billion institution, selected DNA in a competitive process, along with a full suite of digital solutions from Fiserv, including Corillian, Mobiliti, CheckFree RXP and debit processing. Salem Five has also decided to adopt our newest solution, Messenger Center, for both large commercial and small businesses from Online Banking Solutions, or OBS, which we acquired in December. Messenger Center is an award-winning, sophisticated cash management solution differentiating on a mix of digital experience and leading functionality which fits the size and complexity of the customer. We are pleased to have been selected by Salem Five as a partner on their go-forward vision of next-generation technology and expanding commercial capabilities. We were very pleased to have a more than 20% increase in DNA signings as compared to 2015. And importantly, we implemented 20 new DNA clients during the year, including 7 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. We signed more than 220 clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution in 2016 while growing subscribers over 30% to 5.5 million. While we are pleased with our growth, the current subscriber base still represents less than 15% of the underlying deposit accounts served with our ASP product. Mobiliti business also continued to prosper, more than doubling the number of live clients on the platform this year and nearly 4x the number of end users. We remain very bullish on the size, scale and importance of the digital opportunities. Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. A huge priority in 2016 was to meaningfully enhance our upper-end commercial solutions to better enable clients to serve their most important customers. Early in the year, we bolstered our commercial services portfolio through a partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services with our account processing platforms. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, which meaningfully extends our sophisticated cash management, digital business banking and secure browser capabilities for large commercial and small business clients. Today, OBS serves 13 of the top 100 banks, which is strong evidence of the quality of their suite of services. These cash management and digital banking services are already integrated with several of our account processing solutions, and we are excited about the enhanced value we can deliver to our commercially focused clients. We continue to see very strong client interest in Architect, our integrated online and mobile banking solution that serves both retail and business customers on a single platform. We have more than 150 clients live today and have grown the sales pipeline to 6x the level it was when we acquired the solution nearly a year ago. We handily beat our first year sales expectations, and integration is progressing as expected. Last January, we acquired an innovative billing and payments platform that now serves as the basis of our next-generation solution, dubbed BillMatrix Next. This platform is being extended to include the best of our current biller platform, providing flexible multichannel billing and payment solutions for all-sized businesses, along with enhanced functionality for our large billers and all with much faster implementation times. We are also making these market-leading services available to our account processing clients to help them better serve their customers. As an early proof point, Bank of the Ozarks, a $19 billion asset institution, chose BillMatrix Next in the quarter and was able to go live in less than 30 days, versus a historical process, which could have easily taken 6 months or longer. We are excited about this new opportunity to serve the biller market more broadly and faster than ever before. Towards the end of 2016, we also went live with Notifi, which empowers our clients through a highly customizable alerts engine that allows real-time communication with their customers. So far, over 50 clients have selected this differentiated product and are beginning to go live. Notifi is already integrated into several of our account processing platforms, online banking platforms and Mobiliti. These are just a few examples of the new innovation we are bringing to market to better enable our clients to win in the markets they serve. We expect our new solutions will scale over time and make meaningful contributions to internal revenue growth acceleration over the next several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide additional detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.16. Internal revenue growth of 5% was led by strong performance in our Payments segment. Overall, the revenue growth in the quarter was generally in line with expectations, with the exception of international business, where revenue growth was negatively impacted by slower sales and some deal slippage. These deals were concentrated in license revenue, which created a rather large impact revenue hit for the international business in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 32.1% in the quarter due primarily to an easier prior year compare, as we mentioned during the Q3 earnings call. We marked the 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth by achieving 14% for the full year. Full year operating margin was up 50 basis points to 32.2%, driven by -- primarily by Payments segment performance and a continued focus on operational effectiveness. As Jeff mentioned, this performance is even better when considering the 30 basis points of dilutive margin impact from acquisitions. Our Payments segment continued to produce strong internal revenue growth of 6% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in the quarter was led by card services, output solutions and our risk management businesses. Adjusted revenue, which includes the results from acquired businesses, grew 9% in the quarter to $728 million and 10% for the full year to $2.8 billion. Debit transaction volume growth remained in the high single digits and for the year was accompanied by a 10% increase in new client signings to more than 160 institutions. P2P transactions grew more than 30% for the full year, aided by a meaningful increase in Popmoney Instant transactions, which were up a stellar 375% over the prior year. We further expanded our digital footprint, adding more than 220 Mobiliti clients and more than 350 bill payment clients during the year. Mobiliti ASP users were up 30% to 5.5 million subscribers for the year, and they were up nearly 90% over the last 2 years. And as Jeff mentioned, we're still in the early stages of helping our clients capture the unique opportunities presented by digital transformation. Payments segment adjusted operating income increased 8% in the quarter to $241 million and for the year was up a very strong 13% to $946 million. Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% due primarily to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. For the full year, adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to a new high water mark of 33.8%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth in scale businesses and operational efficiency, which more than offset the 60 basis point negative segment impact from acquisitions. Adjusted Financial segment revenue was $644 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year, which translated to a 2% internal revenue growth in both periods. We saw solid contributions from our lending and account processing businesses in the quarter, offset by the weaker performance, including FX, in our international businesses mentioned earlier. Although the Q4 international results were disappointing, a portion of the operational shortfall is timing-based and should improve the results in 2017. Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $217 million in the quarter and $823 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.7%, up slightly sequentially and our strongest margin performance for the year. As a reminder, we mentioned on our last call that the Q4 2015 operating margin was unusually low, resulting in a comparative benefit primarily from business mix and timing of some of the larger expenses last year. Full year adjusted operating margin for the segment was 33.2%, declining 60 basis points, primarily from the very strong prior year performance comparison, the international shortfall and incremental investments in some of our newer innovation-based solutions, such as Agiliti and Notifi. In the past few years, we've increased investments in the Financial segment, and still, the Financial segment adjusted operating margin has increased 60 basis points over the last 2 years. Corporate and Other results were in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter, up a full point over the prior year, and the full year rate of 34.5% was essentially flat to the prior year. We adopted the new rules on accounting for excess tax benefits for share-based compensation on January 1. As a result, we estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 to be slightly below 33%. And while the actual adjusted tax rate will vary each year on the basis of excess benefits realized, we anticipate our tax rate to remain generally at this level for the foreseeable future. Our strong business model generated a record $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2017 -- excuse me, 2016. Free cash flow per share increased 14% to $4.84, 9% higher than adjusted EPS of $4.43 and $0.14 higher than our minimum free cash flow expectation for the year. We received a $10 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture in the fourth quarter and $150 million for the year, both of which are excluded from our earnings and free cash flow results. Over the life of the investment, StoneRiver has produced more than $1 billion of cash distributions. Total debt outstanding at year-end was $4.6 billion or 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted leverage ratio. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of stock in the quarter for $265 million, and for the year, we repurchased 11.9 million shares, returning $1.2 billion to our shareholders. There were 215.5 million shares outstanding at year-end, and including a $15 million share repurchase authorization announced in the fourth quarter had 20.5 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. Finally, earlier this week, we jointly announced an agreement to sell our small Australian item-processing business to Genpact. This business is part of our international operations included in our Financial segment and represents less than 1/2 of 1% of our annual revenue. Given the end market and the stand-alone nature of this business, we felt another party could be better suited to run this business. The financial impact of this business is de minimis and is incorporated in our 2017 guidance. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales bounced back strongly in 2016, allowing us to print a record sales year. Sales attainment was 108% in the quarter and increased 22% over the prior year. Sales were up 21% for the full year, achieving 103% of quota. Q4 sales were led by our account processing and output solutions businesses and domestically were generally strong across the board. We saw a healthy increase in the number of new large deals signed for the year. And most important, even after a record sales year, our pipeline is very solid entering 2017. Integrated sales were excellent in the quarter, increasing 17% to $105 million and up 14% for the full year to $292 million. We continue to see solid demand in areas such as card services, bill payment, custom statements and digital solutions. We realized operational effectiveness savings of $64 million, meaningfully exceeding our $40 million target for the year. Savings were led primarily by procurement and workforce optimization. We also made very good progress on our data center consolidation, combining 18 locations during the year. Our operational effectiveness target for 2017 is $60 million. There is palpable optimism in the banking market on the heels of the election, with increased conviction in a rising rate environment coupled with regulatory reform. While it's hard to translate this positive sentiment to near-term results, we do believe that it could bias favorably for technology spend over the mid- to long term. For 2017, we expect clients to focus their spend on a broad combination of digital services, risk management and, in particular, cyber, along with the return to investing in more revenue-centric technologies, such as cash management and all forms of lending. Lastly, we remain optimistic about bank focus and commitment on P2P through the Zelle consortium. We are excited to play a leading role in the ultimate system-wide adoption of this important initiative. With that, let's move to 2017. At the start of each year, we provide context to help shareholders assess our overall performance. For 2017, our 3 shareholder priorities are : first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payments solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Financially for 2017, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to expand and be within a range of 4% to 5%, which, as you may recall, includes any anticipated impact of foreign exchange. We expect our internal revenue growth acceleration to come from a combination of sources, such as a positive impact of higher sales, the recovery of the delayed implementations we talked about in Q3, less EMV deferral and stronger organic transaction growth in some of our payments businesses, such as Biller Solutions. Given the natural ramp of new revenue and the number of larger sales transactions we recorded in 2016, we expect Q1 to be the low revenue growth point of the year and that the overall 2017 internal revenue growth rate will be higher in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 14% to 17% or $5.03 to $5.17 for the year and that the growth pacing through the year will generally mirror the revenue growth trend. We also anticipate adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the year. Lastly, we expect 2017 free cash flow per share will be at least $5.45 or minimum growth of 13% per share over last year. We exit 2016 with another year of strong financial results even as revenue was light of our expectations. We delivered our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, expanded operating margin and achieved record free cash flow and sales. Our business model continues to deliver high-quality results, and we expect revenue growth expansion to be back on track for 2017. We thank our more than 23,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly with passion and commitment to deliver differentiated value for clients and shareholders alike. Finally, we've named Paul Seamon to lead our Investor Relations team as of February 28. Paul has been at Fiserv for 10 years in a variety of financial-oriented positions and is well suited for this new role. I want to thank Stephanie Gregor for her dedication in IR over the last 3 years and wish her the very best as she leaves our financial planning and analysis organization. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : Yes, and I guess, first of all, you mentioned the sale to Genpact. I was just wondering about the acquisition in January. Any metrics around rough size of revenue and if there's some margin pressure expected from that acquisition in 2017? Robert Hau : Yes. Dave, it's Bob. Overall, we're excited about the product and the solution that, that brings to us. But from an impact to both revenue and EPS, it's a relatively small acquisition and so you won't see a real impact. And of course, it is fully anticipated in our guidance for 2017. Jeffery Yabuki : And Dave, it's really a -- substantially a product acquisition. They have a nice footprint of clients, and we expect that to be both sold -- continue to be sold directly but also -- and the most important element of it in our current value proposition is to integrate it into other platforms to make our commercial services proposition substantially more robust. David Koning : Got you. Okay. And then your business is so steady and like every quarter is good, basically. So maybe if I just think long term about margins, they keep going up. Is that mostly a function of where the most growth is coming from, is just the highest incremental margin, and maybe some of the lower growth products that you have might just be lower margin? Is that the main thing? Or is it just that you're cutting cost in certain areas and allowing margins to go up that way? And maybe how sustainable is this over time, because it's been so good? Jeffery Yabuki : So that's a great question, Dave. And we'll probably tag team this a bit. It is -- we have the very good fortune of having a business which has any number of scaled businesses, whether it be an account processing platform like Premier or a debit processing business or bill pay. We've got a number of towers of businesses where we've put lots and lots money into the infrastructure, and as we invest, we can move those investments over large blocks of clients and large numbers of transactions. And because they're large processing engines, they tend to have higher incremental margins on the way in. So that's number one. Number two, as you know, we have -- we've had -- we're in our third phase now of operational effectiveness, and we've done a pretty good job. We got -- I think we got around $64 million in 2016 in terms of taking costs out of our infrastructure. Some of that drops through to the bottom line, but a lot of that goes back into product and allows us to invest into product in a more substitution way or pattern instead of it just being incremental. So we've got that as well. And then the other thing is, several years ago, you may remember we were investing in some technologies like mobile, where we were having to invest in front of the curve. Because we tend to buy these -- I'm sorry, we tend to build these larger technology stacks and infrastructures, we have to build them before the revenue comes on. That compresses our margin. When the revenue starts to come on, we make it up here. It's one of the reasons why, in Bob's prepared remarks, he mentioned that we are now starting to put more money into the Financial segment. And so we would expect to see Financial segment, which has really grown rapidly over the last several years, maybe start to moderate a bit because we're putting these big investments in -- or putting the investments in there. Some of them are larger. And then, over time, that will scale back up. But we've said for a long time that we believe that we have a lot of room to continue to grow margin over time, even in the face of competitive pressure, because of the proactivity we have, frankly, in managing our cost base and some of the towers of scale technologies. Mark Ernst : The only thing I'd add to that is things like data center consolidation, this is something Jeff commented on in the -- or Bob maybe did in the prepared remarks, but we are really in year 2 of a 5-year process. There's -- a lot of opportunity remains in something like that. There are any number of these things where we know we can become much more efficient, and it actually enhances the delivery that we have for our clients because of the efficiency that we're able to put into our operations. So I would agree; we've got a lot of room to run yet. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, I'm just wondering if you can comment a little bit in the U.S., I think -- I'm thinking particularly about the credit union market, but generally on the competitive environment and whether you've seen a change there. You've obviously done very well with DNA. So maybe you can discuss takeaways and maybe in pricing perhaps on some of those wins. I'm just trying to get a general sense of what you're seeing out there. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. And when you say credit union, Andrew, I assume you mean the core account processing piece of the credit union? Andrew Jeffrey : Yes, exactly, right. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say that, across credit union and bank and frankly everywhere, the market is competitive and it continues to be competitive. And as we've talked about on several different occasions, there's a dynamic in the market where there are more competitors chasing less financial institutions. And that's a pretty good formula for intensity. And so we continue to see that. It is one of the reasons why we have been investing the way we have in some products, such as Architect, as we mentioned earlier. And in fact, even financial messenger by OBS will also -- or Messenger Center by OBS will also allow some of the larger credit unions to provide commercial services to their clients. So I think that's -- we are looking to build a broader formula for differentiation around our account processing core value proposition. Frankly, we think that DNA is the strongest -- what's the right way to say it -- is the strongest account processing engine facing off to the credit union market today because of the modern elements of the platform and the workflows, et cetera, et cetera. And frankly, we're going head-to-head with competitors that I'm sure you can imagine on a regular basis. As far as takeaways, we typically don't give those numbers, but we're winning over our fair share of the beauty pageants that we're invited to participate in. So we feel good about where we're going in that space. Andrew Jeffrey : And don't let anybody ever say you're not good looking, right? Would you characterize the environment competitively as -- I know you said consistently it's competitive. Has it gotten more so in your view in the last 12 months? Jeffery Yabuki : So again, one of the problems is, because all of us, all of the core competitors have both core and other products, it depends on what you're talking about. If we're talking about digital, everything digital is very competitive in terms of you've got some competitors that you know about, you've got 7 kids in a garage building new technologies, and it's pretty easy to put stuff out there. So those -- the fringes of the core processing platforms, or the value, some of the value -- interesting value elements of the core processing platforms are more competitive. And even in the credit union space, there are companies such as Corelation that weren't in the mix a couple of years ago. You've got some folks coming in from outside. So I would say that the processes are more competitive. I frankly don't see -- I don't see a lot of different movement in the market as we sit here today, but it is incumbent upon companies like us -- and I can only speak to us strategically -- that we're building value propositions that will allow us to continue to prosper over the mid to long term. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, that's helpful. And one quick one, Bob. Could you perhaps quantify the benefits in your EPS guidance from the excess tax benefits from SBC? Robert Hau : Yes, I think the way to think about it is the slightly less than 33% tax rate is, call it 1.5 points below what we've seen over the last couple of years. So 34.5% in '16, 34.5% in 2015. That equates to an order of magnitude about $0.13, $0.14 benefit in 2017. And again, as we mentioned in the opening comments, that is something that we expect to see for the foreseeable future. So this is a step down and then holds for that -- for a period of time. Andrew Jeffrey : That's the non-GAAP tax rate, okay. Robert Hau : That is the -- it's an adjusted tax rate, that's correct, but this change in accounting is GAAP driven. Operator : Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Rayna Kumar : This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. For 2017, could you please quantify expected organic revenue growth and margin expansion between Payments and Financial segments and maybe just call out the drivers? Robert Hau : Yes. From the standpoint of 2016, we actually don't break that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Jeffery Yabuki : 2017. Robert Hau : 2017, we don't break that out between the 2 segments. In our 4% to 5% guidance for the internal rate of growth, you can certainly expect, like we've seen for the last several years, our Payments segment will grow faster than our Financial segment. But we don't give specific guidance between the 2 segments. Rayna Kumar : Got it. What percent of your customers have completed the EMV card reissuance? And maybe if you can just tell us what that breakdown is between credit and debit. Jeffery Yabuki : So you'll remember that we're substantially a debit provider, and most people know that debit was kind of in the back seat relative to credit issuance because of the differentials and potential fraud risk. We would say we're kind of in the middle innings of the reissue, and we expect to see -- continue to see benefits this year or next year. We also mentioned earlier in the year that we had our first major institution go to contactless, and we expect that, that will also start to create a little bit of momentum in the market going towards the end of '17 but certainly into '18 and '19. Rayna Kumar : Okay. And one last one from me. If you can just call out term fees in the fourth quarter and how that compares to last year and your expectations for '17. Robert Hau : So for term fees in the fourth quarter, as expected, we did see some growth year-over-year for the quarter. But on a full year basis, as we described in our Q3 earnings call, we did see term fees down year-over-year. Overall license and term in aggregate was up, call it about $10 million on a full-year basis. For 2017, again, we don't give that specific guidance but certainly incorporate it in our overall internal rate of growth of 4% to 5%. Operator : Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Pu Chen : This is Christen Chen in for Ramsey. I guess maybe piggyback off of Dave's question. Just on the '17 guide, aside from operating leverage and the operational cost initiatives, are there any other items to call out in terms of impacting -- impacts on margins? I mean, potentially the acquisitions you all made in '16 that was dilutive could make some contributions. Are there any other items that we should be thinking about? And then also, does your guidance assume any share buybacks? Jeffery Yabuki : So on the margin question specifically, our guidance for the year is at least 50 basis points. We would expect that as we grow the acquisitions that we brought into the family that they would probably have some barely de minimis impact on margin this year. Because you have to sell and then it has to convert to revenue, there could be something small. But the majority -- the substantial, substantial majority of the margin is coming from a combination of revenue growth against scaled solutions and our efforts against operational effectiveness. Mark Ernst : Share repurchase. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, all of the uses of capital that we contemplate during the year would be included in our guidance. Pu Chen : Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit. We've seen some of the PIN debit networks get more aggressive in terms of rolling out PINless debit and kind of authentication solutions that are relevant to signature. How far along are you all with that kind of process in terms of being able to handle signature transactions? And how do you guys see that debit market evolving now that Visa's backed off of some of their EMV-related routing strategies? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, that's a really good question. We have been working on this technology for a couple of years in preparation for a day when the market could be more open. And so we're, let's say, well prepared to take advantage of those opportunities where they exist, and we're excited about how the market is moving. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I guess -- apologies if this was already answered, but can you maybe talk about the outlook you see for bank consolidation this year and whether that's any kind of factor in terms of your outlook for this year and then kind of maybe the impact further on out? Jeffery Yabuki : So we don't anticipate bank consolidation to be any -- in any way meaningfully different than we saw in '16. Although there is certainly significantly more optimism at this stage of the year than there was last year, the banking business is still tough. And there will continue to be winners and losers in the acquisition and merger wars, and we will continue to win and take, hopefully, our fair share of those. So we haven't accounted for it specifically. We don't sit here and say that there is going to be a significant change in both termination fees or anything else. And specifically with regard to '17, because of the timing on deconversions, typically we have a good idea already of what that's going to look like, and so we would have factored a lot of that into our numbers already. James Schneider : That's helpful color. And then I'm not sure if I missed it or you mentioned it, but can you maybe talk about the DNA wins that you kind of achieved in 2016 and whether you expect 2017 to be better or worse than that? Jeffery Yabuki : So wins in 2016 were roughly 20%, a little bit more than 20% greater than they were in '15 in terms of number of institutions. 20 institutions went live. Of those institutions that went live, 7 of them had assets greater than $1 billion. We did sign our largest DNA client ever in 2017 -- in 2016, I'm sorry, in terms of size, asset size. So we're quite excited about that installation. It actually opens up a new segment of the market that we're focused on right now. Momentum in DNA is very strong. And the combination of DNA coupled with the steps that we've taken to enhance our commercial services capabilities we think is a winning combination. So we expect to have pretty good pipeline building during the year and hopefully a few more wins. But over time, we expect that to be a very powerful combination, the pairing up of real-time, straight-through-processing commercial capabilities that already links up to our what we would say is best in the market retail proposition. Operator : Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I guess my first question is with regards to CapEx, and what are the top 2 key areas of investment that you're doing? I am specifically asking this question because, Jeff, you highlighted innovation. So that's where I want to go with... Robert Hau : Yes, I would say, Ashwin, that probably the largest, by a good amount right now, is the data center work that we've got going on, both in terms of the consolidation as well as improving the overall efficiency of those data centers and actually preparing to lower cost in the short term as well as gain scale in the long term as we consolidate that. Those operations, we build in best-in-class capability as well as scalability. So we see some long-term benefits of that investment. That would definitely be the highest one we've got right now for '16 and '17 for that matter. Jeffery Yabuki : And Ashwin, we are making a lot of different investments in innovation. Make no mistake about that. But for better or worse, almost all of the investments that we make in innovation tend to be around people, and we have a pretty conservative posture that we take on cap software. And therefore, it's running through the P&L. So that's one of the things -- one of the reasons why we highlighted the margin, the change in shift from the Payments segment to starting to move some incremental investments over to financial because they -- we don't capitalize the majority of them and they run through the P&L. That's where they're going to be seen. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. And then going back to the topic of competition, and I appreciate the answer you gave a short while ago, but when core deals come up for renewal nowadays, do you still expect the percent won by incumbents would stay relatively consistent? I mean, there are, at least the way I look at it, really the top 2, 3 players tend to win most of the stuff that comes up, and that's how it's been. And is that going to change? Is that -- I'm kind of wondering why you brought up the topic of competition, heightened competition. And FIS had done the same so... Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I only brought it up because someone asked a question. Ash, what I would say, again, it depends on the market. If you were talking about mobile banking, there could easily be 30 or 40 competitors for mobile banking, where frankly, 6 years ago, there was -- there were probably the account processors, the core processors and Digital Insight. And now it's a much broader space, and that has spread to the -- some of the payments capabilities and everything else that gets dragged along. There are -- there is new -- there's more competition on the credit union side of the house, certainly around core processing. And we have some non-U.S. competitors in the larger end of the market that we were not seeing before who are in the market trying to take share. Conversely, what I would say is, at least our data would say that less clients are switching nowadays. And so the incumbents do have a -- they do have a strong position in that people are saying, \"I'd rather not switch my core because there's all these other things that I need to do,\" whether it's put in a new commercial cash management system or a new mobile experience, or whatever the case may be, that's tending to take more priority than swapping core. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. My last question is with regards to -- in your prepared remarks you talked about how banks are at least beginning to look at some, let's call it -- I think the term you used was revenue-centric demand, which is a great term. I guess the question there becomes, as your clients invest in this demand, is it more advantageous to potentially sort of lead with some sort of consulting or people-based capability? Do they look for that kind of thing? Being focused more on revenue growth, does it give you any kind of benefit on pricing? Could you answer those sorts of questions perhaps? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I'll give you my perspective, and others may want to add as well. It really depends a little bit on the size of the institution and what's their DNA. There are some larger institutions that do everything through -- or do make a lot of their bigger decisions using people-based consulting services to help them get to a place where they can make a technology decision. And sometimes those consultants will have an impact or bearing on the actual technology that's ultimately selected. But for the majority, the substantial majority of the market, these decisions are not made via kind of the people-based services that you're talking about. Sometimes there are independent third parties who are helping the institutions to intermediate the buying decisions. They're running processes, buying processes and things like that. But for the most part, on the kinds of products that we're talking about here, whether they be new commercial cash management or commercial lending or some of the consumer lending types of products, the solutions that are going to drive real tangible revenue, could also be digital account opening, those types of capabilities, we're not seeing a lot of intermediation there. Mark, I don't... Mark Ernst : I think that's exactly right. We just don't see that going on very much in the market. I mean, certainly there's anecdotal situations where that occurs, but it's more -- far more the exception when we see it than it is any kind of a trend. And as a result, we don't feel compelled to help solve that problem. Operator : Our next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, you talked about, at the beginning of the call, banks feeling better, obviously interest rates improving and also them hoping for regulatory relief. Has that yet resulted in better spending? Or is it that the banks just are anticipating this and when it happens you'll see the spending? Jeffery Yabuki : It would be more the latter than the former. It is right now manifesting in conversations. So for example, I've had a couple of conversations this year with CEOs that I haven't had in a while, and the conversation went something like this : \"So why don't you tell me what you have that can help us build our business?\" That's a different conversation than, \"Why don't you tell us what you can do to help us save some money on our technology spend?\" And that -- I'm using that only as an example to say that is the feeling in the market right now. But as we said in the remarks as well, I see this to be much more of a mid- to long-term benefit because, first of all, some things are going to have to happen. Opinions are changing, but something's going to have to happen to have people say, \"All right, I'm going to be able to lock in some benefit, and now I can do something different with it.\" Mark Ernst : At this point, this is a 60-day phenomenon. I mean -- and we think it's going to continue because of where rates are going and because the prospect of regulatory kind of easing, but there's a long way between there and spending. Jeffery Yabuki : And I would say that right now, as we sit here today, our guidance clearly does not contemplate any kind of meaningful change in buying behaviors in the market. Kartik Mehta : And Jeff, if you look at the momentum behind the organic growth improvement for you in 2017 compared to 2017 -- 2016, is that the result of innovation? Is it the result of that the banks needed to spend on things that you're offering? And just to take it one step further, what would change that momentum into 2018? Jeffery Yabuki : So the big drivers going from '16 to '17, probably the first -- the most important item is sales. We had a pretty weak '15, we had a weak Q1, and we had a very strong Q2, 3 and 4. And we have a fairly strong pipeline entering 2017. And so a 20% increase in sales, which obviously will have to get implemented over time, much of those sales get implemented over time, we feel like that is something that is on the shelf and now it's a matter of us getting implemented and having -- making sure the clients and the way we partner with clients gets that done. And we talked about that in Q3, how that actually had a little bit of a negative effect on us because we got delayed. But that's point one. Point two is we have some products that we talked about today, Notifi being one of them, but Notifi and instant issue, CardValet, IPS, some products that we expected would have bigger benefits in '16. And we're seeing some continuing aggregate demand there. And we expect that, that will now start to come online and help us, for better or worse, coming off a lower compare in '16 than we had originally anticipated. We also, as we mentioned, are having some good traction in products like BillMatrix Next and Architect, which were previously not treated as organic revenue growing products because they were in the first year of acquisition, and so we'll get some tailwind from that. A little bit more EMV. Mobiliti will continue to grow. And then probably the last thing I would say is Zelle, right. Zelle is predicted to go live in June. And if it goes live, we'll get some benefit. But the beauty there is it has everyone looking at their retail payment strategies and how they fit. And our -- some of our technologies, like our IPS experience, which is a single-landing idea for account-to-account transfers, bill pay and P2P, we expect things like -- technologies like that to have an impact. We talked about Popmoney Instant transactions I think being up nearly 400% for the year. I think those are the areas that give us some comfort going into '17. And frankly, the thing that could derail us is if something happens in the market where clients freeze up and they're not implementing or they're not moving forward. That is where I see the big risk in our numbers this year. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Christopher Shutler : So I guess first, just wondering what happened in the quarter in international, maybe just a little bit more detail there. I'm assuming it was around Agiliti, but maybe just quantify what happened in terms of the shortfall over -- how much was timing versus something else? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it wasn't Agiliti at all. In fact, Agiliti, we had a couple of go-lives in Q4 which actually went pretty well. And Agiliti is longer-tailed revenue. So an issue with Agiliti we would have known. It was all really license-oriented revenue, so high amounts of sales converting to impact revenue. The majority of those got pushed into '17, and so we'll look for that lay-in, in '17, all things being equal. Christopher Shutler : Okay, great. And then on DNA, would you mind just running through those numbers with us again? And I'm curious how many of the DNA signings and implementations have been new clients versus existing ones? Jeffery Yabuki : So sales in 2017 were up 22%. Institutions in 2016, sorry, were up 22 -- 20% versus 2015. And implementations were at 20, and 7 of those implementations were -- 7 of those implementations were assets -- institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. On the credit union side it is -- you have a little bit more migration of existing platforms to new, but definitely we have new. And on the bank side, it's almost all new. Christopher Shutler : Okay, got you. And then lastly, Jeff, when you talk about sales, sales were up, I think, 22% in the quarter, so strong number. Is that sales number measuring TCV sold in the quarter? Or is that kind of an annualized revenue from sales? I'm just trying to understand that. Jeffery Yabuki : It's TCV. Christopher Shutler : Okay. Could you give us some sense of the annualized revenue growth? I just -- I ask because I know that in the market there have been a lot more sales that have been kind of longer, longer and longer time frames. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, we don't provide that information. I will say that the -- what's -- the best way to think about it is the implementation cycles for the things that were sold, there were a couple of items we mentioned -- a couple of big sales we mentioned in Q2 that we thought were going to have shorter cycles, and lo and behold, they're going to end up being 12- to 18-month cycles. So I would say, for the most part, the tracking of the implementation cycles is about on par with where it has been historically. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Michael Reid : This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I was wondering if you could give us maybe some color on some of the new initiatives : CheckFree, DNA, Mobiliti, Popmoney and even some of the newer ones. Does one of those, you think, have opportunity to move the needle this year maybe more than some of the others? Jeffery Yabuki : We're all sitting here thinking. We're contemplating the question. I think in the aggregate they'll move the needle. The ability for any one of -- I mean, the beauty of our model is it's a recurring revenue model and it builds in transactions over time. The difficulty in our model is it's a recurring revenue model which builds in transactions over time. And so from our perspective, we care a lot more about how well are we doing it at building the products and putting them into the market and having them drive value so they're going to be adopted and drive revenue. So yes, in the aggregate, they're going to move the needle a bit in '17, but when you think about '18 and '19, that's where it's going to matter. And I would use Mobiliti as an example. I think Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks that Mobiliti users have grown 90% over the last 2 years and that -- to 5.5 million. To the extent that some of these products have the ability to do that -- and they do. In fact, products like Notifi are much broader-based than something like Mobiliti. They can have meaningful impacts on the company for a long period of time in terms of driving growth. But more importantly, they create differentiated advantages for our clients, for us and therefore our clients, and that's why these solutions are so important. Mark Ernst : But the net effect of that is almost nothing can kind of pop in a given year and move the needle. Jeffery Yabuki : In those kinds of products. Mark Ernst : In those kind of solutions. Michael Reid : Okay, individually. Mark Ernst : Yes. Michael Reid : Okay. And then keeping it on to 2018, then, do you think that could be an acceleration year if the momentum continues? And then what would be an early indication of that taking hold? Jeffery Yabuki : So the answer to the first part of the question was yes, and the answer to the second part of the question is I think that's a better discussion at Investor Day. Operator : Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Good to catch up. I jumped in a little bit late, but just, I guess, Jeff, following up on your comment around the potential for freezing of client spending, that makes sense, which sort of reminded me to ask, is compliance revenue -- how big of a contribution has that been in terms of new sales in the last couple of years? And how big is it in terms of revenue now? I'm curious if that's an area where you could see some delays or deferrals. Jeffery Yabuki : So while compliance was at the top of everyone's list, I was frustrated that we weren't moving fast enough to put products into the market against that demand. So now when we think maybe compliance products will be a little bit more out of vogue, I'm not too concerned about the impact on our revenue. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay, good. I figured so much. And then just on the -- just overall big picture, just thinking about visibility, I know you've gotten a lot of questions around it, but just thinking about visibility in this environment today versus 12 months ago, how would you characterize that? Jeffery Yabuki : Revenue visibility? Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, I'm sorry, revenue visibility, earnings visibly, however you want to handle that. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, pretty -- I mean, pretty high. We are blessed with, again, a business model that, as you know, has a pretty high degree of recurring revenue. And for the most part we can see what's coming. The beauty of any number of the products and services that we've been building is we're selling them fairly early. They're getting queued. The biggest issue that I -- that we will have is if clients make decisions that delays implementations, especially large ones. Yes, that's -- and to the extent that some of these products are dependent upon consumer adoption, obviously you've got an issue because of the intermediary role that the institutions play. But on balance, I think we're in reasonable shape. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Condra of Credit Suisse. Paul Condra : Just a couple quick ones, I guess. You didn't size that impact on the international kind of timing issue in the Financial segment? Robert Hau : No. Paul Condra : Okay. And then the -- you mentioned dilution from the acquisition. Could you quantify that, on the margin impact? I'm just kind of curious how much you outgrew that. Robert Hau : Yes. So we talked about it in terms of the full year impact in 2016. Had we not had that dilution, the margins for the overall company would have been up by about 30 basis points. For our Payments segment alone it's about 60 points. Paul Condra : Okay. Okay, great. And should we think of that 50 bps as kind of continuing into 2018, the way to think about continued margin expansion? Robert Hau : Yes. Jeffery Yabuki : And we -- what we have said, Paul, is that we believe as part of our long-term guidance that we have the ability to increase our adjusted operating margin by generally at least 50 basis points per year on average. Paul Condra : Perfect. Okay, great. And then one just kind of broader question. I mean, a lot of focus on H-1B visas. And I'm curious if you have any kind of -- like your mix of employees that work with those visas and how you're thinking about changes to that program and any impact you might have. Jeffery Yabuki : I think at this stage we're paying attention to what's going on and we'll likely see how it all settles out. Operator : Our last question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Can you talk a little bit about the commercial cash management or treasury management, however we want to talk about it? All of a sudden it seems like there's a lot of focus on that. Jack Henry is starting to build their own. You guys bought a nice asset. What's the driver for that? Is it just sort of time? Or is it that banks are refocusing on that? Or have we just underinvested in it? Kind of what's changing in the market that's driving that, do you think? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So Brett, I would say that it's a combination of factors. If you look at surveys right now of bank executives who are making technology decisions or maybe business technologies that are enabled by technology, near the top of the list you're going to see commercial cash management and commercial lending. And so those capabilities, because they are serving the most important clients in the bank, have always been important, but they're becoming more important. And they're becoming more important because the retail profitability of the banks is getting compressed, and therefore banks are going to the places that they know and that's serving their commercial clients. And the further up you want to move in the size of the institution -- so as you break through $1 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion or $10 billion, the commercial capability is the most important part of the -- often the most important part of the analysis, the buyer analysis. And so that's why I believe you're hearing people talk about it. For us, we made a decision that said -- we have been looking at building, and we have built our product meaningfully over the last 3 or 4 years, but our decision was it was time to leapfrog the market. And we -- the solution that we bought is a solution that the guys who did the business had been -- actually was the original Magnet guy, Dan Myers, and he -- this has been his life. And he -- they know how to build cash management. It has gotten fantastic reviews. We heard it, we kept hearing about it from clients, and it was a little bit of if you can't beat them, join them. And instead of having to wait 3, 4, 5 years to build something and get into the market -- because you really -- this is an area where you need to have deep, deep, deep functional expertise, and we thought this was by far the most prudent way to go. And we are thrilled with the responses that we've gotten from our clients and prospects as it relates to this acquisition. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then just last one on P2P. I know it's been discussed a little bit. Any updates on your view on the game between bank-driven versus nonbank-driven peer-to-peer? With PayPal starting to work more together with banks I think the distinction maybe got a little bit murkier. Any additional data or any additional thoughts you have on this peer-to-peer as it evolves, number one? And then number two, monetization of peer-to-peer other than express payments, or is this more of a relationship we want to make sure our customers stay within our digital footprint? Jeffery Yabuki : So Brett, I would say -- and Mark may want to add on to this. I would say that it's been our belief that if you give a consumer a choice, would you rather move your money through a regulated financial institution or a company that is a merchant acquirer, they probably won't know what a merchant acquirer is and they'll likely go with the regulated financial institution. Now I'm -- it's a little tongue-in-cheek because Venmo has done well, and those folks have done a nice job with it, no question about that. The -- we're very aligned with what's going on with Zelle, and we are optimistic that, through Zelle and Popmoney and any number of others, that banks will end up being the primary place in which payments move from one person to another. Our revenue model is based on transactions. And so while there may be no consumer-based transaction, as is the case in many other examples, we are providing a very safe and very secure product that allows that money to move with complete confidence to the consumer. And we've invested lots of money to make sure that we have the leading product in the market. And we do, and we're excited about that. So we do see monetization there on top of the real-time instant opportunity that we talked about. Mark Ernst : Yes, the only thing I'd add is we do a lot of research, and we are tracking the market and consumer attitudes around this whole space pretty regularly. We have not seen any change in the fact that consumers, by a large margin, prefer their financial institution, their existing bank or credit union, to be the provider of this service, and they are looking for a common network or a common brand through which to do that. And so we -- that's why we are so excited about the prospect of the Zelle capability coming online. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Brett. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to give us a call. We also look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day later on in the year. Have a good night, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance comparisons made throughout this call are year-to-year metrics. As a reminder, we're holding our Investor Day on June 20 in New York City. We expect the session to begin at 9 :30 a.m. and end around noon. We'll have a number of our executives available to meet with attendees before and after the event. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a strong start to the year with financial results for the quarter slightly ahead of our internal expectations and sales results well ahead of the prior year. Importantly, we're on track to achieve our 2017 financial outlook. Internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and adjusted operating income was up 8%. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18%. Free cash flow per share was stellar, increasing 27%. And that excludes a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture received during the quarter. We were honored to be named one of the FORTUNE magazine's World's Most Admired Companies for a fourth consecutive year, a recognition that we share with our clients, associates and shareholders. We were especially proud to be ranked #1 for innovation in our category for the second year in a row. At the beginning of the year, we shared our 2017 key priorities to help you gauge our progress : the first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter, with strong performance in businesses such as card services, lending solutions and output solutions. Growth in scaled businesses, along with continued progress with our operational effectiveness programs, combined to deliver 60 basis points of operating margin expansion and 8% growth in adjusted operating income. You may have seen that we attained a new level of Payments segment margin that we believe is representative of the strength of those businesses moving forward. At the same time, we continue to operate to deliver the right balance between investment, consistent margin expansion and strong free cash flow. As I said, we're pleased with our results in the quarter and are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments for the full year. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We welcomed Whatcom Educational Credit Union to the Fiserv family in the quarter. This institution, with assets of $1.4 billion, was in the market to upgrade both their core account processing and digital channels technologies in response to the evolving market landscape. In a competitive process, they selected our DNA platform due to its flexibility and modern technology. They also chose Architect, our market-leading digital solution, along with a number of other integrated surrounds, all geared at enabling an exceptional member experience. We signed a total of 5 DNA clients in the quarter, including 4 with assets greater than $1 billion. During the quarter, we also passed the century mark in DNA signings since our acquisition of Open Solutions in 2013. Interest remains high as the market continues to embrace this modern technology platform combined with the power of Fiserv's surround solutions. We expect to see even more over the next several years as we further advance the solution through differentiated product enhancements and integration with our recently acquired market-leading commercial capabilities. You may recall that we mentioned our Notifi alerting solution in Q4. Notifi enables financial institutions to interact with their customers in a personalized way based on transactional data. We signed over 50 institutions in 2016 to our 1.0 solution and added 20 more in the first quarter. We're excited about this capability and optimistic about the value-add data opportunities that should become available over time. Digital experience continues to rise in importance for both financial institutions and the customers they serve. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP continues to grow, increasing nearly 30% over the prior year's quarter and 6% sequentially to 5.8 million subscribers. Our Mobiliti business solution is also taking hold with sales increasing more than 60% over the prior year. Institutions remain in the early stages of unlocking the power of digital and are looking for additional ways to enable value for their retail and commercial customers. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we told you about our recent acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, or OBS, and its sophisticated digital commercial banking product now called Commercial Center. OBS is an example of acquired innovation, which, when coupled with our other leading solutions, positions us to deliver accelerated client value and additional revenue growth. We're encouraged by the interest that OBS has sparked, especially in larger, commercially focused institutions. We mentioned Architect, our integrated online and mobile banking solution for both retail and business customers earlier as part of the Whatcom Educational Credit Union win. Architect was acquired about a year ago and we signed 14 clients to date. We also have a growing pipeline of 70 institutions who are exploring this innovative digital solution. We continue to rank digital experience as one of the most critical areas of focus for all financial institutions, domestically and around the world. Last quarter, we shared our enthusiasm with you for BillMatrix Next, our biller-based digital payments platform, which allows us to efficiently process any number of payment types. This solution has rapidly opened up the broader bill payment market on both a standalone basis and across our account processing clients, enabling enhanced multichannel billing and payment capabilities. We're in the early days of our launch plans and even still had 12 new sales in the first quarter, along with a very strong pipeline. We'll share much more about these growth plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day. Fiserv's PEP+ solution, our integrated payment platform, which provides the ACH infrastructure for many of the largest banks in the U.S., recently won an Innovator Award from PYMNTS.com. The award, which recognized our same-day settlement capability, reflects the growing importance of faster payments in this country. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion, and internal revenue growth was 4%. Solid execution, along with some revenue timing benefits, drove internal revenue growth that was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year as revenue related to 2016 sales and contributions from new initiatives come online. Operating performance was strong, resulting in an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $429 million and also 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 32.5%. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 18% to $1.25, which includes the positive impact of the new accounting treatment for reporting the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation awards. This impact was somewhat offset by low adjusted tax rate in last year's comparable quarter. Our Payments segment delivered 5% internal revenue growth, led by strong growth in card services, output solutions and investment services. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $720 million. Debit transaction growth for the quarter was in the high single digits, and P2P transactions for the period grew more than 20% year-over-year. P2P growth was driven in large part by real-time transactions, which were up significantly at more than 300% in the quarter. We expect further acceleration in our P2P growth throughout 2017 and 2018 as Zelle is launched later this year. The Payments segment adjusted operating income was up 16% to $260 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 270 basis points to 36.2% due to increases in high-quality revenue, benefits from our operational effectiveness programs and to a lesser degree, timing of comparable expenses. While we don't expect margins to increase at that level each quarter, we do expect strong performance in the segment for the balance of the year and into the future. The Financial segment adjusted revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $620 million. Internal revenue growth was up 4%, led by our lending solutions, account processing and international businesses. Revenue growth in the Financial segment was slightly ahead of our expectations due to the acceleration of some periodic revenue we had originally anticipated in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was just ahead of the prior year at $196 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 100 basis points to 31.6%, due primarily to higher sales commissions, the timing of periodic expenses and continued investments in newer products such as Agiliti and Notifi. The corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was up due primarily to a tough prior year comparison. We expect the corporate segment to remain generally consistent with the first quarter's level for the balance of the year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our internal expectations at 29.4%. As discussed in our last call, we included the positive impact from adopting the new accounting standard for the excess benefit of share-based compensation on our adjusted tax rate guidance for the year. The expected benefit is frontloaded in the year due to the timing of option exercises and vesting of restricted units, which can tend to be more concentrated in the first quarter when equity grants typically vest. This benefit was partially offset by a relatively low adjusted tax rate in last year's quarter, producing a net benefit of about $0.06 per share. Consistent with our prior guidance, we continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of slightly below 33%, which translates to a tax rate for the remainder of the year of about 34%. Free cash flow was up a very strong 23% in the quarter to $366 million and up 27% on a per share basis to $1.67, due primarily to strong operating results and positive working capital. These excellent results do not include a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion or 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares for $389 million in the quarter, which is an increase of more than 20% over last year's comparable quarter and equates to 106% of free cash flow. As of March 31, there were 212.9 million shares outstanding and 17 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. We followed up last year's record fourth quarter sales with a solid start to the year. Overall sales in the quarter were up 30% over the prior year and up 35% domestically, led by strong Financial segment sales. Quota attainment came in at 82%, which, as you can tell by the relative performance, reflects increased sales expectations for the full year. Importantly, our domestic pipeline expanded by 17% in the quarter, and we're very well positioned to meet our sales goals for the year. Integrated sales increased 7% to $51 million in the quarter, led by card services, digital solutions and output solution. Providing additional value to our existing client base is an essential part of our strategy. We kicked off the second year of our $250 million 5-year operational effectiveness program in the quarter and achieved $20 million of savings, led primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We also continued to make great progress on our data center consolidation program, combining 5 locations in the quarter. We're well on track to achieve our $60 million objective for the year. The market continues to exude optimism, buoyed by the March Fed interest rate hike, a general sense that we will see some form of relief on the regulatory front and a growing confidence that tax reform of some kind will become a reality this year. These factors, combined with the prospect of additional interest rate hikes over the next 6 to 12 months, is leading to a longer tail of positive sentiment than we've seen in a long time. Although the jury is out on how that may translate to incremental technology spend over time, we are having more conversations about technology focused on digital, commercial services, cyber security and revenue generation, which aligns well with our sources of solution differentiation. Lastly, we continue to be excited about the prospects of bank-based P2P and remain quite active partnering with our clients and EWS to bring Zelle to life later this year. As I said upfront, we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year and continue to expect internal revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we did give color that the first quarter was likely to be the low point for internal revenue growth for the year. For modeling purposes, given our strong start, we don't expect our Q2 internal revenue growth rate to be higher than that of Q1. As shared previously, we fully expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We continue to anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 14% to 17%, or $5.03 to $5.17 for the year. And adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.45 for the full year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We're making progress against our strategic priorities, setting ourselves up to achieve our financial outlook for the year and building momentum towards further growth acceleration in 2018. Investing in tomorrow while delivering results for today is not easy. Thankfully, we have more than 23,000 talented associates who focus their collective energy on creating superior value for clients and shareholders each and every day. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. David Togut : The 30% increase in sales, Jeff, you called out 60% growth in Mobiliti as a driver. Are there any other big drivers behind that? And to what extent you think this elevated level of sales growth is sustainable for the balance of the year? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, that's great. The 60% increase in Mobiliti business sales for the year is a driver of it, but it's not a significant driver. The biggest drivers of sales for the year -- we had a very good quarter in our credit union business. We're making great strides on the digital front, digital including Architect, as I talked about earlier. We had good growth in our biller businesses. We had actually pretty good growth across the board. There were a couple of areas that had a little bit of a slow start because they had -- we had such a strong -- you'll remember, such a strong fourth quarter, and we actually had a pretty darn good third quarter as well. So -- but the pipelines have been growing. Whether or not we can sustain 30% year-over-year-- you'll remember that last year, the first quarter was fairly soft for us. But we do believe we'll have higher sales again this year. And most important, that even the pipeline with higher sales will actually be up going into 2018. So lots of good momentum in the market. David Togut : How should we think about the time to convert these new sales into revenue? Jeffery Yabuki : Normal -- I would say it's our normal cycles. I mean, you're talking about anywhere between 6 months on the low end but really in the -- call it, in the 9 to 12, 9 to 15-month range. David Togut : Got it. And then the big margin expansion in Payments to 32.6%, can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expansion in a little bit more depth? And then to what extent is the 32% to 33% level kind of the new high-water mark? Robert Hau : Yes, David, it's Bob. Overall, obviously, we're pleased with the performance of the business for the quarter. There are a number of things. We talked to a few -- about them in the opening remarks. First off, I'd say we had some nice drop-through rates on our scaled payments platforms. The mix of business was nicely favorable. We talked a little bit about timing of both periodic revenue as well as variable expenses. So the flow within an individual quarter was favorable for us in the first quarter. I would say that we certainly expect the full year to be strong and expect meaningful expansion of our operating margin on a year-over-year basis. I would not expect 270 basis points for the year. But certainly, I'm seeing nice progress both in terms of strong mix and a scalable business as well as good management of expenses. And of course, we're also benefiting from the strong operational effectiveness. You heard for the quarter, we delivered $20 million of savings on a full year expectation of $60 million, so we're off to a good great start there. Jeffery Yabuki : David, I would add a couple of things. I mean, this is -- and you know us well so you'll know this is -- this may be our highest margin ever in the Payments segment in the quarter. And to Bob's point, while we don't expect to have 270 basis points, we are at an interesting inflection point where, for the last -- call it, the last 4 quarters for sure but even a little bit before that, we were getting dragged down a bit in this segment on margin due to things like the EMV conversion. And we've got that growth as we start to transition over from having that lower margin revenue go out and the higher margin continuing to build payments and Mobiliti in these ASP solutions that we've been investing in for the last several years, as those are starting to now come online combined with the mitigation of -- I'm sorry, with the moderation of some of the investments in the Payments segment, that we would expect to see the margins really be up into this higher ZIP Code. Again to Bob's point, not as high as they are in this quarter, but we do see the nice, nice tailwind in Payments segment margins certainly throughout this year and going into next year. David Togut : Got it. Good to hear. Just a quick final question for me. The 27% free cash flow growth year-over-year in the quarter, that's obviously much higher than your annual guidance for free cash flow growth. I'm a little curious why you're not raising the free cash flow guidance for the year. And to what extent are some of the growth we saw in the first quarter onetime in nature? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, David, we feel really good about the performance in the quarter. We also recognize that this is the first quarter. We had some positive working capital benefits. And we had been taking a little bit of a hit on working capital the last couple of quarters. And so it's just too early to make that call. We like the start. We'll see where we are in the second quarter, and we'll certainly update you at that stage. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : I was wondering if you can just kind of isolate some of the factors that organic revenue growth, it was a about the strongest, I think, it's been 5 quarters. And it's very, very tight range, obviously. But maybe you could just talk through some of the one-off. I think you said there was a little bit of an early revenue recognition on some product that came through quicker than you thought. And maybe just parse out license and term fees and maybe a little currency impact. Robert Hau : You saw -- multipronged question, David. Overall, obviously a good start. We did see some benefit in the quarter of positive timing, particularly in some license and term fees that came in earlier in the quarter than we had initially anticipated. Jeffery Yabuki : Earlier in the year. Robert Hau : Earlier in the year. Q2 into Q1. Certainly like to see the performance in both segments and see the financial benefit -- the Financial segment growing a little bit nicer. Again, we certainly see some timing, and I think Jeff's opening comments, when we reiterated the full year guidance, we talked about Q2 will likely be down below Q1 levels a bit. Jeffery Yabuki : So David, let me just add -- let me add a couple of things. So we continue to see really good gains in our transactional businesses, the debit business, P2P. You heard Bob talk about real time. Now arguably, it's on a small base but 300% improvement is still 300% improvement year-over-year. We also ran a program inside the company in the first quarter that we called Fast Start, and that was really about getting people focused on driving revenue early in the year, driving sales earlier in the year so that we could shorten our conversion cycles. And that drove some nice license revenue because our sales -- a lot of our products are license oriented, and so we got a nice start there. And then -- and this is the first quarter in a while that we haven't had much FX. As you know, we don't report constant currency and so we had kind of stabilization in FX. But overall, we feel good about the start to the year, and we feel even better about our guidance for the full year. David Koning : Great. And then just one follow-up. You anniversary-ed the ACI and HP acquisition. I know they're not big. I'm just wondering maybe you can talk a little bit how those have been growing and executing and then if there's any margin impact. You talked last year about a little headwind from those 2, and margins are so good right now. I don't know if those are still a headwind or not. Jeffery Yabuki : So the HP acquisition anniversary-ed, I think, in January. And I think the ACI acquisition is kind of March-ish. And so that would have still been in the quarter in terms of the kind of no effect on internal revenue growth, and the margin would also be compressed. And those acquisitions, David, did serve to step our margins down. I want to say it was in the 20, 30 basis points in this quarter. And last year, for most of the year, it was in the 30-ish basis point range. So we are growing over that. And while we won't have any compression as it anniversaries, it did serve to put a little bit of pressure on the margin. It's one of the reasons why we feel so much better about our Payments margin. The other thing I would say is as it relates to the acquisitions, the HP acquisition was a big part of the BillMatrix Next technology that we're very enthusiastic about. We're actually going to talk about that at Investor Day. And then I mentioned that we've sold the Architect solution 14 times and have 70 institutions in the pipeline right now all looking at it. We think again that was responsive to the market. So no big revenue growth yet from those solutions but a good momentum. Mark Ernst : Yes, and the only -- this is Mark. The only thing I'd add to that is a lot of the cost takeouts, which we talked about when we did those deals, have been kind of -- we're finally getting through some of that work. Robert Hau : We're just at the early stages of starting to feel it. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Christopher Shutler : Maybe just help us reconcile the 2 kind of sales figures you gave. Sales were up 30% but quota attainment up 82%. I'm struggling a bit with whether we should view that as a good result or not. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Chris. It's -- I tried to allude to it in my remarks. The 30% year-over-year is the actual sales result versus the actual sales result last year. And as you may remember, we had kind of a weaker first quarter. But when we set our quota, we set our quota to expectations for the full year. And so we typically start out a little bit slower relative to quarter -- I'm sorry, relative to quota in Q1. So being at 82%, even though it was much higher than last year, it's still not quite where we expect us to be for the full year. For the full year, we expect to make up those 18 percentage points that we didn't get in Q1. It's not a perfectly straight line. It doesn't perfectly match our sales cycles. So 82% is actually a reasonably good start because it not only reflects the big prior year gain but it reflects our increased expectations for the year. If we get to 100, that's a very good year. Christopher Shutler : Okay. Got you. Let's see. On the cash flow, obviously a big quarter. It looks like the payable base continued to climb as they have for the last several years. How much more room is there for that story to play out? And I guess do you expect maybe not this year but over the next few years for free cash flow to start to look a little bit more like net income? Robert Hau : Obviously, cash flow is -- well, number one, a very important metric for us; and two, been a very good story. And with our guidance for 2017, we have high expectations and have started out nicely. Part of that is the basic operating performance, so strong net income, and managing that working capital. We saw working capital grow a bit in the second half of last year, particularly in receivables, and saw that come down nicely in Q1, which was a key part of the strong start to the year. We certainly anticipate continuing to manage that number down, both in terms of dollars as well as days. So it's continuing to be an opportunity for us. And certainly, measuring free cash flow as a percent of net income is an important efficiency measure on the performance there. Jeffery Yabuki : And Chris, I would expect, I mean, just based on our history, we have a strong history of running above earnings. And there's no reason to believe that won't continue given how we manage our capital outlays as well. I mean, we -- I think over the last decade, maybe we've had 2 -- 2 or 3 years where we've not been above. But we're pretty consistent there. Christopher Shutler : Okay. Got you. And then lastly at the tax benefit you guys are seeing. If we assume the current stock price, Bob, and can you give some sense of what kind of that total tax benefit associated with stock comp and RSUs would look like over the next several years, I guess, in totality? I'm just trying to figure out what that number would be. And then I think the 34% to 35% range is kind of the normalized tax rate range, right? Robert Hau : Yes. So outside of the change in accounting rules, we would typically, as you said, have a 34% to 35% tax rate. So call it 1.5, 2 points of benefit, which is, for this year, about $0.13 or $0.14. We saw a good start to the -- or a strong performance in the first quarter. That excess tax benefit will vary typically on an annual basis, come in strong in the first quarter of every year given the timing of vesting of those stock options and restricted units. That $0.13 to $0.14 is what we guided to 90 days ago when we gave first guidance. And now with the first quarter behind this, we are continuing to hold that $0.13 to $0.14. Jeffery Yabuki : And the other thing I would say is it is difficult to predict with precision what that number will be. To your point, the stock price today is quite different than the stock price was even in the middle of the first quarter. And so we're -- if you said what would -- it would extrapolate out higher now because we would have larger inherent gains in the employee equity portfolio, but you have to try to predict who's going to sell when and things like that. The $0.13, $0.14 -- I think Bob said $0.13, $0.14. I think that's really based on historical performance. I mean, to the extent that the share price moves, right, that probably gets a little bit larger but it's going to be in that range. Robert Hau : There can be some variability to this metric, which is one of the reasons why folks like me don't like having it roll through earnings per share. But given the preponderance of effect  occur in the first quarter, and that quarter now being behind us, that $0.13 to $0.14 should be in a very good shape for a full year basis. Christopher Shutler : Okay. Yes, we're just struggling with how to model is going -- I mean, figure out the valuation impact on all of our companies just given the -- basically trying to take the present value of the tax benefit and then bake in a normalized tax rate. Operator : Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Can you maybe talk about the timing of the deal pipeline as you currently see it? I think, Jeff, you commented that Q2 growth rate wouldn't be higher than Q1. So do you expect all business that slipped into 2017 to still occur in 2017? And maybe give us a sense of how that cadence of revenue growth rolls in, in Q3, Q4. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, sure, Jim. We had made a comment for modeling purposes when we gave guidance, which we don't typically do, but we had anticipated that Q1 would likely be the lowest quarter of the year and that we would see -- generally see sequential increases after that. And that was really twofold. It was what we could see on the periodic revenue front. It was not -- actually 3 reasons. It was not understanding how the new Fast Start program would impact our revenue. And then third, to your point around the ramp of sales and implementations, we -- the only thing that's going on is really the movement of the periodic revenue, as you know, and it doesn't take very much to move our -- I'm sorry, our internal revenue growth percentages. And so we -- just based on what we see right now, we think it's prudent to model to the -- saying that the second quarter will likely not be higher than the first. But there's no change. We still expect the second half of the year to be higher than the first, and we would expect the exit rate to the year to be indicative of where we're going to be in '18. James Schneider : And then maybe, Jeff, on the broad topic of regulatory reform and relief, you talked in your opening comments about some general effects. But I guess on the positive side, can you broadly talk about the impact that the CHOICE Act, if passed, would have on your business across different aspects? And then maybe on the flip side, on the negative side, can you maybe talk about if there's an ease-up of regulation at banks, whether there will be any trends that you would see that would maybe trend towards less outsourcing of core platforms rather than more? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, let me take the latter piece first. The best we can tell, there is no real -- there's no movement, and I don't see that regulatory reform will do anything other than actually -- I'm sorry, that regulatory itself will do anything other than continue to push technology burden on companies like us. And so even if the -- even if and when the technology -- I'm sorry, the regulatory burden eases a bit, because of the speed in which technology is evolving and the expectations that consumers have and their desire to have their financial institutions deliver faster, more feature-rich experiences, I don't see that having any impact. We are starting to hear a little bit of discussion on things like a hybrid computing, which is a mixture of having institutions run pieces of a platform inside their 4 walls and having us run parts of it outside the 4 walls, but that's a newer trend. The discussions around cloud and all kinds of things like that. So from our perspective, we don't see a lot of risk there. And again, we're developing more and more solutions that -- investing in more and more solutions that feel cloud-esque.  And that really is geared also to a lower TCO, and I think that will help. On the notion of CHOICE Act, I mean, my take on that is generally, if you're going to see less regulation, that's going to be a good thing. Right now, Dodd-Frank tend to do -- to provide some protection at the community bank level. We'll have to see how all this plays out. I mean, I think for now, our belief is net-net, regardless of what happens, you're going to see an easing of the implications to banks, not that consumers won't be more protected but just an easing. And that'll be good and hopefully translate to some more value for them and therefore, for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest Securities. Arvind Ramnani : You have kind of outlined a pretty good picture on kind of your core clients being in better shape, but this regulation and interest rates increased interest in digital. But can you maybe like help us kind of understand what's driving confidence in kind of second half performance? And also potentially, what can drive upside or downside to the second half ramp? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean, one of the beauties and the difficulties of our model is we sell well ahead of the implementations of a technology. And so we have a pretty good eye right now into what will get implemented in each of the, call it, the next 3 to 4 quarters. So that gives us the kind of visibility so that we have some confidence in being able to project what's going to happen. Now the downside to that is our clients are still -- they still have development cues that they have to work through. And clients have to do their share and we have to do our share. So it's not an exact science. But it does give us reasonable visibility. And we have good financial rigor in the company. We learned some lessons last year on some of the challenges that we had. And so we feel confident that we'll see accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And then just on your Payments -- your faster-growing kind of payment business, are there any specific areas within Payments that could kind of drive kind of structural or secular acceleration in growth? Or do you think that Payments is going to be better? But anything -- any specific levers that can make it grow even faster? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean, the -- in all of those businesses, if you take something like debit growth, I mean, debit is growing nicely. It's growing high single digits. And arguably, debit is, in fact, a secular trend. People are using it. The adoption curves tend to lag in the community banking market from the largest banks, and so we're riding that secular trend. Mobile banking is still very early, and so we would expect that over the next 5 to 7 to 10 years, that mobile banking will be the standard today. About 75% of consumers use online banking, and yet there's only about 40%, 50% using mobile. And so there's a lot of additional opportunity there. And then probably the last one I would point out right now is around -- is P2P. I mean, we have been pushing P2P through our Popmoney solution for the last 4 or 5 years. We are very excited about the Zelle initiative, which is Early Warning, Early Warning systems, large banks and the community banks, many of which are going through us as well as a number of the large banks. And so we think that will go from a very small business. Our current -- currently, most of the pundits are saying that, that could be as big as $300 billion come 2020 in terms of size of P2P market from a very small market today. So early, early stage in what we believe will become a secular trend over time. Those are just a few examples. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Michael Reid : This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I was looking at the integrated sales growth. That was 7 -- was that 17% last period? Jeffery Yabuki : I'm sorry. Would you repeat the question? Michael Reid : The integrated sales growth was 7% this period, down from 17% last period? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it may have been. We don't really think about it on that basis. The fourth quarter of the year is typically always your biggest quarter there. So 7% sales is pretty good growth. And the dollar value, if you look at the dollar value, that's the most important piece of that. Again, that's integrated into our sales number. Michael Reid : Okay. Got it. And with the number coming in at 20 already on the savings efficiency initiative, should we think of that amount probably coming over again this year as it did last year over the $60 million target? Or will that maybe possibly slow down a little bit? Robert Hau : Yes, some of that benefit is actually that we had a strong second half of last year, and so now that's kind of rolling into the first part of this year. So I mean, not necessarily surprising to have a strong start. It's early in the year so I'm certainly not ready to change that guidance. Some of that is new activity. And we've got a 5-year program we're in year of 2 of it at $60 million this year. At the end of year 2, at the end of this year, we'll be $120 million against the $250 million 5-year goal. So we'll be in great shape. Operator : Our last question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just I guess you had more balanced growth between the 2 segments here, Payments and Financial. Should we expect that type of growth between the 2 for the balance of 2017? Just playing around with the model here. Just trying to think about comps. Anything to call out? Robert Hau : Yes. Actually, you heard a couple of questions and Jeff's answer on the secular trends in the Payments segment. We typically see Payments slightly stronger than our Financial segment. That's been the last couple of years. And I would anticipate that to be again this year. Clearly in the first quarter, it was a bit more balanced. But overall, the trends in the Payments segment are a bit stronger than what we would see in the Financial segment. So the last couple of year trend, I think, will continue this year, by the end of the year. Jeffery Yabuki : Although, Tien-tsin, I would say that we do expect higher growth in the Financial segment. I mean, we're not giving guidance to your question. We do expect a little bit more growth in the Financial segment this year given the performance last year and some of the sales and all that. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, and that will be the [ tie-up ] which you've been talking about on the call. I guess just as a last question, Jeff, just on the M&A front, I figured I'd ask about your appetite to do acquisitions. There's been a few more deals announced, I guess, in the industry in Q1. I know PayPal was talking about the TIO Network bill payment acquisition earlier. I'm curious if your appetite has changed at all and what we might expect. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, we continue to have the same capital allocation strategy that we have had. We look at a lot. We don't buy very much but we look at a lot. And I do see opportunities for us to get into the market faster by doing some product-oriented acquisitions. So last year, we did the little -- the HPE deal. We did the CFS carveout. We did the OBS acquisition. So I think you'll see us do smaller capability-oriented acquisitions where it makes sense and it's really supportive of our strategy. I do think that's a reasonable use of capital just given how fast the market is moving right now. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We are really looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on June 20. If you have any questions, please give our team a call. Thanks so much. Have a good night. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons. Lastly, given the strategic and contextual discussion at our June 20 Investor Day, our prepared remarks for this quarter are a bit shorter than usual. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in the quarter, consistent with our expectations, given our stronger-than-expected Q1. Our performance for the first half of the year is right in line with expectations and we expect to achieve our full-year financial objectives. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share grew 10%, both of which included a large write-off in the quarter. Free cash flow through June 30 was stellar, up 26% for the period. Market momentum continued to build, with sales results up 13% sequentially and up 10% through June 30. We have a strong pipeline entering the second half of the year and expect to achieve our full year sales targets. Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2017, which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to focus on high-quality revenue, which we define as long-term and recurring with attractive margin characteristics and high free cash flow conversion. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, which we highlighted on our last quarterly call would likely be lower than Q1, led by lending solutions, card services and investment services. Internal revenue growth was consistent with our expectations at 4% in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 10 basis points and is up 40 basis points for the year-to-date. These results include : $15 million of unusual expenses in the quarter, which Bob will discuss in a few minutes; adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 10%, which includes the $0.05 of additional expense I just referenced; adjusted EPS for the first half of the year was up 14%; and our continued focus on free cash flow delivered 26% growth through June 30. Again, we're on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. At our investor conference, we spoke to the importance of digital in the account processing decision process. During the quarter, we signed Dime Community Bank, a $6 billion asset institution to a new technology stack led by DNA, and a full digital suite, including Commercial Center and Architect, along with other security and payments products to enhance customer value. Our newly acquired digital solutions have meaningfully enhanced our value proposition, leading to pipeline growth, increased sales and market momentum. We signed 6 new DNA account processing clients in the quarter, including 4 with assets greater than $1 billion. We're also seeing growing momentum in the large \"end of the credit union\" market as these institutions appear to be even more focused on exploring modern technology and value-added bundles. We had 6 DNA clients go live in the quarter and expect at least 10 more this year. We crossed the $6 million mark for Mobiliti ASP subscribers in the quarter, representing nearly 30% growth over the prior year and 7% sequentially. Mobiliti business has also continued to expand as we have almost 300 live clients, with subscribers growing 17% sequentially and more than doubling as of June 30. We continue to invest in digitally oriented technologies, including the announcement of a recommended cash offer to acquire Monitise in the quarter, which we expect will enhance our footprint, accelerate digital time-to-market and provide additional flexibly for our clients. We remain bullish on the role of digital differentiation in our overarching value proposition. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. As you know, Zelle launched nationwide in June, with Fiserv clients composing nearly 40% of the launch group. The demand for Fiserv to power Zelle for the broad market continues, resulted in signings of 3 additional top 25 banks in the quarter. We believe that Popmoney and Zelle are key as consumers adopt bank-based P2P as their preferred way to move money. Three of our newer products were recognized for innovation in the quarter by the Retail Banker International Awards. Immediate Funds and Agiliti were named as finalists for the Product Innovation of the Year; and Verifast, our Palm-based biometric solution, was named the Security Innovation of the Year and was also a finalist for Best Consumer-Focused Product. Well placed innovation drives client value, builds differentiation and supports high-quality revenue growth. We continue to pursue our multi-pronged approach to securing innovation : build, buy and partner. As you saw earlier today, we announced the acquisition of PCLender. Their solution provides enhanced end-to-end retail loan-origination capabilities and better positions us to serve our clients' customers when and where they want it. PCLender is already integrated into most of our larger account processing platforms, which will allow us to hit the ground running. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenues for the quarter grew 2% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $2.6 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and was 4% year-to-date, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, such as the sale of the Australian item-processing business, which closed in Q2. As we shared in our Q1 call, we expect our second quarter internal revenue growth rate to be lower than the first quarter due primarily to timing between periods. The 4% internal growth rate for the first half of the year is consistent with our expectations. Adjusted operating income in the quarter, which includes the unusual expense items Jeff mentioned upfront, increased 3% to $424 million, and is up 5% year-to-date to $853 million. Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points to 32.0% in the quarter and increased 40 basis points for the first half of the year to 32.3%. The $15 million charge in the quarter was in the Payments segment and was for 2 separate projects, which have been in process for the last year or so. Included in that total is a $10 million non-cash impairment of previously capitalized development costs, which were written off upon the termination of the projects. Unfortunately, developing innovative solutions can occasionally lead to projects that may not come to fruition. With that said, we have a strong track record of success and will continue to identify opportunities to invest in market-leading innovation. The impact of the $15 million expense item on the company is about 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin headwind in the quarter, 60 basis points year-to-date and $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share. But for this, adjusted operating margin in the quarter would have expanded 130 basis points and adjusted EPS would have increased by 15% on the strength of high-quality revenue growth, combined with continued outstanding performance against our operational efficiency initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 10% to $1.19 and was up 14% for the first half of the year to $2.43. We believe we are well positioned to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue was $716 million in the quarter and $1.4 million for the first 6 months of the year. Internal revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter and is up 4% in the first half of the year. The segment performance was led by strong results in card services and investment services. The lower growth rate in the sequential quarter is primarily related to EMV. And we saw strong EMV implementation  ramp in 2016. And while absolute growth continues in 2017, the rate of growth is lower following the initial wave of EMV issuance. Payments and Digital continue to drive value for our clients and our customers, and along those lines, we experienced high single-digit debit volume growth and P2P transactions were up over 20% in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers also performed well in the period, expanding by nearly 30%. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect strong mobile adoption for the foreseeable future. Payments segment adjusted operating income in the quarter was up slightly from the prior year at $239 million and is up 8% to $499 million for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points in the quarter to 33.3%. The write-off I mentioned a few moments ago compressed the segment margin by 210 basis points in the quarter. Stated differently, adjusted operating margin would have been up 110 basis points without the charge. And for the first half of the year, adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 34.7%, which is the highest first half adjusted operating margin ever achieved in the Payments segment. Turning to the Financial segment. Adjusted revenue was $623 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, versus 1% internal growth in the comparable quarter and comparable prior year. Internal revenue growth was led by our lending solutions and account processing businesses. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $214 million for the quarter and was $410 million for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 34.3% in the quarter on the strength of better top line results and favorable expense management. In Q1, we referenced the timing of expenses had pressured the segment margin, which moderated as expected. For the first half of the year, adjusted operating margin of the segment was up 20 basis points to 33.0%. Corporate and Other results in the quarter was generally in line sequentially and with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which was consistent with our expectations, including the excess tax benefit of share-based compensation. And we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be slightly below 33%, which assumes a higher rate in the second half of the year due to the timing of the tax benefits. Our free cash flow for the first half of the year was excellent at $555 million, an increase of 26% compared to prior year. Free cash flow conversion, which is free cash flow divided by adjusted net income, is our replacement cash flow guidance measure described at Investor Day and was 105% for the first half of the year. As a reminder, in connection with the SEC comment letter, we agreed to stop reporting free cash flow per share, and we've provided a full reconciliation of free cash flow conversion on Page 14 of the supplemental materials, including the GAAP to non-GAAP details as well as highlighted weighted average share counts for the applicable time periods. Total debt outstanding was $4.7 billion as of June 30 or 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $295 million and through June 30, we have returned $684 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million shares. There were 210.8 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter and 14.6 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales in the second quarter were down 3% due to the timing of prior year sales and up 10% for the first half of the year. Quota attainment, which reflects our expectations of increased performance, came in at 82%. Our domestic pipeline was up 20% through June 30 and was up 11% sequentially. We fully expect to achieve our full year sales target. Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, driven primarily by Payments and Digital solutions. We expect to see a further build of our integrated sales results as the biller solutions strategy shared at Investor Day gains traction. Our ability to extend client relationships through add-on solutions remains a critical element of our strategy. We had another excellent quarter for operational effectiveness with results coming in at $20 million. Savings were led by workforce optimization, procurement and data center consolidation. Through the midpoint of the year, we are well ahead of plan at $40 million. We fully expect to exceed our operational effectiveness goal of $60 million for the full year. Payment speed and solution proliferation continue to grab many of the industry headlines, which we didn't discuss in depth at our Investor Day. The combined impact of rising expectations, digital ubiquity and payment speed is changing the way people approach financial services and meaningfully impacting the size and shape of FinTech. More recently, we're pleased to see more approvals of de novo bank charters, which creates new opportunities for market participants. We remain fully committed to our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2017 internal revenue growth of 4% to 5% and anticipated higher revenue growth exit rate going into 2018. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.03 to $5.17, and that adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points. Finally, we expect our new cash flow metric, free cash flow conversion, to be in a range of 108% to 111% of adjusted net income for the year. We're positioned well going into the second half of the year. We're on pace to meet our financial commitments and are investing organically and via acquisition to ensure your company is driving accelerated revenue growth, strong operating margin and excellent free cash flow for years to come. Our success is a product of the more than 23,000 associates who display commitment, dedication and excellence for clients and shareholders each and every day. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about the acceleration in the second half. Can you kind of list through the drivers there, talk about your general confidence level that we're going to see, the expected acceleration? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Thanks, Ramsey. So I'll take it and Bob and Mark can add in as needed. I would say -- I guess, I would say, first of all, we're confident that we're going to see the acceleration, and it's really 5 or 6 items, and I'll just tick through them. First is, remember, we had quite strong sales last year in the second half of the year and we expect that, along with the Fast Start program we had in Q1, to make a contribution in the second half of the year. Second, and really a derivative of that, is the larger implementations that we have been talking about will come online kind of towards the end of third, fourth quarter. And that includes the 10 DNA transactions that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. As we shared at Investor Day, we're going to have some early biller strategy contributions from some of the bundled value propositions, which will come online in Q4 and ramp through '18, and so we're excited about that. We have some contributions coming from acquisitions as they go from exclusion to being organic, and most of that will probably be an add-in, in Q2, so we expect to have those implementations, and then some processing continuing to build throughout the year and again into '18. And we expect all of that to lead to a pretty strong exit rate as we move into 2018. Ramsey El-Assal: And that's tremendously helpful. And then on the EMV headwind that you called out or that you [indiscernible] your year-over-year compare, what's the cadence of that last year? When should we start to see that really abating? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, so we're still seeing absolute growth. It's just the growth contribution itself is down a bit. And I don't think we're going to see an abatement. I think we're now at a level that we'll see over the next few quarters, and we won't really see that abate until we're at the point where we start to see a new contactless cycle, and I think we're well away from that. So I think we're starting to see -- we're kind of moving into this normal level of EMV issuance. What I would say is we will expect to see continuing uplift in debit processing as the unlocking of the EMV chip adds revenue. So as more and more EMV comes online, we'll see an uplift in our processing revenues. But that will be slowly as the cards themselves move into circulation and utilization. Operator : Our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. David Koning : I guess, to follow up on the last question just a little bit. I guess, in the Payments segment, specifically, it's often in Q2 kind of flat to up $20 million or so sequentially, and this year was down $4 million. So it almost feels like there -- was there anything else other than EMV? Because I know you said EMV's not really a downdraft, it's more stable. I'm just wondering if there was either weak term fees or license or anything else that contributed a little, too. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. No, it's a good question, Dave. So we had obviously, the EMV that we talked about. We had -- and we talked about this a little bit in Q1, we had some periodic revenue last year that we saw in Q2 that we got in Q1 this year. The other thing I would say is last year, we were 6% in Q2, 7% in the first half of the year in payments. So the compare was a little bit tougher. A lot of that buoyed by EMV. But we're still really bullish about the growth in the segment, and we expect that to be the big driver of acceleration in the second half of the year. David Koning : Got you. Yes, that totally makes sense. And just secondly, I mean the acquisitions coming out, I mean that's pretty exciting, Monitise and PCLender. What's the timing? Like should we just think of that as kind of a end of Q3-type event? And maybe, what rough revenue should we expect? Jeffery Yabuki : So PCLender is actually announced and closed, so that is now -- they're -- the PCLender folks are part of the family so we're excited to have them in here. PCLender is a fairly small business, Dave. You made a notation in your note. I would say that I don't expect that to have any meaningful impact. Obviously, it's not organic revenue until we anniversary. We bought that primarily because they've got some really good people and they've got a really good origination solution. And with people moving to digital, we see the importance of origination technologies, merging it with the digital experiences. And so that's something that we've been looking to add in for the last, oh, I would say 12 to 24 months, so we're happy to have that in the family. Monitise, which we made a recommended cash offer to their shareholders, we had said all along that we thought that transaction was likely a Q3-type transaction and that's still our current belief. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. David Togut : Jeff, you called out strength in the large credit union market, growing momentum, and congrats on the Dime win. Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on what's driving that strength? And is this more kind of outsourcing, competitive takeaways? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so David, I was really talking about competitive takeaways. We're seeing more and more activity in the large -- in the larger credit union space. As you know, D+H had a transaction earlier this year. And typically when those transactions occur, it tends to have people take a look at their provider, and we're seeing that going on. And what's interesting to us is that we're seeing, especially in bake-offs where it's not our client today, we're seeing this -- we're seeing the participants, the credit unions really wanting the newer technology. And so, as you know well, that is the forte of DNA. There are a couple of other small providers out there who are dealing with -- or I'm sorry, who are offering the newer, modern architecture, and their -- as between us and those types of providers, we're seeing more decisions going in that direction. So for us, we're excited, given how locked up that space had been for the last several years. David Togut : Understood. That's helpful. And then, you called out the outperformance and operational effectiveness. It looks like you're 2/3 of the way through the $60 million target at the midpoint of the year. What are the major drivers of outperformance on cost takeout? Robert Hau : So Dave, it's Bob. I would really point to, actually the 3 things that Jeff mentioned in his opening comments. Workforce optimization has certainly been a key driver. That's been part of the acceleration or the bigger savings that we saw versus the first half of last year. We continue to see good progress in our procurement space as well as data center optimization beginning to really take hold. So we're certainly pleased with the progress in the second half of the year, and as Jeff said, at this point, we expect to overdrive or overachieve against the $60 million full-year outlook that we had in place. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I think the other thing, David, is as you know, we built a lot of muscle in the Fiserv machine around this, and it's always an estimate at the beginning of the year on how we're going to do and the progress that we're going to make, especially when we're relatively early in a program as we are with the current phase. And part of what gave Bob the confidence to be quite bullish at our Investor Day is the progress that we're making this year. One of the things that we're also working on that we didn't talk about but it's important is over the last quarter -- or the last several quarters and just going live this week, we moved our Architect platform to the cloud. And that kind of work, which is part of this, doesn't drive any definitive cost sales now but it allows us to provide a fully cloud-based solution, digital solution, to our customers -- or sorry, to our clients, but also over time, the economic benefits of being cloud-enabled are very, very, very substantial. So we're finding that mix between making investments and doing things that are going to pay off today and making investments and taking actions that are really setting ourselves up for the next phase that Bob referenced at our recent Investor Day. David Togut : Understood. Quick final question for me. If we strip out the write-off in the Payments business, it looked like you continue to have nice margin expansion there. How much of that is driven by the 30% Mobiliti ASP growth? And to what extent is that type of growth sustainable? Jeffery Yabuki : So there are really a few drivers to that, and I'll probably miss some of it and so Bob will add in. There's certainly a little bit of it -- or some of it coming through from Mobiliti and the ASP technology. And most of that is just because, as you know, most of our investments are big investments, are fixed-cost investments, and then the revenue that comes through is at a pretty high margin and so we're seeing that. But we're seeing that drop through on many of our products. So whether it's debit or our ACH-processing platform or whatever the scale payments platforms are, those are going to make those contributions. We're also making a little less organic investment in the segment right now. We have been making significant investments, as you know, around EMV. That's now fully scaled. The other thing is that because we are now anniversary-ing against EMV, right, the margin itself, we're not getting a lot of lower -- a little bit lower incremental margins. So your point about backing the $15 million out, I mean, those margins are quite high. And I think as Bob mentioned in his remarks, the 34.7% margin for the first half of the year is the highest first half margin we've ever had in payments. Robert Hau : And that number includes the $15 million charge. Right. Jeffery Yabuki : The $15 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens. Brett Huff : Two questions. One, can you give us just more thoughts on the P2P? You mentioned some really nice rollouts and some good numbers. How was the  working with the broader umbrella of Zelle? It sounds like it's benefiting you guys, particularly given it sounds like you got a lot of people in the first class of go-lives. Any insights in the first month or so since that's been live? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say that as -- I'll put this in air quotes. \"As bank consortia go that the Zelle Group, the former clearXchange, EWS Group is -- has worked together well and we have a very strong relationship with them, which has allowed us to be close to the decisions and be on top of what we need to be doing to make sure that our clients, and frankly, new clients that we're winning already be not only -- that as you know, we have well over 2,000 institutions who are or have been Popmoney institutions. And so we expect many of those, if not all of those, over time, to become part of \"Zelle\". But we're also winning few clients. Of the few that we mentioned today, of the top 25, 1 of those 3 was brand new to the company. And I can think of a large -- or sorry, a number of institutions who are just coming in because we happen to have the payments -- the DDA-based payments expertise and, frankly, the most working knowledge in the industry around P2P. So -- and remember, the importance of P2P is not just moving money, but it's having the mature risk capabilities and network capabilities that we have been working on, frankly since 2011. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then any update on the OBS and the cash management consolidation or the investments you're making there? We're looking around and seeing there's a number of new entrants, be it another core processor is going to have an organic version. There's a lot of people who seem to kind of be reinvesting in that as processors go out for that. Any thoughts on that market, how it's developing and how you guys feel about the position? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean, the commercial cash management is really important because institutions are serving generally the -- who they would view as their most important clients with that technology. And it's the intermediary technology that the commercial customers are using many, many, many times per day, and so it's critical. Now we have -- we had, for many years, a very strong kind of mid-market technology, but it just -- we didn't think that was sufficient to meet the rising expectations that we see out in digital, and so buying OBS, as you know, brought that to the party. Frankly, we have -- even as bullish and as optimistic  as we were with that acquisition at the time, the combination of OBS to allow institutions to serve their large commercial customers -- and as you know, this goes all the way up through the sizing of banks, the Cap One and SunTrust are both large OBS customers. So we have the ability to serve very large and commercial customers. So for us, that combination with Architect has really been quite powerful in the market. It really is -- it has -- in the early days, retail was more important in the -- because so many institutions were interacting with the -- I'm sorry, so many customers were interacting with the FIs on that basis, but commercial is now absolutely critical. And the ability to go out and win larger, bundled deals like the Dime Community Bank that we talked about today, is quite important. So we're excited about it, and we think that's going to lead us to a lot of new business over the next several years. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So I guess, my first question is on free cash flow performance, pretty solid in the first half. But as your internal growth recovers in the second half and, also, you have ongoing digital investments, would you expect the free cash flow performance to sort of decelerate in the second half? The reason I asked is your new FCF metric would support this, but on the other hand, you've got cost initiatives, the Fast Start program, which would indicate otherwise. So can you comment on expected free cash flow performance? Robert Hau : Yes, Ashwin, it's Bob. I would say overall, obviously, we're very pleased with where we started the first half of the year, up meaningful over the prior year. I certainly wouldn't anticipate that level of year-over-year growth to continue into the balance of the year, but we certainly expect to have a very strong free cash flow. The guidance on the free cash flow conversion metric is 108% to 111%. We fully expect to achieve that through the first half of the year. We're at 105%, but off to a great start. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. And second question is, I guess, on competitive landscape. And Jeff, I get your comments that you had on Misys-D+H. But on the other hand, Temenos, on its call indicated a strong pipeline. They won Commerce Bank, Avidbank, in the past year or so. Obviously, 2 clients against the thousands you had. Small, but they're good-sized banks, not something that happens too often. And the question really becomes, you're going to be increasingly fighting cloud-based deals, Architect and -- against Temenos and so on. How does that affect the economics of your business that needed CapEx and so on? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, that's a good question, Ashwin. Obviously, the Commerce deal was something that we were battling for as well, and we did not end up getting selected. The difference between that kind of a transaction or the Ally transaction, where, in many of the smaller institutions -- and I don't mean that negatively, but the smaller institutions will tend to buy on a bundled basis. In the larger clients, that's not the case. So Commerce bought -- may have bought a core engine, but we actually provide them many of their digital and payment solutions. And so as you move up that food chain, winning the core processing capability is certainly important and something we'd like to do, but we still have many relationships with these institutions. And in this case, the core provider doesn't have the capabilities to displace us, and so it is a little bit different than you see in other parts of the landscape. The other thing I would say is those larger clients, as much as we'd like to win them, they tend to be multiyear, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year kinds of implementations. And frankly, it's a lot of services revenue, and for us, we don't think that's necessarily our sweet spot. We really are building our company to be in the -- call it, in the $25 billion and less space on the bundled value proposition. Now we'll move up and we have clients that are larger than that. And for clients who want the modern technologies that we provide and they want an integration advantage, then that's great. But if they're really looking for  very heavy, professional services and license-type transaction, we have to evaluate each one of those and make a determination. Is it somewhere where we want to play, and are we best suited to deliver that given the opportunity costs associated with those kinds of transactions? Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Jeff, in the prepared comments, you talked about the number of DNA wins you expect to come on back half of the year as well as some Mobiliti means you expect to come on later this year. Can you maybe give us a sense about the relative magnitude of both of those items, and then whether you expect these to kind of be more Q4 events or whether we can see some contribution in Q3 as well? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So on DNA, we generally would expect those to be probably even. I think we said at least 10, 5 and 5-ish. And -- but remember, you've got the aggregate effect of that because we had 6 go-live in this quarter. So -- but we would expect to see that. And then as it relates to payments, we would expect to see -- my guess is, most of those implementations will bias to Q4 just because it takes time  to get them implemented and get the UIs where they want to be. So that'll probably bias a little bit more to Q4. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then maybe to follow up on an earlier question for you, Bob. Can you maybe give us a status update in terms of the -- on the data center part of operational effectiveness, what actions you took in the quarter, and then whether you think that there's any potential to kind of pull in any of the planned 2018 actions to 2017, given you're running ahead of plan? Robert Hau : Yes, I would say, overall, the favorability or the strength of the overall OE savings, the $40 million in the first half of the year, I think we described it as workforce optimization, procurement and TCO, I would put them in that order in terms of the actual savings generated, with TCO being a relatively modest contributor at this point. We're still in the phase of getting that activity ramped up and expect to see that in the latter part of the current phase of the program. Jeffery Yabuki : Jim, I would say that the way to think about TCO is there are very long planning tails on that. And if you move up something by a month or by 2 months, right, which is unlikely, right, they're usually right up to the expected time, you'd get only a tiny benefit. So the majority of the increment is -- doesn't come from TCO. We would have to start doing things now to see benefits at the end of, probably at the end of '18 into early '19. So just think about it, those are longer-tailed activities. Operator : Our next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Paulo Ribeiro : Jeff, last quarter, you talked about Fast Start, and could you just tell -- give an update how is that going? Or was that more specific for first quarter in terms of shortening conversion cycles and driving revenue early into the year? And second and kind of a related question here is on receivables, we also saw last quarter you were able to bring it down and you did it again this quarter. Do you anticipate that you'd continue to bring it down in terms of U.S. dollars and days in the second half of the year? Mark Ernst : So let me -- this is Mark Ernst. Let me start with the kind of what our learning is on the Fast Start. Overall, I think we would just judge that some of the things that we did demonstrated that we do have the ability to, within range, kind of move some of the sales activity forward. We're pretty encouraged by that. It's unclear at this point whether that results in more overall sales, but it does have the effect of bringing in transactions that we can't implement more quickly and, therefore, get a fourth quarter effect that might have otherwise slipped into the subsequent year. So overall, I'd say we are pleased with what we saw so far with Fast Start, but kind of the full -- and the full effects of it, I think, are still things that we're working through. Robert Hau : And then in terms of accounts receivable, Paulo, it's -- we saw some ramp up, if you recall, into the second half of last year. We saw that come down nicely in Q1 and again in Q2 to a slightly lesser extent but still an improvement. I would expect us to be able to maintain it from a days' standpoint, with some growth in revenue in the second half of the year, accelerated growth. We'll continue to work that receivable and generate good cash for the full year. Jeffery Yabuki : Paulo,  one thing I would add to the Fast Start commentary is when we created the program, we had a thesis that if it were to work, we would likely see more increases in product-oriented, license-oriented product revenue. And in fact, what we ended up seeing was some of that but actually more sales of, whether they be in-house to outsourced migrations, but other kinds of revenue that is more recurring that we thought had longer cycles. And we saw people work hard to bring them in early. And to Mark's point, that revenue, instead of slipping into the earlier part of '18, because it wouldn't have gotten signed until the middle of the year or later in the year, we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that rev come in, in Q4. But that was an interesting learning. The ability to move clients on the decision cycle on even longer recurring revenue kinds of add-on sales. Paulo Ribeiro : Great color. Just if I can sneak one more in. Just quickly, generally, in terms of IT spend, do you see some change this quarter versus last quarter in terms of where banks are putting their dollars? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say generally, no, with one exception, and that is that, especially in the larger banks, Zelle is taking a lot of the mind share, people wanting to get on the Zelle bandwagon before the consortium starts its advertising and marketing. But really, the priorities remain the same : focused on digital experience, commercial, making money, those kinds of things. And there continues to be a bit of optimism in the market on rates and those kinds of things. So -- but it's about -- the spend itself is about the same. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff and Mark maybe, sort of a longer-term question, understandably a lot of enthusiasm about Zelle and the ramp and the visibility it creates for your organic revenue growth for the back half and beyond. Can you shed a little light on how you see the longer-term nature of those contracts going onwards? I imagine there are some minimums upfront and, at some point, it transitions over into either user-based pricing or transaction-based pricing. How would you expect that revenue stream to evolve? Jeffery Yabuki : So I think at Investor Day, Mark had laid out some -- I think using iPay data, laid out a -- kind of how the P2P market would grow. And so we, none of us, have a crystal ball, and there's lots of hypothecation out there. But we generally think that hypothesis is as good as any of them. But we do think that P2P is going to grow. And P2P is going to end up being an important part of how consumers move money as compared to the check and cash that generally P2P payments are focused with today. So most of our pricing is transactional. And so as transactions grow, we would expect to follow that kind of growth, much like we did in the bill payment business and the early days of CheckFree when it went from very little up to being quite significant. And so we do expect that. Right now, the majority of the revenue, the new revenue that's being created, is still small in the transactional side and much more around implementation, so services and the like. So that's how we see that. And again, I expect that to happen -- we expect that to happen over quite a long period of time in terms of having the market grow to some level of quasi-maturity. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. So -- and I imagine, given the sort of rolling nature of these implementations, it gives you some time line as far as end-user adoption. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, and we're going to be -- just given the size of our base and the demand in the market, we're going to be implementing people for a long time. We literally have thousands of implementations -- we're going to have thousands of implementations to do. So that is going to be a nice bridge while the transactions themselves are building. The other really important element of this is we believe that as people become more fluent users with P2P that, in fact, that will also translate to other DDA-based payments, so more bank-based bill pay, more account-to-account transfer, more activity used in the personal payments device that we refer to as a phone. So all of that, we think, will turn into goodness across our DDA-based payment suites. Suite. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Condra from Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse. Paul Condra : Jeff, I just wanted to ask, you talked about some de novo activity that looked positive. I wondered if you could give a little more detail there and talk about what you're seeing. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I think we're actually now into the double digits of de novos this year. So I think we're around 10. We're  in that high single-digit, low double-digit range, and there are lots of applications in there. And so we're optimistic now. It doesn't sound like a lot relative to the past, but frankly, that's probably as many de novos as we've seen in the last 3 to 4 years combined. So we're feeling good about that. Paul Condra : I mean, is there anything that stands out to you as to why that activity would be picking up? Just where we are in the cycle, interest rates or... Jeffery Yabuki : I think it's a combination of bank regulators being more comfortable with the stability of the market, and frankly, the ability to make a little bit more money as rates have been moving up. But there's been a lot of demand for de novos for a while. It's really just been the regulators who have not been willing to approve charters. Paul Condra : And then, I guess, nice job maintaining the outlook even with the $0.05 hit. Bob, I was just curious if you would be -- would have been raising your EPS outlook for the year if you didn't have that one-time expense issue. Robert Hau : Yes, that's an interesting hypothetical question. The fact is we've done well from an operational efficiency standpoint, having $40 million behind us and now expecting to overachieve the $60 million. Now a $0.05 headwind certainly is an impact to the overall guidance range. It's got $0.14 in it. Certainly disappointed that we have the charge, but still feel good about, a, having record operating margin in the quarter, both for the Payments segment as well as the overall company; and being able to maintain the guidance. Jeffery Yabuki : I mean, those kinds of hypotheticals are almost impossible to answer. I would say that historically by the time we get to Q2, we have a pretty good feel for how the rest of the year is going to shake out on the EPS side. We're highly confident in our EPS range for the year, and so -- and that's taking the $0.05 in. So I would say that we would be even more confident if we weren't making up for that $0.05. We are excited about the fact that next year, right, that $0.05 will not recur, and that's good news. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : I was wondering if you could update us on the growth initiatives, especially given the charge, maybe what's working and what isn't? Jeffery Yabuki : Are you talking about the growth initiatives that we talked about at Investor Day? Joseph Foresi : That's right. I wasn't sure if the charge was linked to it. Maybe if you could give us an update on -- or more detail on the charge and any update on how the growth initiatives are after the Investor Day? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say that nothing has changed since Investor Day. We're -- with those items. The charge had nothing to do with the growth initiatives that we laid out. It really had to do with some internally used software. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then just on the pipeline, I know you gave some color earlier, but how does the pipeline for the second half look versus the first half? And maybe you can give us some color on some expectations on your conversion rate assumptions. Are they the same in the second half as the first half? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, sure. We have good growth in our pipe. We are up in sales about 10% for the year. We expect our win rates to remain about the same. We have some larger transactions that are in the pipeline. And we're also filling the pipeline nicely against some of the strategic initiatives that we talked about. So we basically -- we have confidence in the numbers, and we're comfortable that we'll make the full-year sales. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim. Jeffrey Cantwell : Just wanted to get your thoughts on the potential impact on your margin Zelle could have, looking a little further out, as it ramps  more meaningfully. You mentioned this quarter, ex the one-time item, operating margin would have been up significantly. So I'm wondering if Zelle's ramp would mean you could do even better looking out into 2018? Or just how you would think about quantifying this impact. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So the best -- probably the best way to think about Zelle is in the kind of the foreseeable -- in the foreseeable future. So as we're going through our implementation cycles, the majority of the revenue that comes in on that conversion and implementations is different -- has different characteristics than the transactional revenue. When the transactions start to bypass the implementation revenue, we would expect those kinds of margins to look very similar to all of the other large payments processing engines that we have in the company, whether they be debit or bill pay or the like. So we would expect, over time -- without regard to pricing, we would expect over time that those margins would look pretty attractive. All right. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a great evening. Operator : That concludes today's conference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, anticipated benefits related to acquisitions and our strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from the actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We made important strategic progress in the quarter through several acquisitions, which further expanded our solution set in the fast growing areas of payments infrastructure and digital enablement. We expect these transactions to enrich the differentiation of our solutions, deliver meaningful value to our clients and further enhance our internal revenue growth profile. Although we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, revenue in the third quarter was below our expectations. This shortfall was driven primarily by the timing of periodic revenue, the majority of which we expect to reverse in Q4, contributing to a strong internal revenue growth exit rate and setting the stage for higher growth in 2018. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter, pressured by a $16 million reduction in periodic revenue versus the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was also impacted by a tough comparison for EMV card production revenue growth versus last year's third quarter. Even with the decline in higher-margin periodic revenue, adjusted earnings per share was up 11% in the quarter and has increased 13% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down slightly versus the prior year to 32.6%, and up 60 basis points sequentially. This comparison is against last year's high watermark for adjusted operating margin and also includes a 40 basis point headwind from our 2017 acquisitions. Sales performance in the quarter stepped up, coming in at 106% of quota and is now at 91% attainment year-to-date. Our pipeline remains strong, and we are on track to meet our full year sales objectives. Now let me update you on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2017 which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and finally, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue in the quarter even in the face of lower-than-anticipated headline growth. The combination of lower periodic revenue and a decline in the revenue growth contribution from EMV impacted our comparative quarterly internal revenue growth rate by roughly 230 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We've raised the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance and now expect results in the range of 14% to 16% growth for the year. We are well on our way to achieving our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Our business continues to demonstrate strong adjusted operating margin and free cash flow characteristics. Adjusted operating margin through September 30 is up 20 basis points, which includes 20 basis points of compression from our recent acquisitions. Free cash flow is up 10% year-to-date, and we're on pace for another strong performance year across all of our key free cash flow metrics. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We talked at length about the importance of providing strategic solutions across our account processing client base. To that end, we were pleased to expand our relationship with Prosperity Bank in the quarter. With more than $22 billion of assets, the bank selected our market-leading Architect, Commercial Center and debit processing solutions to transform their digital and payments experiences. We're seeing tremendous market momentum since adding these solutions to our market leading digital suite. We were pleased to renew our important relationship with NCR this quarter as a reseller of payment services through their digital insights solutions. This multi-year agreement enriches our long-standing bill payment partnership and helps both parties extend their payments leadership. Mobiliti ASP subscribers were up more than 20% in the quarter and increased 4% sequentially to 6.4 million. Mobiliti business has also continued to expand with users nearly doubling from the prior year's quarter. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to believe Zelle is an important catalyst to change the way consumers move money. As the leader in FI-centric P2P, we are encouraged by additional Zelle signings, progress on client implementations and as you have likely seen, early signs of very strong transaction growth. BMO Harris Bank, part of the BMO Financial Group, a highly diversified financial services provider based in North America, has signed with Fiserv to bring new capabilities and an integrated money movement platform to their customers in the U.S. using our market leading CheckFree RXP, TransferNow and Zelle solutions. We also signed Regents Bank to our turnkey Zelle solution in the quarter, bringing to 8 the number of top 25 banking institutions that to date have opted for our full Zelle solution. While still really in the decision, implementation and adoption cycle, we remain encouraged by the market enthusiasm for Zelle and expect to see measurable growth in 2018 and well into the future. As we introduced earlier in the year, our new integrated biller strategy offers a unique value proposition across several key solution areas. As one of our early proof points, Freedom Mortgage, a leading mortgage lender, expanded its existing relationship by adding LoanComplete to enable faster, more efficient loan processing while reducing overall risk. Our new strategy is already producing sales, which is further increasing our conviction around this unique approach to integrated client value. As I mentioned, we closed 3 acquisitions in the quarter to help drive innovation and client value, including PCLender, which strengthens our portfolio of digital lending products through next-generation mortgage origination technology. In September, we closed the acquisition of Monitise, which we expect will accelerate both our digital strategy and the development of a next-generation digital banking platform. Importantly, the Co-operative Bank in the U.K. with assets of GBP 25 billion became the first client to purchase our newly acquired FINkit solution. Interest has grown since our acquisition, and we expect this to be first of many sales of this unique digital capability. We also acquired Dovetail Group Limited, a leading provider of payments and liquidity management solutions. Dovetail's payments platform, which is one of the top payments infrastructure solutions in the world, enables Fiserv to help financial institutions transform their payments infrastructure to meet the changing needs of wholesale, commercial and retail customers. Dovetail positions us as a leader in the rapidly growing global payments market. Reaction to these acquisitions has been excellent, and we are optimistic about our ability to deliver differentiated client value while further extending our growth profile. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 2% to $1.3 billion and increased 3% to $4 billion through September 30. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and is 3% for the year-to-date. While the third quarter's internal revenue growth rate was lower than we anticipated, it was largely driven by the $16 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue, the majority of which was in the Financial segment. In addition, we had a large comparative EMV growth headwind in the quarter, which pressured both overall internal revenue growth as well as in the Payments segment. As we've shared throughout the year, we expected internal revenue growth to accelerate into the second half of the year. This is still the case as we expect our fourth quarter's results to include much of the periodic revenue delayed in Q3 and to be our strongest internal revenue growth quarter for the year. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 1% to $435 million and is up 4% through September 30 to $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.6% was down 20 basis points in the quarter and is up 20 basis points for the year-to-date to 32.4%. Current year acquisitions had a 40 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Absent the acquisitions, adjusted operating margin would have been up 20 basis points in the quarter and up 40 basis points year-to-date. As a footnote, the reduction in periodic revenue in the quarter had an 80 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margin in the third quarter. Our results are benefiting from the combination of high-quality recurring revenue and exceptional operational effectiveness program execution, which has already surpassed our full year target of $60 million. We are on pace for at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the year, which includes headwind from acquisitions as well as the write-off we discussed in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.27 in the quarter and is up 13% to $3.71 for the first 9 months of the year, setting the stage for another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 5%, both in the quarter and year-to-date, to $733 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. Segment internal revenue growth was led by strong results in both card services and electronic payments, partially offset by the difficult compare from EMV card production. Last year's third quarter was the peak revenue period for EMV card production, and although we're still seeing revenue build from EMV, the growth is at a more normalized level. And a major step-up in growth contribution from EMV revenue anniversaries in fourth quarter. Our debit transaction growth in the quarter was in the mid-single digits, and P2P transactions grew 20%. Real-time transactions were up more than 100% in the quarter, led by growth in Popmoney Instant Payments. As Jeff noted, early Zelle transaction growth is strong albeit off of a very small base, and we remain optimistic about the near to midterm growth potential for P2P. Payments segment adjusted operating income in the quarter was up 5% to $254 million and is up 7% to $753 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 34.6% and is up 60 basis points to 34.7% through September 30. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $619 million in the quarter and $1.9 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was flat in the quarter due primarily to the timing of license and termination fee revenue, which had a negative impact on segment internal revenue growth of more than 200 basis points. For the first 9 months of the year, the segment's internal revenue growth rate was 2%, a step-up over the 1% growth last year. Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $204 million for the quarter and $614 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 33.1% in the quarter, driven largely by the timing of the high-margin periodic revenue. And for the first 9 months of the year, adjusted operating margin in the segment was flat at 33%. An important driver of the Financial segment's success is our account processing footprint. Our DNA continued its market momentum, adding 9 clients in the quarter as compared to 5 in the prior year. And we've signed 20 clients to DNA for the year-to-date, and 5 DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 2 with assets greater than $1 billion.  Corporate and other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.1%. This is better than anticipated due primarily to the successful resolution of several discrete tax items earlier than anticipated along with the excess tax benefit of share-based compensation. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of about 35% and a full year rate of just below 32%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was solid, increasing 10% to $819 million. Free cash flow conversion was 102% year-to-date and is in line with our expectations. We repurchased 2.4 million shares in the quarter, and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through September 30. At quarter's end, there were 208.8 million shares outstanding and 12.2 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization. Total debt as of September 30 increased due to acquisitions to $5.1 billion or 2.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We will continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet combined with excellent free cash flow to create meaningful value for our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales momentum picked up in the quarter, gaining nearly 40% sequentially and coming in at 106% of quota. Comparatively, sales were down 6% versus the record results in last year's third quarter but are still up 3% year-to-date. We enter our traditionally strongest sales quarter at 91% of quota and a domestic pipeline, without the benefit of any of our recent acquisitions, up 17% year-over-year. We are highly confident we will achieve our full year sales objectives. Integrated sales were $76 million in the quarter. Our traditional results were driven primarily by payments and digital solutions aided by growing contributions from our new billing and payments integrated sales focus. Our ability to deepen client relationships through add-on solutions remains an important component of our company's strategy. Operational effectiveness savings were $22 million in the quarter and are $62 million year-to-date. As Bob mentioned, we've eclipsed our full year goal of $60 million a quarter early on the strength of workforce optimization and procurement. We continuously focus on how to make our model more effective to ensure we have the capacity to invest in growth in service while expanding adjusted operating margin consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to see optimism in the banking market, with rate tailwinds and increasing attention on driving revenue growth. Acquisitions remain a focus in the industry as market participants look to rationalize costs in branch infrastructure. Digital remains the absolute priority with an eye towards providing high-value experiences across small business and commercial services. New payment solutions such as Zelle will continue to put heat and light on rising consumer expectations and pressure institutions to deliver services to that evolving standard. Over time, we believe institutions will continue to invest meaningfully in technology to meet the needs of a growing digitocracy. As I said at the top of the call, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2017 internal revenue growth guidance to 4%, which implies fourth quarter growth of at least 5% as a solid jumping off point for 2018. We raised the low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.02 and are now expecting a range of $5.05 to $5.12, reflecting growth of 14% to 16% for the year. We continue to expect that full year adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points. This underlying performance will be even stronger than the actual result when considering the impact of in-year acquisitions. And importantly, we expect free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 108% to 111% of adjusted net income. In conclusion, we've made important strategic progress this year both organically and through acquisition. We expect to meet our financial commitments leading to our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, expanded high-quality revenue and excellent free cash flow. Lastly, we were pleased to see an increase in our associate engagement scores for the fifth year in a row. Ensuring that our thousands of employees around the world remain committed to delivering excellence for the company and its clients is the critical element of our formula for long-term success. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Jeff, you called out a $16 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue. Could you break down the components of that between software and contract term fees? And then why the conviction that, that will improve significantly in Q4 and drive up organic revenue growth? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. The substantial majority of it was contract termination fees, a bit of license. And as you know well in this industry, we get -- we have a lot of visibility to termination fees in the -- on an institution-by-institution basis. It's a little bit more difficult to judge exactly when they're going to come in. We had thought that a number of them would come in already. And so we've got some reasonable conviction that they'll come in, in Q4, and if they don't come in, in Q4, they'll come in Q1. But we feel like where we are now that we'll see that come in. And license is always strong in Q4 because of the seasonality, and so we would expect that to pick up as well. David Togut : Got it. And then you highlighted some optimism in your remarks around bank IT [indiscernible]. Any read on what 2018 bank IT budget growth will look like among your customer base? Jeffery Yabuki : You broke up a bit. I think you were talking about optimism around technology spend overall in the bank space. David Togut : Correct and any outlook you have for 2018 bank IT budget growth. Jeffery Yabuki : So I'm not a great prognosticator about how banks will -- how their spend will be in the aggregate. But I do know, based on what we see and conversations with the market on a daily basis, that banks will continue to focus their energy on all things digital in terms of whether it's moving over to technologies such as Zelle. We're seeing a lot of demand for our Architect and Commercial Center solutions, and so that is a critical element of where spend is going. You also have a lot of focus in areas of risk, cyber and just ensuring that the back offices and the back-office infrastructure can keep up with the front-office demands of rising expectations. It's one of the reasons why, frankly, we see -- continue to see good growth in areas like DNA, Premier and other of our headline kind of star account processing platforms. So we have a lot of conviction overall that those areas will continue to pick up. And then lastly, of course, payments, so whether it's Zelle, we did our Dovetail acquisition in the quarter, really, because the world is moving to real-time money movement faster than we anticipated, say, a year -- a year or 2 ago, and so we see that to be an important part of our portfolio. So we're going to see more bulking up of spend there. Frankly, some of it will be offset by reductions in other areas, but we feel pretty fortunate about where our investments have been and where we'll ride that ride that -- sorry, where we will ride that wave of increasing spend. David Togut : Just a couple quick housekeeping questions. How much did the 3 acquisitions closed in Q3 contribute to revenue in Q3 and rest of year? Jeffery Yabuki : So it wouldn't be anything on the internal side, but Bob, I don't know if you can supply the... Robert Hau : Yes. David, the 3 of them closed throughout the quarter so not meaningful in the third quarter to speak of, one of them mid-August, the other beginning of September. So you saw a little bit but to Jeff's point, not included in our internal revenue growth metric. David Togut : Great. And then just end-of-period share count? Robert Hau : 208.8 million shares. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : So I guess, this question's a little granular, but the last 5 Q4s, the revenue's been up between $35 million and $48 million sequentially, so it's very tight actually in terms of how much it grows. It sounds like, on top of that normal rate, you're going to get maybe that $16 million back into Q4. Plus, the acquisitions maybe help by another $10 million sequentially. But just trying to bridge the gap, where is kind of the rest coming from? Is there going to be some just unnaturally strong seasonal movements in license? Or how do we get to that? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So it would be -- I mean, there's any number of factors. So one of them, obviously, will be the shifting of the periodic revenue as we talked about. We have some acquisitions that have gone from inorganic to organic such as Architect as we've talked about. We have just the aggregate impact of sales and implementations, DNA, Zelle, those kinds of things that are coming in. And then we have a lighter compare from the EMV, which will also anniversary at the end of Q4 in terms of the drag. And so that's going to lighten up meaningfully in Q4 as well. So we have all of those things, Dave, on top of the seasonality that you're talking about. So the seasonality is the Q3 to Q4 sequential, and most of the things that I'm talking about are more of a Q4-over-Q4 change. David Koning : Okay. Okay, got you. And then, I guess, the one other thing is just EBIT also has to be up like $50 million sequentially, $50 million, $60 million maybe even to get to your numbers, and that historically has been -- it kind of has moved around but kind of sometimes down a little, sometimes up a little but is a lot of what's coming on term fee certainly very high incremental margin. But is most of the stuff coming on pretty high incremental? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, to your point, we are going to have, based on what relative termination fee revenue was in last year's Q4 plus some of the periodic revenue that we expect -- or the majority of the periodic revenue, which we expect will come into Q4, again, that's going to come in at pretty high margins. So we are anticipating a very strong margin quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just on the EMV production, we get the comps are tough. But are you seeing normal reissuance activity? Has there been any change? Or is there any fatigue there? Just trying to understand because I think FIS had some muted growth there as well. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I -- Tien-tsin, I would say that we're seeing kind of normal reissue activity but for the fact that over the last, call it, 15 months, you had some banks decide or financial institutions decide to accelerate their reissue a bit to get onto the EMV bandwagon, and so this year, there's a little bit of sorting out going in there. But we're continuing to see institutions issue EMV. We also haven't had -- even with all the breach noise in the market, there has not been any big retail breach, which has driven, what I would call, unusual or off-cycle reissue or at least nothing meaningful. Tien- Tsin Huang : Right. So normal replenishment. Nothing like -- I know you mentioned breach for like Equifax breach, things like that. No sort of slowdown as a result, it sounds like. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. At this stage the institutions are still trying to figure out what to do about the Equifax problem. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, just like me. Trying to think. Okay. Just my follow-up and I'll jump off. Just thinking about Zelle. You mentioned it will be meaningful in '18. It sounds like there's a lot of activity pipeline backlog in terms of banks. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing? Is it really just going after some of the smaller banks and turning them on? Or are you actually engaging with the larger banks as well? You mentioned a bunch, I know, on the bigger side but just trying to understand a little bit better as we go into '18. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, sure, Tien-tsin. So I think what we said is we would see some measurable growth in '18, and we expect that growth to accelerate. That growth will accelerate for a fairly -- I think a fairly lengthy period of time. We had Wells talk about over 45% growth in the quarter. We had Bank of America talk about almost 70% growth in the quarter, PayPal another almost 50% growth in their product. So it feels like the U.S. is moving towards a kind of the early stages of a pretty important wave of P2P. Advertising launched just yesterday across Zelle, and I think they talked about a double-digit millions kind of initial campaign. So there is a lot of energy in there. We mentioned in our comments that we've signed officially so far 8 of the top 25 banks. We're having lots of other conversations. So we have over 2,000, nearly 2,500 institutions who use our Popmoney solution today. I suspect, over the next couple of years, most of them will move over. But in the nearer term, really, the substantial, substantial majority of larger institutions will move over to Zelle. And frankly, the benefit that we have is because of the position that we've staked out, I think many of them will either create their own solution or they'll come through us in the, call it, the top 50, top 100 institutions. So we feel pretty good about our position right now and that will allow us to grow faster early than we may have if we were just back in the days of standard linking into our account processing platforms. So we're feeling good about where we are today. Obviously, time will tell. But best we can sort out right now, it's -- the wave is starting, and we should be well positioned to ride it. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : On the back of that earlier question about the acquisition, can you talk a little bit about the go-forward expectations for those 3 acquisitions? Just want to get a better understanding of their size in terms of revenue and their potential impact in 2018. Jeffery Yabuki : So for right now we would expect the impact to be fairly muted since our current practice is not pick that up. We might get a -- under our current practice, I think we would only get 1/4 next year, so we wouldn't expect it to have much impact there. Monitise was a small public company in the U.K. Their revenue was public, so it's out there. It's not very large. PCLender was pretty small, and Dovetail was pretty small. So all of these are much more around adding to our solution set and being able to deliver them across our client base. So we see that the inherited -- what's the right way to say it, the inherited organic growth benefiting, but we're optimistic, by the time this starts to really layer in to our organic growth, that we will have the benefit, not only of the businesses that we acquired but frankly, the opportunity to continue to sell it across our base, which is what's been frankly our MO and where we have a lot of muscle over time. Jeffrey Cantwell : And then just on the back of that, if you could just take a step back and think high level. Could you just help explain to us how those acquisitions fit in the context of your overall strategy? I'm just thinking in terms of areas like international expansion, et cetera. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Monitise had both a U.S. -- kind of a smallish U.S. business and a smallish primarily EMEA-based business, both around digital banking. That's a very important priority for us, so we're looking to -- always looking for opportunities to create scale. But they also have a very, very unique technology called FINkit that we are using at the center of what we think is a kind of the next wave of where digital is moving to a microservices architecture, which allows much faster adding of feature, function and new capabilities, and we're also using it at the center of creating what we believe is the next-generation digital banking platform serving larger institutions around the world. So that's number one. Around Dovetail, Dovetail is a real-time-based payments platform, which is critical as the U.S. makes its move to real time. So the primary reason for buying that was to enable us to better serve U.S.-based financial institutions and frankly, as a very strong benefit is Dovetail serves some of the larger institutions globally, and they have a very strong business globally. They're ranked at the top of the world rankings around this payments capability, and so we're excited to have an opportunity to sell that to additional institutions both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And then lastly, PCLender, that is a digital mortgage origination technology as well as an in-branch or in-bank origination technology. Adding that capability into our digital banking platform again to enable our clients to have these best-in-class digital experiences was the rationale for that. And then Architect and Commercial Center that we acquired previously, again, that's about building out our digital services to enable banks to serve both retail as well as commercial and small business customers. So it all really fits in payments and digital. That's the majority of where our acquisition focus has been over the last several years, and if I had to guess, I would say it would continue. Operator : The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Damian Wille : This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. So I just wanted to ask about kind of the segment growth rates here. So we've seen some moderating segment growth rates more recently. First, is there any change in terms of long-term growth potential for Fiserv? And then secondly, kind of given the maturation in the industry, would you contemplate more transformative M&A that might be growth accretive? Robert Hau : Yes. Damian, it's Bob. On the Payments segment growth rate, there's really been a couple of key drivers. We talked a little bit about them in some of our opening comments. The EMV growth provided a nice lift last year. Q3 was the peak quarter of growth in 2016 so a very difficult compare. For 2017, we will anniversary that revenue growth drivers in the fourth quarter. But we also have talked about some of the larger programs that we won last year, a lot of the sales activities we had last year. And the timing of those implementations, because of the size of them and the complexity with our client base on getting those ramped up, is going to give us a lift into Q4 of this year and certainly into next year. And of course, we also see the benefit of things like Zelle continuing to mature. The advertising that was just launched yesterday will provide a nice lift into those transactions. It's very early into that growth opportunity. And so we see that lifting into 2018 and beyond. And we also talked about the digital insights relationship we expanded. So we see our Payments segment continuing to provide strong internal revenue growth lift relative to the overall company. It has in the past, and we'll continue to see that going out into the future. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would add a couple of things before we get to the acquisition question. I mean, I would say that we've had more jumpiness in our growth rates than we have seen this quarter so more movement and largely around the periodic revenue, right, having an odd quarter where we're $16 million down in periodic revenue. And one of the reasons -- we don't love that because it creates some dialogue like this, but we expect to have growth this year that is at or above last year's level. So we are targeting 4%, which is consistent with our guidance albeit at the low end, and we expect to see acceleration as we said in our comments today. So as much as the Payments segment is not quite as strong so far this year largely on the back of EMV, financial is actually up year-over-year. And so we think the diversity of our portfolio allows us to be able to combat the puts and takes of day-to-day business. Underlying all that, we're continuing to build out our recurring revenue, which is one of the reasons why we continue to build out margin. We're adding acquisitions that we think will enhance our growth rates as we go over time. We're already getting some contributions for some of the things we've done over the last couple of years. So we feel quite good about our portfolio. And then as we talked about in Investor Day, we've added a new corner to our model, and that's our integrated biller strategy, which is a brand-new initiative that we've just begun selling off of and delivering value to clients, will begin really in earnest next year. So we feel like the portfolio is in reasonable shape. And while there's been some ups and downs in our quarters this year, we do expect to have higher growth this year and higher growth again next year. So that is at least how I would think about the question on growth rates and the moderation. As it relates to -- Damian, on the transformative acquisition, the answer is we're always open to looking at what are the best ways to deploy capital. We use as our guiding principle how do we think we can deliver the most value for shareholders and the most value for clients. And if that happens to be an acquisition that is kind of labeled in air quotes as \"transformative\", then we'll do that. And otherwise, we'll continue to go down the path of -- I think our total payout ratio so far this year is about 120%, so we'll continue to focus on that as well as we've spent several hundred million dollars on acquisitions so using our balance sheet to make sure that we're  creating as much value for shareholders as we can. Operator : The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Maybe, Jeff, if we could start with the -- how to think about and square your sales results, which were up 21% last year in 2016 and then 3% year-to-date, with the comments around accelerating growth outlook. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on how that sales pipeline will kind of convert into revenue, how much from, for example, 2016 will convert to 2018 and 2017 to 2018 help -- to help us give us a sense of the level of confidence around that acceleration in revenue next year? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So we -- one of the compare challenges in Q3 is we had an unusually -- really an unusually large Q3 last year, and we would expect to not have -- or sorry, we did not have an unusually large Q3. This year, we had a very solid Q3, actually performed a little bit better than we anticipated. As you saw, we were 106%, but we do expect to actually have quite a strong Q4 based on what we see in the pipeline today. And some of those transactions, we believe, will have a little shorter implementation windows than we might typically see. Now on the other side of that coin, Jim, some of the larger transactions that we had last year in Q3 are still not live, and so that -- they will end up leading into '18. So from that perspective, there's a little bit of a mismatch, which is also feeding into our confidence that by the time we get into the second half of '18 next year that we'll have a little bit of a multiplied benefit of sales to revenue in our numbers. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then maybe can you also give us your update on kind of the strategic view as you see it? As you talk with your bank partners, the outlook for bank consolidation and M&A in the space clearly from a cyclical perspective, whenever you see rates go up dramatically, you tend to get a lot of M&As. So what do you see from the kind of the small-, medium-sized bank perspective at this point? Jeffery Yabuki : So I don't have a crystal ball, but I would say that M&A activity has been either fortunately or unfortunately strong for the last several years. We saw a little breather coming in as valuations popped up towards the kind of the last 3, 4 months of last year and into this year. We're now seeing people kind of get more comfortable with the valuation levels, and so we're seeing a little bit more activity there. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, to your point, with rates going up and the need to invest in digital and some of the back-office infrastructure, I think you're going to continue to see acquisitions go in at a fairly healthy clip. Operator : The next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro of BMO Capital Markets. Paulo Ribeiro : First question is on the margin. You mentioned that -- at least 50 basis points and you had some headwinds from the acquisitions. So could you help us get a sense of how much that headwind was and try to get more flavor around also how much of that expansion was due to cost save initiatives or just overall operating leverage? Second point is if you could remind us a little bit about the economics around Zelle, not pricing specifically but how you make money out of it. Is it similar to Popmoney? And yes, that's it. Robert Hau : Yes. Paulo, it's Bob, I'll answer the margin question. So first off, the margin impact for the second quarter from M&A, so the acquisitions that we completed in 2017 was about a 40 basis point headwind for the quarter and about a 20 basis point headwind on a year-to-date basis. We also talked about, in some of our prepared comments, the impact of the periodic revenue was certainly an impact to the third quarter. That comes back to us in the fourth quarter. And in Q3, that was an 80 basis point headwind so certainly suppressed the third quarter results. And of course, as that periodic revenue comes back into fourth quarter, that gives us the confidence that we'll achieve that greater than -- or at least 50 basis point margin expansion on a full year basis. That is really driven on the back of high-quality recurring revenue, continuing to provide growth throughout 2017 as well as the benefit of operational effectiveness. So through third quarter, we achieved already our full year outlook, our original full year guidance for the benefit of that operational effectiveness, and we'll continue to see some benefit into the fourth quarter. Mark Ernst : Yes. Paulo, as it relates to the economics of Zelle, it is much the same as Popmoney in that the longer-term economics are really built on transaction fees that we realize as the solution builds in the market. I would say, in the shorter-term this year and probably into the first half of next year, for sure, more of the revenues from that is coming to us in the form of professional services fees as we are helping our clients get ready for and kind of set up the capability to do this. So in the nearer term, it's really kind of a waiting -- it's a preparation game and then waiting for the transactional lifts that we think are going to happen with the network effects. Jeffery Yabuki : I think, Paulo, the other thing is, to Mark's point, we have services for the larger clients. Then, there's going to be a very significant wave of implementation -- an implementation wave of the smaller clients, and that will likely -- my guess is it'll take, unfortunately, a couple of years at least to get that done. And so there's going to be -- you're going to have conversion fees or you're going to have implementations going on for a long period of time while the actual transaction growth is ramping. Paulo Ribeiro : Perfect. Quick follow-up on Zelle. How does it -- would it work with the TCH, VocaLink solution? Because if I understand correctly, Zelle now primarily leverage the debit networks from Visa, MasterCard. And is it a competing offering when TCH -- because you guys are involved with that too, right? How should I think about Zelle versus the TCH solution? Mark Ernst : Yes. You really should think about it as Zelle is a real-time -- it's a real-time transaction. There are several ways of delivering on a real-time transaction today, the debit networks being one of those but only one of those. And in fact, I would suspect -- I don't know this for a fact, but I would suspect more of the transactions are not going through those rails. They're going through other kind of point-to-point rails that are -- that exist in the market between a number of the financial institutions. We are using the NOW Network as the kind of network that connects the various different endpoints that are going -- that we are installing. The beauty of the NOW Network is that it actually enables -- it's enabled to ride any number of different real-time rails that we can apply in different use cases or different situations depending on kind of what the most cost effective and delivery time urgent delivery is for a transaction. So in many ways, as The Clearing House capability comes online, it'll be another option in the sort of delivery of a transaction, but it'll just be another option. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Blake Anderson : This is Blake on for Brett. You noted at your Analyst Day and in this call as well your new combined biller internet banking and digital product, and it sounds like the interest is high. Can you tell us what you think the early client wins see in this product that is really different from existing products? And then is there sort of a killer app use case of this product? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Blake, if -- let me clarify. So the biller strategy, this integrated biller solution strategy is not about digital banking per se. It's about enabling billers through the different unique solutions we have, which range from acquiring biller payments to lighting up e-bill delivery within our RXP solution to doing print, to doing -- we talked about LoanComplete, which is enabling a lender to be able to use some of our back-office and risk products. There are some digital capabilities as well, e-bill, electronic statements, electronic communications. So it's integrating all of that together and basically creating a network for billers, which is, to some extent, distinctive from the digital banking or what we're doing from the bank -- in the bank space. Over time, we actually think, and to Mark's point around NOW, we think we'll be able to create a very interesting bank-to-biller and biller-to-bank payment exchange, payment network that will be very unique because of the position that we have. But that's a down-the-road strategy. The integrated biller solution strategy is a -- I think we talked about it at Investor Day being over -- we see it being over a $500 million annual revenue opportunity just cross selling the products that we have today -- or nearly $500 million, just cross selling the products that we have today with our existing client base so a very good opportunity. And what I said on the call, I gave an example of Freedom Mortgage, who acquired our LoanComplete solution, but we've had several other wins and lots of demand, which is increasing our conviction that this strategy has real legs. Unfortunately, that revenue won't begin to come on until '18, and frankly, the propensity of it will be after '18. But we're excited about the fact that we'll have another layer or another lever of growth that we haven't had historically. Blake Anderson : And then just my follow-up is are there clear integrations of your existing Fiserv products into the Dovetail payments hub in the near term? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, I mean, I would say it in a different way. There are a number of examples where Dovetail is already integrated into either our account processing products or into banks where we're running PEP+ and some of the other opportunities. One of the most intriguing and exciting opportunities is the thinking about what we've done in the PEP+ ACH network that we have and linking that with Dovetail to frankly create what we think could be a very exciting proprietary payments network, for lack of a better way to say it, but one that has not just the payment hub capabilities but some of the liquidity management solutions, risk solutions and linking that to our Commercial Center product, our cash management products, which today is being used by a number of the largest banks in the U.S. as well as into our account processing base. So again, we see a very nice synergy linking into the fact that banks are now turning a lot of attention to making sure they can provide real-time digitally integrated solutions to serve their most valuable customers, which are their commercial and wholesale customers. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, I wonder if you could just comment generally on the competitive environment, I'm thinking both in credit unions for the DNA product, where it seems like you're having some nice success. So wonder if there's a pricing call out there at all. And just generally, we're hearing about some of these sort of next-gen cloud-based solutions. Wonder how often you see them at -- in RFPs and whether they're sort of changing the competitive conversation at all. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. It's a great question. So we continue to have a lot of success with DNA amongst any number of other solutions, but for clients that are -- or prospects that would put themselves in the technology savvy, we want a modern platform with a lot of database optionality, DNA is a pretty good fit. We have a lot of momentum in the larger credit union space. There are some interesting dynamics going on in that space, and we feel fortunate that DNA is rising to the top there. And so that's fantastic news. And we're also seeing good success on the large bank side. As it relates to cloud, there is a fair amount of move to cloud in the digital banking space. We -- I think we might have mentioned last quarter that we've now moved Architect -- or engineered Architect, I was going to say architect Architect. We've engineered Architect to be able to run in the cloud, so it's cloud enabled. And so that's an important piece of optionality that institutions will want over time. And then there are -- there's a plethora of other, I'm going to call them, FinTechs that would lay claim to being cloud-based solutions, lots of noise and discussion there but very little real movement at this point. And over time, I really see us and others to be clearinghouses of that kind of capability so delivering it through Architect or through Corillian or through Retail Online or Virtual Branch or any of our digital solutions, Mobiliti, Mobiliti ASP and the like. So there will be here -- there will be, here and there, decisions made around that, but for the most part, we don't really see any move there or any move in kind of large cloud enablement. Now on the solution side, I guess, the last point of clarification I would make is that there is a continuing movement to cloud as a way to run infrastructure, period. And so we're quite happy about that because cloud, we think, is a more modernized way to talk about outsource, and that's been our business for a long time. And we're moving our own solutions to the cloud, and we see that to be good from a pricing perspective and an efficiency perspective and think that will be the way applications will run over the long haul. Operator : The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I wanted to start with -- Jeff's made this comment a few times with regards to the periodic revenues not being in the quarter. And I wanted to ask if -- when it comes to things like term fees, for example, I mean, you guys brought this up, FIs brought this up, is there something deeper going on in the background in the industry? You generate term fees when there's a milestone associated with contract termination. Are your bank clients pushing off terminations because they're looking at digital transformations, bigger solutions? What's going on in the background there? Jeffery Yabuki : No, Ashwin, there isn't. From our perspective, we're actually seeing contract terms get a bit longer as opposed to shorter, so we don't see that. And the -- for us, being down in termination fees in the quarter isn't for a lack of termination fees. It's for regulatory approvals take the time that they take, and there are -- there's complexity, right, to putting these transactions together. And so that's what takes the time -- I'm sorry, to getting them closed. So that's what's taking the time. It's not -- there's nothing under the covers going on there. And in fact, termination fees have grown over the last several years, and frankly, there's no indication that, that's not going to continue. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. No, I just thought I would check on that. The other question I had was with regards to Monitise, and you talked, obviously, on this call and in other forums about the strategic impact of it. When I look at the digital banking piece, is this -- I mean, if you get to a next-gen digital banking platform, you already have clearly an -- you have the partnership with NCR. Could you help sort of put all together? Are these targeted at different markets, different kinds of -- different types of clients or different-sized banks or what have you? What's the strategy with regards to having 3 solutions potentially in the market? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So it's a great question, Ashwin. The -- we -- Corillian is our kind of top of the market solution, which runs a number of institutions here in the U.S. and runs something as large as Westpac Bank in Australia. So it's quite a robust solution. It's primarily a solution that is targeted at the online banking space, not the mobile banking space, although it has the capability to deliver mobile, again, as we do in Westpac. What we're looking at doing is bringing our mobile capabilities and our Corillian capabilities together in a single platform using this microservices architecture, which will do 2 things. It will meaningfully lower TCO per client and fit into the space that I think about being between the kind of the top 10 in the market. So for the next -- and then -- and call it the everything below 100. So in that 50 to 90 institutions, which are trying to really fight with the largest players, we're looking at architecting a solution that gives them control and a very, very robust structure to bring sophisticated feature function to market when they want to. So they don't want an ASP solution, but they also, with all the pressure on efficiency ratio, they want a TCO that is more -- let's say, better fits their economic model. And so acquiring Monitise and bringing the FINkit capability, we saw that we had been looking at doing that and had already started doing that, but the FINkit technology is going to allow us to go meaningfully faster. We'll actually be in market in '18, and it will actually end up being a far more sophisticated, cloud-enabled technology. So we're very, very excited about that. And thanks, everyone, for talking to us this afternoon. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great afternoon and evening. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Please go ahead. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the sale of the majority interest of our lending solutions business, the impact from tax reform and the accounting changes in ASC 606. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter results were excellent across-the-board and contributed to us meeting each of our financial objectives for the year. Internal revenue growth in the quarter rebounded to its highest level in several years at 6%, with strong performance in both segments. Sales increased 14% sequentially and quota attainment was 100% for the quarter. The performance in the quarter led to a 22% increase in adjusted earnings per share, capping our 32nd consecutive year of double-digit growth. Nearly as impressive is that in 30 of the 32 years we have been a public company, our stock has provided a positive return to shareholders, further demonstrating the underlying growth and resilience of our business model. Our financial outlook for 2018 includes acceleration in internal revenue growth; substantial adjusted earnings per share growth, further buoyed by the tax reform passed last year; expanding adjusted operating margin; and strong free cash flow. Our 2018 guidance also incorporates some incremental investments we are choosing to make as a result of the tax law changes, which we will discuss later in this call. 2017 internal revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points, which includes margin dilution from in-year acquisitions and importantly, free cash flow crossed $1.2 billion for the first time. Earlier today, we announced the signing of an agreement to sell a majority share of our lending solutions business to Warburg Pincus LLC. This business has been primarily focused on auto loan origination, lease management and high-volume mortgage servicing. As you may recall, we formed a similar structure with our StoneRiver venture in 2008, which provided outstanding returns for our collective shareholders. We believe Warburg Pincus is the right partner to take advantage of the growth and value-creation opportunities in this business. A very important part of our strategic platform is ensuring we have the right mix of businesses to deliver superior value for both clients and shareholders. Over the last year, we divested a few smaller businesses and completed 4 acquisitions, all with an eye towards increasing differentiation, adding to our growth quotient and enhancing value creation. Now let's review our progress in 2017 against our key shareholder priorities, which were : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. A primary focus of our business is to continue to add high-quality revenue. Our internal revenue growth accelerated to 6% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across multiple business lines, including a rebound in periodic revenue from Q3. Internal revenue growth was on the lower end of our full year guidance at 4%. Adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points for 2017, and is our sixth consecutive year of expansion. Adjusted EPS finished near the top of our original guidance range, up 16% for the year to $5.12, and free cash flow was excellent, up 13%. We are pleased to have met our financial commitments for the year and are well-positioned going into 2018 and beyond. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships, with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. DNA, which we acquired in 2013, had another very strong year, with signings growing more than 30%. And within that, we nearly doubled the number of institutions signed with assets greater than $1 billion. We expect to see increased revenue from DNA in the related solutions in 2018 and to further penetrate the most attractive segments of the market. For example, we signed Sallie Mae Bank, a $21 billion asset institution in the quarter to implement a DNA-led digital bundle, including Architect and our leading payment solutions. The bank chose Fiserv and DNA because of its modern architecture, flexible user interface and superior digital capabilities. Architect, our multichannel digital platform acquired in 2016, has made strong inroads in a market that is increasingly looking for a flexible, integrated solution for both online and mobile banking that serves all types of users : retail, small business and commercial. Our platform, combined with market-leading payment solutions, has us very well-positioned to ride the evolving digital wave. As proof points, the number of Architect sales increased over 300% compared to 2016. We were pleased to expand our relationship with Fidelity Bank, with $4.5 billion in assets in the quarter. The bank selected Architect and CheckFree RXP to enhance its digital offering because of our robust features and depth of solution integration. We also signed Dollar Bank, with assets of over $8 billion to a digital bundle headlined by Architect, CheckFree RXP and our turnkey Zelle solution. We were again chosen to enable digital transformation due to superior technology and integration. We grew our Mobiliti ASP subscribers 24% to 6.8 million for the year. Mobiliti business also continued its growth trajectory as subscribers grew nearly 75% for the year and the number of live clients was up nearly 60%. In addition, subscribers on the Architect-integrated platform grew nearly 40% for the year. We expect strong growth as mobile continues its journey to become the preferred interaction channel for depository institutions and their customers. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. The Zelle P2P network launched in June with Fiserv as a key partner to enable both large and small financial institutions. During the quarter, we continued to sign larger institutions to our turnkey Zelle solution, including Comerica Bank, with $72 billion in assets. In addition, SunTrust, Citizens Bank and Ally Bank, each went live in the quarter, contributing to a 90% increase in sequential Zelle transactions. The market enthusiasm we are seeing with Zelle, along with a ramp in advertising across multiple media channels, is supporting our optimism about the size and the scope of our role in this emerging payments opportunity. We continue to expand our portfolio of innovative solutions during the year, completing 4 acquisitions in areas of strategic importance such as payments and digital enablement. Early in 2017, we closed on the acquisition of Online Banking Solutions with its award-winning digital banking product, Commercial Center. During the year, we signed more than 20 institutions to this high-end solution, nearly 4x the prior year and a sevenfold increase in total contract value. Commercial Center users increased 38% over the prior year and like Architect should grow substantially in 2018. We acquired Dovetail in the third quarter to provide our clients with market-leading transformational payments technology and real-time capabilities. We're off to a strong start, signing 2 of the top 25 banks in the quarter, Citizens Bank and KeyBanc, to the Dovetail real-time payment solution. We're seeing strong demand for these services in the U.S., which is adding to our forward optimism. And finally, for the fifth year in a row, we were named one of FORTUNE Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. We're also one of roughly 200 businesses to achieve this honor, along with being included in the Fortune 500. Now with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide additional detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 7% to $1.4 billion and increased 4% to $5.4 billion for the full year. Internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter was led by strong performance across both of our reporting segments, including the timing benefit of periodic revenue shortfall from Q3. Adjusted earnings per share grew a very strong 22% to $1.41 in the quarter and increased 16% for the year to $5.12. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 190 basis points to 34.0%, due primarily to strong Q4 revenue growth and mix. Our full year adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to a new full year high watermark of 32.8%. Our strong results were driven primarily by Payments segment growth, business mix and a continued focus on operational effectiveness, partially offset by a 30 basis point headwind from in-year acquisitions. We are well-positioned to continue expanding operating margin through high-quality revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits and growing our newer acquisition-based solutions. The Payments segment delivered internal revenue growth of 7% for the quarter and 5% for the year. Performance in the quarter was led by strong results from our card services and electronic payments businesses. Adjusted revenue, which includes the impact of our acquired businesses, grew 9% in the quarter to $792 million and 6% for the full year to $3 billion. Debit transaction growth for the year was in the mid-single digits and with only a minimal current year benefit from Zelle, P2P transactions grew more than 20%. Mobile banking continues to be a critical priority for our clients and a growth driver for us. In 2017, we signed 35 clients to Architect and 160 clients to Mobiliti ASP. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 6% sequentially and 24% for the year to 6.8 million. The Payments segment adjusted operating income increased 20% in the quarter to $288 million, and was up 10% to $1 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points in the quarter to 36.4%, due primarily to the timing of periodic revenue and growth in our scale revenue businesses. For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 35.1%, which more than offset the 40 basis point headwind from current-year acquisitions. The Financial segment adjusted revenue in the quarter was $668 million, with internal revenue growth of 5%, driven primarily by our account processing and lending businesses, along with an increase in periodic revenue. Internal revenue growth in the segment grew 3% for the year and adjusted segment revenue was $2.5 billion. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% in the quarter to $235 million and up 3% for the year to $849 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter improved 140 basis points to 35.1%, which was our strongest adjusted operating margin quarterly performance of the year. Full year adjusted operating margin for the segment was up 30 basis points to 33.5%. And margin performance for the quarter and the year was again driven by revenue growth in scale businesses, revenue mix and operational effectiveness. Corporate and Other net operating loss came in generally as expected for both the quarter and the full year, consistent with our comments in Q1 of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.8% and the full year was 31.2%. These results were slightly better than our expectations due to the timing of certain discrete tax benefits in the quarter. [indiscernible] on a GAAP basis, we recognized a $275 million tax benefit, driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impact on our deferred tax liabilities, which has been -- not been included in our adjusted EPS in the quarter or the year. As Jeff indicated, we expect a meaningful benefit from tax reform and accordingly, we currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 22% and 23%. This rate is down significantly from our previously expected long-term rate of 33% as well as 2017's adjusted effective tax rate of 31.2%. Our new adjusted effective tax rate range includes the expected benefit of the lower headlined federal rate, partially offset by reduced tax benefits such as the elimination of Section 199 deduction and a reduced value of state deductions. As mentioned upfront, we've decided to use this unique opportunity to increase our investments for the next couple of years, which we believe is the best option to maximize long-term shareholder value. We expect these investments to center primarily on client-facing technologies, with a focus on service excellence, digital experience and payments. And at the same time, we will also undertake a holistic view of our employee benefit plans. We expect the majority of these investments to subside over the next 18 to 24 months. Overall, we estimate that the tax reform savings, net of the new investments, will contribute between $0.55 and $0.63 to our adjusted earnings per share for the year. Our strong business model generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2017, up 13% from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion for the year was 111%, the top end of our guidance, once again demonstrating our focus on turning earnings into free cash flow. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million, and 9.7 million shares for the year. That translates to $1.2 billion for our shareholders in 2017 and $5 billion over the past 4 years. There were 207.6 million shares outstanding at year-end and 10.7 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding at the end of the year was $4.9 billion, or 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted leverage ratio. We'll continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, combined with excellent free cash flow to create meaningful value for our clients and shareholders. As Jeff mentioned, we signed an agreement to sell 55% of our lending solutions business, which we expect will be slightly dilutive in 2018. We anticipate receiving approximately $395 million of net after-tax proceeds and we will retain a 45% interest in the new venture. We anticipate closing the transaction in the first quarter and have incorporated the expected impact into our 2018 guidance. On a pro forma basis, the adjusted EPS for 2017 should be reduced by $0.16 to $4.96. We also expect this transaction to compress adjusted operating margin by about 50 basis points in 2018, which has been included in our outlook. We believe this transaction and subsequent joint venture is a superior way to maximize the value for our clients, associates and shareholders. We deployed approximately $385 million to acquisitions during the year, which we believe over time, will make important strategic and financial contributions. Along those lines, we've taken steps to streamline the Monitise acquisition, including the divestiture of the retail voucher business, which closed in January. This transaction alone reduces our net Monitise purchase price by roughly 70%. We've adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition in 2018. And given the nature of our business model, less than 5% of our revenue is impacted by the revenue recognition change. The primary areas of impact are termination fees and a subset of our professional services revenue. And while we do not expect the new standard to have a meaningful impact on our full year results, we do anticipate increased variability within the quarterly comparisons as the new revenue recognition standard is applied prospectively to our reported results. We've elected to use the modified retrospective transition approach, which will provide you with transparency on the impact of the old and new methodologies each quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales performance was 100% of quota in the quarter. For the year, sales were up 3% and at 93% of quota. Domestic sales results were slightly better, coming in at 96% of quota against aggressive 2017 targets. Total sales growth has averaged 12% per year for the last 2 years and keep in mind, we typically don't include the sales results from in-year acquisitions in our reporting. We anticipate a step up in sales for 2018, which is supported by a strong pipeline as we enter the new year. Integrated sales finished well, increasing 34% sequentially to $103 million in the quarter and up 2% to $297 million for the year. Digital channels, payments and statements continue to be the larger drivers of growth in this important element of our strategy. Our operational effectiveness results were outstanding, coming in at $82 million for the year, significantly exceeding our $60 million target. After the second year of our 5-year plan, we have achieved nearly 60% of the $250 million objective, well ahead of our anticipated pacing. Savings for the year were led by workforce optimization and procurement. Our data center consolidation has also progressed, closing nearly half of the locations we have targeted to eliminate. Our operational effectiveness target for 2018 is $50 million. We're seeing continued enthusiasm in the banking market due to a combination of tax reform and rising interest rates. We anticipate financial institutions will use this excess capacity to increase investments in their businesses with a technology focus on payments, cybersecurity, digital and data management and utilization. These priorities align quite well with our organic and acquisition-based innovation and we are well-positioned to benefit from this demand over time. With that, let's move to 2018. Our key shareholder priorities will remain substantially similar to the 3 focused areas tracked in 2017. Financially, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to accelerate to at least 4.5% for the year. Our revenue growth expectations for the year also assume a substantial reduction in termination fee revenue. Speaking of which, you will recall we had very high periodic revenue in last year's first quarter, which will lead to a difficult compare. Therefore, we expect internal revenue growth to be low in Q1 and that the expected acceleration will begin in the second quarter and build throughout the year. As we've discussed, we intend to allocate a portion of tax savings to increase our investments and maximize shareholder value over the longer term. Given the combination of these incremental investments, which we anticipate will moderate over the next couple of years, and the compression from the sale of the lending business, we expect our adjusted operating margin for the year to increase in a range of 10 to 30 basis points, and for illustration, have included a bridge on Page 19 of the accompanying slides. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.05 to $6.30 for the year, which is growth of 22% to 27% over the revised 2017 result of $4.96, reflecting the sale of the majority share of the lending business and the net earnings benefit of the tax law changes. Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion to be in a range of 106% to 111% for the full year. Given we are investing a portion of this year's tax benefit, we believe it is valuable to provide very early transparency into next year. For clarity, while this is absolutely not 2019 guidance, we believe our adjusted earnings per share growth should be well within our long-term outlook, be at least $7 per share and carry our typical level of free cash flow conversion. In conclusion, we view 2017 as a year of both progress and new opportunity. While we are pleased that we achieved our financial commitments, we are far more excited about the road ahead. We're proactively shaping our business to stay on the forefront of the trends facing financial technology and most important, to ensure we are the partner of choice for our clients. At our Investor Day in June, we shared a series of strategies that we believe will allow us to create sustained value for our shareholders and contribute to even stronger performance in 2018. We know our success is a result of the cumulative effort, dedication and accomplishment of our nearly 24,000 associates around the world who are Fiserv-proud and come to work each day to make a difference for our clients and shareholders. Lastly, we announced today that Mark Ernst, our Chief Operating Officer, intends to retire from Fiserv on April 1. Mark joined the company in early 2011 and has been a key part of the executive leadership team. Mark is a strong leader, with unparalleled strategic insights and vision. He has made numerous contributions to the company, including recently spearheading the development of a new end-to-end service model, which we believe will transform the way we serve clients. As some of you know, Mark and I have worked together on and off for the better part of 30 years. It's been a privilege to learn, work and partner with him in a journey to deliver differentiated value to our clients, associates and shareholders. We thank Mark for his many contributions to Fiserv and wish him the best as he moves into this next stage of his life. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : So I guess, first of all, deferred revenue was up a ton sequentially. It's been in a pretty tight range, kind of around $450 million for a while. Is that reflective of all the sales and part of the reason why like, that revenue's going to come in, in 2018? Robert Hau : Yes. Dave, it's Bob. You're absolutely correct. We did see an increase. That's part of our annual billing process and that revenue will materialize over the course of 2018. David Koning : Okay. Got you, great. And then I guess, one other thing, the minority interest line, are we going to see something like that now, the 45% is going to fall through there just like StoneRiver used to? And how much about would that be per quarter? Robert Hau : Yes. So you're exactly right. We will see the minority interest from the joint venture begin to flow through there in first quarter, very similar to what you saw with StoneRiver. We're not ready to forecast out that particular line of income statement but we will see that throughout 2018. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Dave, part of it depends on closing timing and things like that. So we'll give that a little bit more perspective in Q -- when we report Q1. David Koning : Got you. And the only other thing I had, just buyback thought process, like pretty typical going forward, like nothing's changing a lot with tax reform. We should kind of assume within guidance, kind of the normal pace? Robert Hau : Yes, absolutely. No change in our capital deployment approach, consistent with the last many years. Operator : And our next question is coming from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: Jeff, was there anything kind of -- any incremental visibility that helped you kind of get comfortable providing that preliminary view of '19, confidence in the pipeline? Or is that more just sort of a general confidence level about the ongoing solidity of the business? Jeffery Yabuki : So, it's really a combination. I would say it was for a couple of reasons. We -- as most people know, we operate in a pretty tight range in terms of earnings growth, and we feel good about some of the elements that we think are going to drive additional growth and therefore, profitability, as we deliver -- as we intend to deliver in '18 and then move into '19. But the other piece is we wanted to make sure that shareholders understood that some of the investments that we're making that we -- the incremental investments that we carved out of some of the tax benefits, we do see those investments -- we expect those investments to moderate over the next couple of years. And therefore, we'll have a more normalized growth rate even after having what's our guidance this year, the 22% to 27%. So we would still expect to be well within our guidance and we just wanted to make sure we gave a little pathway of visibility to that, again, on top of the fact that we do have an expected level of confidence that we'll see revenue growth start to step up in the way that we have strategically intended it to. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Are there other assets like the lending business that are ripe for similar treatment? Should we expect incremental divestitures to kind to free up some liquidity over the medium term? Jeffery Yabuki : It's a great question. I will say, as part of our strategic process, on a very regular basis, we're taking a look at what is the mix of businesses that we have, how do those businesses compare with not just the macros that we see today but the forward macros, does it fit well with this integrated -- we talked about this 4-corner strategy where we've got assets that fit into these corners and how do they fit in terms of driving innovation advantages and integration advantages. So we laid that out at Investor Day. And frankly, as the world evolves, there may be assets that fit today and won't fit tomorrow and assets that we need tomorrow that we'll acquire to make sure that we have the right mix. So as we sit here today, I wouldn't say we have an immediate list of things that we would look to divest, but we will continue to monitor that over time. I think we did the StoneRiver joint venture back in 2008, and this is really the -- we haven't done a larger divestiture since that time. So I don't know that necessarily, past performances is indicative of the future but it's not something that we plan to do on a regular basis. Operator : And our next question is coming from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Best of luck, Mark. Mark Ernst : Thanks, David. David Togut : As you look out to 2018, how are you thinking about the internal growth rates of Payments versus Financial? You've called out 30% growth in DNA signings in '17, so I'm curious if you start to benefit from those in '18, are those more 2019 revenue benefits? Jeffery Yabuki : So let me start with it and then, Bob, you can add on as needed. As we have for the last number of years, we would expect to see payments drive a higher proportion of relative growth in the company. And the signings that are coming -- the signings that we would have made in '17 would largely benefit second half '18 and into '19, again, depending on the timing of the transactions. But there's not -- we would be more benefited from the signings frankly in '16 in 2018 than we would the '17 signings. But we like the momentum a lot. You've, I'm sure, David, picked up the comment that we made about the number of institutions that we've signed, over $1 billion of assets. We're getting really great momentum there in both the bank and the credit union space and so, we're quite excited about the state of the market. David Togut : Are you seeing any relative difference in 2018 technology spending intentions between your credit union customer base and your bank customer base? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say relative to '17, no. We did -- we have been seeing the bank side of the charters step up their spending where the credit unions had been a little bit more out in front. We're also seeing a lot of interesting activity as it relates to payment hubs on the bank side, where the banks are putting more money into payment modernization, the credit unions have been historically, except for at the very high end of that base. So that's another slight differential. David Togut : Got it. And then operational effectiveness, you exceeded your '17 target by nearly 40%. It looks like your 2018 target of $50 million is actually about 16% to 17% below your '17 target. What are the reasons why that target would step down? And is that just a conservative view at this point? Jeffery Yabuki : David, we'll let Bob take that one. Go ahead, Bob. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff. So the simple answer is, as you know, it's a 5-year program. We just finished year 2. We are well ahead of the expected pace through the first 2 years. We're about $140 million in right now with the $50 million forecast for 2018. We'll be approaching $200 million just 3 years into the program. We had some really nice progress in labor optimization and procurement in 2017. Some of that doesn't naturally repeat. We'll continue to see benefits on procurement, data center optimization, real estate into 2018, and that's really the underpinnings of that $50 million forecast. Jeffery Yabuki : David, I would add in there, I mean, in all candor. We've meaningfully outperformed where we thought we would be in the first 2 years of the program. And so just continuing to make sure that we do this well and that we systemically continue to build up, it's also one of the reasons why we like our visibility going into '19. We would expect to see continued growth in the operational effectiveness. The other thing I would say is at our Investor Day, Bob had talked about the fact that he already was foreshadowing another phase. We're quite intrigued at some of the technological advancements that have been made, even in the 6 months or so since we did Investor Day in AI and RPA. And so we're evaluating those kinds of technologies in a way to both be more efficient but also deliver a far -- we think, far more effective service to clients. So it's a pretty interesting time in the whole space of operational effectiveness. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Congratulations, Mark, on your retirement. I guess, let me start with the 4 acquisitions that you made, I think, in the last just I think, 5 months, 6 months. Can you size them? So what's factored in the guide? And I realize the forward benefits are -- a lot of them are strategic and cross-selling type stuff in nature and microservices and all that. But can you size them and kind of lay them out for us, if you don't mind? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, let's see if we can get there, Ashwin. The acquisitions that we had been doing, we started the year doing the Online Banking Solutions, which was the acquisition of Commercial Center. We then did the PCLender acquisition. We then did Dovetail and then I think we closed out the year with Monitise or maybe it was the other way around, they were pretty close to each other. Each of those -- each of the Dovetail, PCLender and Online Banking Solutions or Commercial Center as we talked about in the script, those technologies are fully solution technologies. They're in the market, we're selling them, we're quite enthusiastic. But remember, the way we calculate internal revenue growth today, the growth that we would have gotten from those solutions, we don't bring in to our internal revenue growth calculation until it's been -- they've been with us for 12 months. And so, there was effectively 0 in 2017 from that. We'll get a little -- we'll start to get a little bit of it in '18 from the OBS, the Commercial Center acquisition. And then starting in the fourth quarter, we'll see little bits of the other acquisitions start to layer in. So we do have a fair amount of optimism around creating at least a tailwind for internal revenue growth as we move into '19 through these acquisitions. For the most part, we are buying businesses that we believe are importantly accretive to our growth rate, have technologies that we believe align very well with our clients and then third, that they fit our integrated value proposition that we look to bring to the market. So from a pure acquisition perspective, they will impact us on the top line very little in '18. There'll be some bottom-line benefit because, of course, that is not excluded in the calculations but that the real cumulative contribution will start in '19. Just like we saw with DNA when we bought that in '13, we're now seeing very healthy contributions to growth from that. Just illustratively, we would expect it to follow that type of a pacing. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. Anything on the size would also be helpful in terms of revenues. But the other question I had was the comment on term fees being lower, was that primarily -- did I understand it correctly, it's driven by ASC 606? Or is there some change in the market where you've kind of done something to have lower term fees, higher win rates, something like that going on? Can you comment on that? Robert Hau : Yes. Overall, there's -- as I mentioned in the opening comments, there's very modest, immaterial impact from ASC 606. Term fees are one of the areas but not a significant driver. It really is the market driving the reduced amount of term fees in '18 over '17. Jeffery Yabuki : Ashwin, part of it is you never -- you don't know exactly what's going to happen from term fees. We are expecting to see lower term fees, actually meaningfully lower term fees this year, and part of it is valuations. As valuations go up, we see acquisitions go down. We're optimistic based on what we see on the horizon that we'll win more in that space and therefore, term fees will be less. But it's just -- it's really the balanced assessment of the market and where we are right now. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. And if I could sneak one more in. Other than the 1Q comment that you had, Jeff, any other parts on guidance for segment revenue profits for the year? Anything we should watch out for as we lay out the quarters? Robert Hau : Not -- I mean, the comment Jeff made about Q1 is really driven -- if you recall, Q1 of '17, we came out of the gate very strong and so we have some difficult comps, and that was driven by some timing of periodic revenue that doesn't repeat. And then the other item I pointed out in my opening comments is we'll see some variability on a quarterly flow, given the ASC 606. But again, we'll give some good visibility into that as we release earnings on a quarterly basis going forward. Operator : And our next question is coming from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Paul Seamon : Operator, maybe we should go to the next question. Joseph Foresi : Can you hear me? There was a phone I think, ringing in the background there. Can you hear me now? Paul Seamon : We're all good. Joseph Foresi : Well, I guess my first question here is you made in your comments earlier, bank IT spending maybe was increasing due to maybe some tax reforms and I guess, higher interest rates. Do you think you're going to see maybe some more spending in '18? And if so, how would you think about that flowing through the model? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it's a good question, Joe. The comments were really meant to imply that financial institutions, the people making buying decisions are feeling healthier right now and that they're expanding the aperture -- opening the aperture on what it is they're looking at. For our purposes, we don't assume a spending environment that is, in any meaningful way, different in '18 than it was in '17. I think to the extent that we see the translation to wider exploration to sales to revenue, it's really going to be more of a '19 impact than it would be an '18. But we are optimistic about how \"banking\" feels right now and from their perspective and their opportunity to maybe spend more on solutions as they move forward. So that is a level of optimism that's more factored into out years than it would be this year. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then, could you talk a little bit about what the contribution from those digital offerings were in '17 and maybe what you expect them to contribute in '18? If you could size that in any way, that'd be great. Jeffery Yabuki : Joe, what kind of -- when you say contribution, what do you mean? Joseph Foresi : Either revenue growth or percentages of revenue. I know it's probably hard to peg, but I want to see if we can get a sense of how big they were. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. We don't supply that kind of detail. What I would say is one of the things -- one of the reasons why we've been using our Mobiliti ASP solution as an example, I think this year, we were up 24%, so the -- we're seeing a lot of growth on the digital side. That business has gone from really, 0 users about 5 years ago to now, nearly 7 million, and we would expect to see strong growth again. We're getting growth from Architect, now Commercial Center, Zelle, our Notifi product. So, there's a lot going on out there. So digital is becoming a larger and larger part of the company. Now I would say -- I think it's fair to say it's still a relatively small part of the company but its contribution is growing more and more, and we expect that to continue so long as the world continues to evolve digitally. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then the last one for me, do you expect to return to sort of this 50 to 70 basis points margin expansion in '19? I know you gave at least a goalpost out there of at least $7. So I'm just wondering, do we return to sort of the usual margin expansion in that particular year? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, absolutely. Barring something unforeseen that is not within our aperture right now, I would say we would expect to be back to where we are with our long-term guidance. Operator : And our next question is coming from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : One technical question and one sort of bigger picture. I'm trying to make sure I understand the puts and takes from the, I think, at midpoint, $6.18 guidance. I think I heard you guys say $0.55 to some other number in terms of net tax benefit, net of reinvestments. Could you just give us that number again? Robert Hau : It's $0.55 to $0.63. And again to your point, that is a tax benefit net of the reinvestment. Brett Huff : And then the other things we should think about that are impacting that, we should net that out of the guidance, to try and get kind of apples-to-apples to what we were all thinking. We need to add back $0.10 from the lending transaction, does that sound about right? I think you guys said 50 bps and the math I do is about $0.10 dilution from that. Is that fair? Robert Hau : So I guess, 2 data points. One, we indicated that the impact of the selling the majority interest is about a $0.16 impact to 2017. So we are essentially revising and modifying the $5.12 down by $0.16 to a new baseline of $4.96, and then growing the 22% to 27% EPS above that. Brett Huff : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then my bigger picture question is, you guys have done a remarkable job of buying assets that in many ways, were underperforming from other folks and putting them onto your platform and really accelerating sales. I mean, the numbers you guys gave were truly remarkable. I assume there's a lot more stuff out there that you guys see that you can kind of plug into your system. A, is that true? And then, b, where kind of would that be? Where are you looking to get that kind of -- that benefit? Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Brett, that's kind of you to say. We do see a lot of opportunity in the market in terms of using your vernacular, buying assets and plugging them into the system. We've done a -- I think we've done a nice job of building a distribution system and an integration methodology that allows that to happen. Because we've done that, we also recognize that there is a natural limitation that occurs across our distribution force in a -- we sometimes refer to it internally as shelf space. We can only do so many things in terms of asking our people to sell them but more importantly, of having the clients be willing to accept what it is we're selling in terms of their own capacity to implement. So therefore, we have to be pretty pragmatic about what it is we bring into the system, knowing that we have to manage those couple of variables and balance that against the products and solutions that we build on our own without going out and acquiring them. So we've really said, let's focus on the solutions that we think have the best macro characteristics, think payments and digital, and that it fits our brand and it fits the things that we're trying to do in terms of equipping our clients. And I would say also at Investor Day, we talked about payments, digital, account processing as both the distribution system and a place where you can add product like we added over PCLender and our Commercial Center product. And then the last bullet or the last component is in this biller solutions strategy, which we've identified, call it, I think more than $500 million of annual revenue opportunity that we just began to sell this year. We see that ecosystem as another way to do exactly what we've done in building the distribution system through the core account processing. So kind of a long-winded way of laying that out, but we do see those opportunities. Now, valuations aren't necessarily cooperating with us at this stage but again, we're willing to go out and buy those things that we think add value for clients and contribute to the growth in revenue and cash flow that we're trying to create within Fiserv. Operator : And our next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I just had a follow-up to Joe's question on the margin. You put an upper bound to your margin expansion, which I think is pretty unusual for Fiserv. So just trying to better understand, are we -- should we infer from that, that maybe you're more likely to reinvest any upside you might get on the margin side? I know you're talking about core operating margin being very strong, et cetera, but just trying to understand the guide a little better. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So Tien-tsin, it -- I think you're right. We typically don't put a 20 basis point range and in fact, we typically just say it's going to be a least a number and then we drive it. We've carved out frankly, about as much investment as we can take in this year, so it's not that. It really is a combination of the underlying dilution from the sale of the majority interest in lending, coupled with the substantial reduction in termination fee revenue, which obviously comes in at a higher margin. So we think those 2 are pressuring us. I think it's possible that we could be above that but we were trying to just give a likely range, really for modeling purposes more than anything else. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. No, that's fair, that's fair. It's good to get more parameters for us. We always need it. On the -- 2 quick ones, if you don't mind. Just on the periodic revenue benefit in the fourth quarter. Did you size that? I may have missed it. Robert Hau : We actually did not but order of magnitude, it was about $30 million year-over-year. And as you recall, we were light in the third quarter, about half of that is recovery from -- or rebound of that third quarter weakness coming into the fourth quarter. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. And then just last one, just I wanted to ask you, Jeff, on the -- I think there's been a couple articles about the ACCEL network and how you're going after more traditional signature debit business. I was curious sort of what your strategy is there. Could that be a growth driver as we think about Fiserv being a debit business? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it is. You, I assume, are referring to the Walmart lease. I mean, we have been doing a lot of work on ACCEL over the last several years, creating what we think is some interesting innovation. We've got a couple of other areas that we're working that we think will further differentiate our network and then obviously, benefit our clients along the way. So yes, I mean, we do see one of the drivers of growth acceleration in 2018 to be ACCEL network innovation. Operator : And our next question is coming from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I wanted to go back to your commentary, Jeff, on the outlook for bank consolidation and M&A. On one hand, typically when we have these kind of rate cycles is when more M&A happens. The increased SIFI limits would suggest that not that maybe your bank clients on the smaller end would be that directly exposed to it, but at the same time, you're talking about valuations up and term fees down. So maybe kind of give us your feelings on whether you think that even though we've had increased M&A recently, do you think that the numbers actually start to trend down at this stage? Jeffery Yabuki : So at least for our purposes, we are planning to have a fairly meaningful reduction in termination fee revenue. Termination fees, just as a reminder, termination fees are based on both the number of M&A transactions but the contract term remaining on the acquisitions at the time. The pulse that we're hearing from the market, and I would say this is more on the bank side of the house, is that valuations are high. The need to consolidate doesn't feel quite as compelling because the revenue line is growing. And I think you'll see people be -- see potential buyers be pickier than maybe they were 2 years ago, the number of targets is diminishing a bit. We're also starting on -- quite on the positive side, we're actually starting to see a slight hiccup -- sorry, a slight tick up in the de novo activity which we deem to be quite positive for the space. And so we're bullish about the space, more bullish right now than we've been in the last few years. We think that likely translates to this reduction in term fees and think we're better off planning for that than frankly, where we were over the last several years. James Schneider : That's helpful. And maybe just a quick question to follow-up on the sales commentary and how that translates to revenue. I think you had sales numbers back in 2016 which were up 20% or something like that, more muted in 2017. I just want to clarify, did the sales that you experienced in 2016, will those all be recognized by the end of 2018 in terms of revenue? And would you expect kind of like a significant pickup in Q2 and Q3 as a result of that? Jeffery Yabuki : So I think it would be way more aggressive than we could be to say all, but we would expect that the substantial majority of the sales that we made in '16 would begin to hit at some point in 2018. There's always exceptions to that but that -- we would expect that to be the case. As it relates to the sales in-year, I would say we have a practice of increasing our quotas each year. And so the fact that we were up 3% but we missed quota tells you that we actually increased our quotas. And frankly, what happened was there were a couple of larger deals that we've been working in our pipeline that took -- that had not closed in-year. We had originally expected that they would close in-year. It's not necessarily that they've gone away but they've just been delayed, and it's one of the reasons why we have some optimism for our 2018 sales performance being higher again than it was in '17. Operator : And our next question is coming from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Darrin Peller : I just want to get a question in on the reinvestment you talked about. Obviously, you gave us some indication that some of it was not going to be recurring after this year. But I guess, maybe just a little more granularity on the specifics of where you're reinvesting that money now in terms of what may or may not be repeated in 2019. And I guess, just given how much demand, it sounds like demand is growing around the banks in your end market, why wouldn't we expect that to keep going in that level in '19? Or is it just scale and operating leverage that overcomes that? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. No, that's a great question. So we -- as a matter of course, we have been investing in the company for a long time. And in fact, our investments in technology development have been going up, not down over the last several years. So for us, we didn't view this as, hey, there's all this capital, let's go invest it. We said this money belongs to the shareholders of Fiserv. What can we do to make sure that we are optimizing the returns or maximizing the returns over the long term? And so what we did is we looked at where are the areas in which we can make shorter-term investments. We believe that the majority of what it is that we have subsumed in -- or we plan to subsume in 2018 that we will give back over the next 24 months because the kinds of things that we're doing are geared towards increasing -- sorry, expediting time-to-market, expediting some projects that were in place. So the kinds of projects that we're thinking about are updates to our user -- some of our user experiences, doing more work and building out more digital experiences faster, making important enhancements to our service delivery platform, looking at how do we expedite payments platform innovation through -- primarily through integration advantage and looking at where are there fringe enhancements that we can make around, again, other aspects of our service model, where are there projects that maybe they were slated to be 3 years and we can bring them up to 2 years. So those kinds of things that we don't think require a meaningful commitment, and they'll be able to drive revenue and hopefully therefore, margins. The last carve-out in there is we are taking a look at our -- holistically, our benefit plans and our compensation programs to make sure that if there are things that we could do on the fringes or on the edges to make it more attractive, we know we're in the business of people and we need to have the right people delivering against these kinds of investments that we're talking about. And so we're just -- we're using that also to make sure that if there's something to do, that we do it. Darrin Peller : All right, that actually helps a lot. And just one quick follow-up. I mean look, it sounds like you're not in the market for a transformational type deal, obviously. And just based on the commentary we've heard, I mean, you don't seem like you think you need anything more than perhaps, a tuck in here and there. I just want to, a, make sure that's accurate. And then b, just kind -- and give us a little more thoughts from a strategic standpoint, Jeff, domestic versus international. It seems like we're in for domestic more so than international for a while. Unless I'm just looking at the demand environment here and extrapolating, but any thoughts? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So let me -- yes, absolutely. Let me take the easier one. I would say, we continue to be a primarily domestically-focused company. I would say that the Monitise acquisition and the Dovetail acquisition, those are products that we believe we will proliferate actually quite attractively around the world, so we're excited about that. But as it relates to deploying major capital, I would expect it to be more U.S.-centric than non-U.S.-centric. To the point on transformational acquisition, I don't sit here and say there's anything we need to do to add to our product set that anyone would deem to be transformational. I will say that we see a lot of interesting things on the horizon and the macro trends are evolving. And we will continue to take the actions that we think make the most sense for creating value for shareholders over the longer term. So far, I think we've not done a major transaction since 2007. And so we're quite comfortable with the path that we're on, but we also want to make sure that we're looking at the world correctly. Operator : And our next question is coming from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : I wanted to ask you a high-level one on Zelle. BNY Mellon's been in the news, talking about now using Zelle for business payments. Can you just remind us on your involvement with Zelle? In other words, are you partnering with the banks for P2P-only? Or is there the capability for you to partner with banks if they were, for example, here interested in using Zelle for B2B and not just P2P? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Great question, Jeff. We're partnering with the banks to help them -- help provide the offerings that are within the Zelle network. We've actually been in the market with our B2B disbursements and our B2C disbursements capability for a couple of years, it's part of the Popmoney suite. We would see that also meeting the needs of our turnkey Zelle service or other kinds of related offerings. So we believe that we will be part of the Zelle journey as the Zelle journey evolves. We've always believed that P2P was the first part of it and that we would be a very important enabler for banks that want to participate in the formation of this network. So we're quite excited about it, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. Jeffrey Cantwell : And then can you just maybe just remind us in terms of the margins on the Zelle transaction relative to sort of your kind of your core business and the trajectory over time? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So the -- this type of a Payments product is a fixed-cost business primarily and then a step fix as you build load over time. So we would expect the -- eventually as you get to scale, that the incremental margins on an electronic transaction will look like many of the other big, electronic scale payments businesses that we have, and then occasionally needing to build in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to support the clients in the real-time world that we're in. The caveat will be as Zelle -- the Zelle network adds more capabilities, I would expect us to be investing more than usual because there's more add-ons coming on. But overall, we would deem that to be a relatively attractive margin business like most of the payments businesses are. Operator : And our next question is coming from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Most of them have been asked and answered, just wanted to add 2 clarifications. I think full year acquired revenue was something about $49 million for the year. Just trying to think about modeling for fiscal year '18. Should we think about a similar amount of acquired revenue, call it $50 million for fiscal year '18? Robert Hau : You'll see an increase in the benefit of acquired revenue in 2018, primarily because 3 of the 4 acquisitions were in the August-September time frame. Only the OBS acquisition took place the very beginning of the year. Jeffery Yabuki : I would guess it will be up a bit. It'll be up a bit, Bryan. Bryan Keane : Okay. Yes, we can just model it up, I don't know. We can model a little bit of growth. It's just hard to size it, given we don't know the exact size of all the acquisitions. Just turning to sales on the sales side, I think you guys obviously talked about the sales growth obviously being strong in '16 and then a little bit lower in '17. Is there a growth rate you have in mind for it to accelerate in '18, Jeff, in order to keep the kind of the internal revenue growth accelerating into fiscal year '19? Jeffery Yabuki : So I would say that the interesting thing is most of what we sell -- as you know, Bryan, most of what we sell in '18 will probably have a bigger impact on '20 because of implementation cycles and things like that. It'll either be recognized in-year or it'll actually likely be out towards the second half of '19 and into '20. So a lot of what we need for this year is kind of in the bag in terms of the things that we have sold. So we -- but we would be always looking because we're geared on creating sustainable kind of moderate increases in internal revenue growth each year, we do need sales to go up. And ideally, if we're going up in the 7% to 15% level, that's pretty good performance. Operator : And our next question is coming from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, question for you just on mobile banking and Internet banking. It seems as though more banks are looking to put that on a single platform and I believe you have a product that's similar that would meet that demand. And I'm wondering, how much of the growth you're seeing is the result of banks and credit unions wanting to go that route and maybe how that benefits -- if that's accurate, how that benefits Fiserv? Jeffery Yabuki : So Kartik, we do have a platform called Architect that is a single platform for all of the digital experiences online, tablet and mobile. And it's able to also serve retail, small business and smaller commercial customers. So that platform does meet that need. I would say that there is a growing segment of the market that wants that kind of platform, less because it's a single platform and more because this platform has tools that allow you to have a little bit more control in-house, and some of the more progressive banks are wanting to control more of the experience. So we are seeing that. I would say that it's a fairly small segment of the market. And while we're winning because of the size of our base, in and of itself, that segment is not gigantic. I think it'll grow over the next decade, which is why we thought this was an important acquisition for us to do in '16, and it is contributing. Make no mistake, digital capabilities are very important growth drivers for the company, but that segment is still a relatively small segment. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, we've seen some bank consolidation and obviously, term fees maybe not in 2018 but in 2017, did contribute. Are you seeing any movement by the banks wanting to change contract terms or maybe term fees are capped or there is some kind of a change for that than we've seen previously? Just any contract term changes that banks might be looking for. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Kartik, I don't -- listen, I think in any sales contract negotiation, the parties are going to try to get what they want. I would say, it's a pretty normal part of the business. So we haven't seen tremendous pressure there. I think in some cases -- I mean, since I -- at least since I've been here, there are often caps in the term fees in terms of the percentages, what is the percentage and how many years. You can see that but I would say that there's not been any major change in the negotiated terms or the more expected terms in the market. Operator : And our next question is coming from Jennifer Dugan of SunTrust. Jennifer Dugan : This is Jenny Dugan on for Andrew Jeffrey. I was wondering if you could parse out some of the margin growth, just given the different moving parts, kind of parse it out by segment. Robert Hau : You're looking for 2018? Jennifer Dugan : Yes. Robert Hau : We don't provide the growth. Overall, the growth guidance that we gave was the 10 to 30 basis points. We don't typically provide detail of that by segment. Our Payments segment traditionally is a higher margin business, and we certainly would expect that to continue. But I would anticipate both segments providing margin left into 2018. The reduction in term fees is typically more prevalent in the Financial segment, and so that puts some additional pressure in Financial versus Payments. But overall, we see progress outside of that in both segments. Jennifer Dugan : Okay, great. And then when you were talking about the operational effectiveness, were you saying 15 or 50 for this year? Robert Hau : 50, 5-0. Jennifer Dugan : 5-0. Okay. And then lastly, can you give us any sense of the revenue associated with the lending business that's being sold? Robert Hau : Revenue for lending? That is -- we have essentially treated that as a... Jeffery Yabuki : I think Jenny was looking for -- sorry. Jenny, you were looking for the sizing of the revenue for modeling purposes? Jennifer Dugan : Yes, exactly. Robert Hau : Yes. It's well less than 5% of the revenue of the company. Jeffery Yabuki : Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon and now, evening. We appreciate the support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call our Investor Relations group. Have a good evening. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the impact from tax reform and the accounting changes in ASC 606. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. All of the share and per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and our comments are adjusted for our 2-for-1 stock split completed on March 19, and also the 2017 full year adjusted EPS has been revised for the impact of the completion of the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our start to the year, achieving solid financial results for the quarter slightly above our internal plan, strong adjusted EPS and an increase in our client advocacy and experience measures. We are on track to achieve our strategic and financial commitments for the year. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter even on lower periodic revenue. Adjusted operating margin was flat and adjusted earnings per share was up a strong 23%. Market momentum continued, kicking off 2018 with sales up 12% versus the prior year. We also received approximately $470 million of proceeds from 2 business sales closing in the quarter : the 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and a retail voucher business acquired with Monitise. We expect to deploy this capital consistent with our longstanding allocation methodology. Two weeks ago, we held our annual client conference, Fiserv Forum. With more than 4,400 in attendance this year, Forum is the place where financial executives explore the latest technology trends, experience our leading-edge solutions and connect across hundreds of unique educational and networking sessions. We also hosted a record 270 prospect attendees during Forum, which reinforces the momentum we are experiencing across our portfolio of innovative solutions. We continue to advance the 4 corners of differentiation growth strategies shared at last year's Investor Day. Each corner, account processing, digital, payments and biller solutions, has meaningful vertical and horizontal growth opportunities, which we believe will lead to deeper client relationships, increased high-quality revenue and even stronger free cash flow. Earlier this year, we provided our key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We provided accelerated internal growth rate guidance this year, which assumed growth would generally increase throughout the year. Consistent with that guidance, we believe the 3% internal revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark for the year. Internal revenue growth, led by 5% growth in the Payments segment, was pressured by the expected reduction in periodic revenue across both segments versus the comparable quarter. Adjusted operating margin of 32.5% was flat in the quarter. This result included approximately 160 basis points of margin pressure from the combination of lower periodic revenue, 2017 acquisitions and the divested Lending business. Adjusted earnings per share was up 23%, which includes the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to add new clients across our market-leading processing -- account processing solutions. Our DNA platform had a great start, signing 7 new clients in the quarter. We also expect nearly 30 clients to go live this year, which is a significant increase in the number of implementations. And of that, more than half the institutions have assets greater than $1 billion. We also continue to have success with our Premier platform, which has the largest client base in the market. We are pleased to renew and extend our Premier relationship with UnitedHealthcare's Optum bank, the country's largest provider of HSA accounts. We also signed Two River Community bank with assets over $1 billion in a competitive takeaway that, in addition to account processing, included a full digital and payment suite with solutions such as Mobiliti, CheckFree RXP and Notifi. We continue to progress our new integrated biller strategy, which includes enabling some of the largest billers in the country with our payment solutions. During the quarter, we signed WellCare Health Plans, a provider of government-sponsored managed care services with over 4 million members, to a bundle of omnichannel payments products headlined by our BillMatrix solution. We renewed our walk-in bill payment partnership with Walmart, which allows their customers to pay bills at thousands of Walmart locations across the country. Digital continues to transform from technology to a mindset. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 25% in the quarter and 7% sequentially to more than 7 million. Mobiliti business users expanded over 50% as commercial capabilities also continue to move up the digital value chain. Given the size of our client base and early stages of adoption, we continue to anticipate strong subscriber and transaction growth across our digital suite for the foreseeable future. We've launched a number of solutions such as CardValet and SecureNow, which create differentiated customer value at the intersection of payments and digital experience. These solutions leverage our digital rails and enhance our long-term recurring revenue. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We, along with the financial industry, continue to focus on Zelle, which is driving new clients and strong transaction growth. Zelle transactions increased more than 80% sequentially in the quarter. We signed 2 top-35 banks to our turnkey Zelle solution : Synchrony Financial with assets of over $95 billion and Zions Bancorporation with assets of over $66 billion. Including these 2 signings, we're contracted to provide Zelle to 10 of the top 35 banks and still have headroom to meaningfully expand the size of our network. We're pleased to announce that Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the world with over $90 billion in assets, has also selected our turnkey Zelle solution. So far, including Navy Federal, we've signed 3 of the 5 largest credit unions in the country as full Zelle clients. Overall, we believe Zelle is more than a solution. It is a strong statement that financial institutions will continue to own money movement. We're excited to play a key role in this fundamental-enabling capability. Our newest enterprise payment solution, Dovetail, continues to generate significant interest as financial institutions look to modernize the payments infrastructure. On the strength of Dovetail, Fiserv was recently recognized by Aite Group as having moved into a market-leading position in payments hub technology. Estimates are that about half of the top 100 U.S. institutions have selected a solution which leaves significant runway for growth both in the U.S. and around the world. Commercial Center, our sophisticated digital commercial cash management solution acquired last year, anniversaried in the quarter. Since owning the business, we've added 29 new clients, nearly 5x the clients that were sold in the prior year. As important, the Commercial Center pipeline remains multiples above where it was when we closed the acquisition. In Australia, the new payments platform, or NPP for short, was launched in February. Fiserv, SWIFT and Australian financial institutions collaboratively designed the addressing service, including pay ID. NPP is a real transformation for Australian consumers, corporates and government agencies, providing them the ability to conveniently send and receive real-time payments 24/7 nationwide. Finally, we were recognized as the most creative application of voice technology at the PYMNTS.com Alexa awards in April. Our solution turns everyday banking tasks, such as balance inquiry, into a voice conversation with Alexa. Designed with advanced AI capabilities, our solution makes banking easier for consumers with features such as bill payment reminders. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, this quarter, we adopted ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard, using the modified retrospective transition approach and accordingly did not restate our prior period financial statements. In each 10-Q for 2018, we will include additional disclosure related to the impact of the new standard on our financial statements. As shared previously, we do not believe the cumulative full year impact of these changes will be material to our financial results. However, we do expect a bit more quarterly variation during this year than we've seen in the past for some of the revenue lines. For comparative purposes, had we elected to restate the prior year periods under the new standard instead of using the retrospective approach, our internal revenue growth rate for the quarter would have been 4%. Adjusted revenue was $1.4 billion, up 4% in the quarter and internal revenue growth was 3%. Solid execution drove our internal revenue growth for the first quarter, even with periodic revenue down $9 million on an expected difficult quarterly comparison. As Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect internal revenue growth to accelerate during the year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 23% to $0.76. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year due to the combined impact of 160 basis points from lower margin related to 2017 acquisitions, a decline in periodic revenue and lower performance from our now-divested Lending business. Payments segment internal revenue growth was 5% while adjusted revenue grew 7% to $770 million. Performance in the quarter was led by strong results from our card services and biller solutions businesses. Debit transaction growth in the quarter was in the mid-single digits, and P2P transactions grew more than 20% year-over-year. We had over 80% sequential quarterly growth in Zelle transactions and believe that rapid growth will continue as more clients and consumers adopt Zelle. Mobile banking continues to perform very well as Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 7% sequentially and 25% year-over-year to 7.2 million. Architect, our market-leading digital platform serving retail and small business customers, continues to grow as nearly 40 clients are slated to go live this year. Our Payments segment adjusted operating income was up 5% to $272 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 35.4% due primarily to the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which compressed the segment margin by 110 basis points. Financial segment adjusted revenue of $616 million was down slightly for the quarter. This was due primarily to the divestiture of the Australian item processing business last year and lower growth in our Lending business, which was divested late in the quarter. Internal revenue growth in the segment was 1%, led by our account and item processing businesses, offset by a decline in periodic revenue. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% to $202 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 120 basis points to 32.8% due to continued focus on operational effectiveness and higher-quality revenue drop-through despite lower periodic revenue in the segment. Corporate adjusted operating loss was up 11% in the quarter, and this increase was due to an unplanned litigation expense outside the U.S. We expect the full year corporate segment loss to be up slightly versus 2017. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, largely due to the federal income tax rate reduction and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. As with last year, we anticipate the excess benefit to be front-loaded due to the timing of option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units. We continue to expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. Free cash flow in the quarter was $316 million, down slightly from last year's due to revenue -- excuse me, due to timing of working capital. Free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 98%, which we expect to improve throughout the remainder of the year. As Jeff mentioned, free cash flow does not include the nearly $470 million of proceeds received from the business divestitures in the quarter. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion or 2.1x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. The decline in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio from the year-end level is due primarily to the receipt of the Lending Transaction proceeds late in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we intend to deploy these proceeds consistent with our longstanding capital allocation methodology. And along those lines, we returned $398 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of 5.7 million shares. As of March 31, there were 411 million shares outstanding and 15.8 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Even after a strong Q4, sales were up 12% in the quarter and sales quota attainment was 92%, our strongest first quarter attainment since 2014. Sales performance was led by a number of solution areas, including digital, biller and commercial services. The domestic pipeline remains very healthy, up 20% at quarter's end and positions us for a strong sales year. Integrated sales were also excellent, increasing 19% to $61 million in the quarter. We're off to a very good start in year 3 of our 5-year operational effectiveness program, achieving $18 million of savings in the quarter, with strong labor optimization and procurement benefits. We expect to achieve our $50 million objective for the year and have begun preliminary planning for the coming Phase 4, which we believe will show significant opportunity. We continue to sense optimism in the overall financial market on the strength of rising rates, benign loan losses and hopefulness around the regulatory environment. As digital is accepted as an idea that is here to stay, an increasing number of institutions are exploring ways to use the platform as a more proactive growth lever than we've seen before. Given the current environmental backdrop, we would expect to see technology spend continue to increase as institutions look for ways to update their back office, bring enhanced capabilities to customers and, equally important, invest in risk, fraud and cybersecurity to further ensure safety and security in an ever-complex financial system. Lastly, around the environment. The number and depth of conversations around payments modernization continues to be significant. I'm quite bullish that this trend will lead to more opportunities, including the delivery of new solutions to address the emerging real-time payments ecosystem over the mid to long term. As I stated upfront, we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year. We continue to expect the step-up of internal revenue growth to at least 4.5% with rate acceleration throughout the year. We now expect adjusted EPS for the year to bias above the midpoint of the split-adjusted range of $3.02 to $3.15, which is growth of 22% to 27% over the $2.48 in 2017. We continue to anticipate that full year adjusted operating margin will expand between 10 and 30 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be in the range of 106% to 111% for the full year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year, making progress on our financial, operational and strategic objectives. We're well positioned to achieve our financial goals while investing to drive client and shareholder value for the short, mid and long term. Most important, I thank each of our 24,000 associates around the world who regularly go above and beyond to deliver Fiserv to our clients each day. You are the collective catalyst that makes us our very best. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Jeff, could you comment on just the pace of conversions in the DNA product over the balance of the year? You've had some very strong signings both last year and the year before. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, it will bias, I would think, primarily to the second half of the year. We have a number of institutions starting to go live and then the momentum will continue through December. And given the good start to the year, 7 signings in Q1, we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that we'll carry into '19 as well. David Togut : Understood. And then on the operational effectiveness target, it looks like you're well ahead of plan for this year, at least if we annualize the $18 million that you showed in Q1. Is there any reason why that annualized rate of savings should be different from what we saw in Q1? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. There will be some variability in that. It's not -- it doesn't start at $18 million and necessarily move up. But I would say that we feel quite good about achieving our $50 million given the $18 million this quarter. And as I mentioned, we're starting to ramp our work up a little bit around Phase 4 given where we are already in this existing phase. So we're feeling good about that. David Togut : Understood. And then you announced a big hire recently to run your card services business, Kim Crawford Goodwin, does that signal -- or Goodman. Does that signal a change in your ambitions for card services intending to do anything bigger in that business? Jeffery Yabuki : So we're very happy to have Kim onboard. She's a strong, experienced payments leader. We ended up having an opening in that business, and that business is a very important business to us. We're going to continue to make that as robust and as strong as we can. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of interesting solutions emerging in the real-time -- in the world of real-time money movement, and we think she's kind of the right leader at the right time to help us deliver that. David Togut : Got it. Quick final question. The $9 million year-over-year decline in periodic revenue, what was the breakdown there between a decline in contract term fees versus a decline in software revenue? Robert Hau : The majority of the decline is actually driven by licenses in the quarter. As we said in our comments 90 days ago, when we gave original guidance, we actually anticipate term fees to be down meaningfully on a full year basis. But you'll recall, we had very strong term fees in the fourth quarter of last year, and that's where we'll see that decline more prevalent. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : So I guess, first of all, just sequentially, there's a couple of things in Q2 I'm wondering about. First is in the FI segment, how much sequentially should that be down given -- I think you said it was late in the quarter that the lending business went away, probably running at like $50 million a quarter. I think the disclosure was somewhere around that. So should that be down like $40 million sequentially? Robert Hau : Yes. On an adjusted revenue basis, that's correct. So that will be out of our revenue on an adjusted and a GAAP basis, essentially, March 29, I think, was the closing date forward. So it was in there for the full first quarter. It will be out the balance of the year. In order of magnitude, your number's about right. David Koning : Okay, cool. And then secondly, I remember last Q2 in the Payments segment, you had a $15 million kind of one-off headwind. Does that create a really easy comp for margins, so payment margins could be up 100, 200 basis points or something, just this quarter? Robert Hau : So you are correct, you're remembering correctly. We did have a $15 million charge in second quarter of last year, and we certainly do not see that repeating in '18. So that will provide a benefit. Jeffery Yabuki : Dave, I would say that the only potential offset is, as we mentioned when we gave guidance last year, that we were going to be spending money making investments and there will be some ramping of those investments. But I would certainly agree with Bob that we wouldn't expect to have anything like that recurring in Q2. Operator : Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal at Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal: You mentioned Q1 is the low watermark in terms of overall growth. Can you just speak to -- and this question dovetails a little bit with some of the others that you've already answered. But can you just speak to sort of cadence we should expect for the remaining 3 quarters? Is it a gradual increase quarter-over-quarter? Is there a little bit of steeper acceleration later in the year? And then also just if you could cover off on the drivers of deceleration in the Financial segment revenues in Q1, which you went through, and I may have missed them. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I'll take the first part and I'll let Bob take the second part and then I'll let Bob correct the first part. But the -- we -- when we gave guidance for the year, we indicated that we would have -- we expected Q1 to be weak. We had a whole bunch of periodic revenue last year in Q1, and so we knew that was going to make the comparable a little bit more difficult. And then if you look at the growth rates last year in Q1, 2 and 3, I think that's a good way to think about how our acceleration will happen somewhat inverse to that because Q2 was where it was and then Q3 was down lower and then Q4 was quite strong. So if you think about our revenue, if you look at our processing revenue, we're quite happy with how we're building our high-quality recurring revenue. We continue to believe that will step up throughout the year and then that -- and that will layer in against the comparables. But then we also have significant implementations going on with Architect, DNA, Biller, Zelle, those kinds of programs on top of everything else that we have going on a regular basis, which we'll be adding in. We would expect to see some recovery in periodic revenue as well over the next couple of quarters as we get back to a more normative level from where we started in the year. Bob? Robert Hau : And then your question around the Financial segments. We saw the Financial segment for the quarter up 1% on internal rate of growth. We saw some good growth in our account and item processing businesses, but we did see the periodic revenue decline that I talked about overall for the company of about $9 million. The majority of that manifests itself in the Financial segment. So that helped -- that mitigated some of the benefit for the growth we got from account and item processing. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it, okay. And then one more for me. On balance sheet deployment and capital deployment strategy here, it feels like the valuations in fintech are pretty stretched. Your free cash flow conversion has always been excellent. And with the lower tax rate, it's even better. Is now a better time to contemplate potentially rolling in a dividend? Is that something that could be in your long-term thinking? Or are you still sort of saving your dry powder for when you may need it for some other uses of capital? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Ramsey, I would say we're pretty disciplined about our capital allocation strategy, how we think about it in terms of biasing to share repurchase, acquisitions and then debt repayment. And -- but we also, kind of on an umbrella basis, look each year on should we pay a dividend or how should we think about that. And so we do that and we will do it again this year, of course. I think for now, we feel like our strategy makes the most sense. We are pretty disciplined about how we think about intrinsic value vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis our allocation to share repurchase. And obviously, with the recent tax law change and how to think about NPV, right, that had a very significant impact on how we would consider intrinsic value. But again, what we're focused on is delivering value to shareholders. And on a year-in and year-out basis, we'll continue to try to determine what's the right formula for optimizing or maximizing that value for them. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : It's something you've touched on, but I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in Europe so far this year in terms of the regulatory environment, just in terms of how it's been evolving and whether there's any specific opportunities that you're seeing. You seem to be calling out a strong pipeline, so I'm just curious whether, net-net, you stand to benefit from Europe's regulatory changes around payments. And specifically, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the shift to faster payments and what you're seeing over there and whether it's a trend you can capitalize on. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So just, Jeff, it's a great question and it's always interesting to watch what's going on in other parts of the world and trying to extrapolate how that might impact us here. The areas that we're the most focused on in Europe right now would be the idea of open banking and what are the implications. One of the opportunities that we have is that we bought Monitise last year and acquired the FINkit technology, which is a really fabulous tool for purposes of helping financial institutions enable their APIs to be open banking ready. And so we're making progress there. We're excited about that and the opportunities. I expect us to have some announcements over the next couple of quarters on selling that capability and for open banking purposes. And the other area in which we're very, very focused is on payment hub technology, as we mentioned. And Dovetail -- the business Dovetail as opposed to the product Dovetail, the business Dovetail had a very nice presence outside the U.S., and we're using that to leverage in Europe as well as Asia and LatAm to see how we can further extend the reach of Dovetail. So we're certainly focused there. On faster payments in Europe, we don't have specific payment capability -- kind of front-facing payment capability as we do here, but we are very interested and watching what's going on in the agent bank space. Basically, as I'm sure you know, in Europe and in the U.K. specifically, you have to have basically -- financial institutions have to use another agent to move money around. And it looks like regulatorily that might open up, and I think that will create some interesting opportunities for us as we move forward. Jeffrey Cantwell : Great. I appreciate that. And then I appreciated the update in terms of what you're seeing from Zelle in the quarter. I just want to make I understand your comments. And were you saying that -- is Zelle revenue starting to layer in, in a meaningful way? And can you talk about whether perhaps there is any change in terms of how you're thinking about Zelle as a revenue source for you over the course of this year? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we're expecting Zelle to contribute to revenue. It's part of why our internal revenue growth is going to go up at least 80 basis points year-over-year. Zelle is a piece of that. Now there are a number of pieces in there. But Zelle -- we like what we're seeing in Zelle both in terms of new signings, but the sequential growth in transactions is significant. And we're a bit constrained right now in our ability to get clients live. The network itself is experiencing some growing pains, but we are very, very bullish on Zelle. And really, in terms of both the P2P opportunity, but the other payments opportunities that will be resident within the network itself. So we'll be talking about Zelle for a while. I think it will also be a while before we're calling it out as being as big as we'd like it to be, but we are quite enthusiastic and are seeing measurable results in 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: I was hoping you could just give a quick update on the competitive landscape, both with respect to kind of traditional and maybe some of the newer players whether it's Q2 or Temenos? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. It is -- the competitive question is always interesting because we have some common competitors in certain spaces and very distinctive competitors in other spaces, whether it's a Q2 or Temenos or the more traditional competitors. I would say on balance, as opposed to talking about specific competitors, I would talk about the landscape on balance is -- there is more spend available today than there was a year ago. There is more investigation going on than a year ago. And because digital has really moved from a technology to a mindset, we're seeing much more of a need for integration and modernization in technology platforms. We have been working on a series of strategies, whether it be around a middleware integration layer or just truly modern technologies a la FINkit or DNA or others. So we are seeing more exploration. We are seeing behaviors be generally consistent with what they have been. And frankly, just given some of the results that we're seeing, we're pretty pleased with the portfolio that we have today and are comfortable that we are well positioned competitively. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just on the lower license sales. I guess, tough comp aside, is the lower license sales also by design? I'm just trying to look ahead to next year and see if this creates an easy compare? Or is it just a good baseline to use for Q1 going forward? Robert Hau : Yes. Tien-tsin, I'd say it really is just a matter of timing within the year. One of the reasons why we're focused on calling it periodic revenue, to make sure we distinguish it from our processing revenue, which had good underlying growth. But we expect that to come back in future quarters and see some growth on a full year basis. Jeffery Yabuki : And Tien-tsin, I would say, you may remember when we gave guidance, we actually said that instead of using the term periodic revenue, we said termination fee revenue would be meaningfully down in 2018. We don't expect license revenue to be meaningfully down. At the same time, we are seeing more and more and more desire of institutions to acquire solutions that were traditionally licensed but now sold on a cloud or on a hosted basis. And so that does have an effect, but it's not intentional. It's more what the market is demanding. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. That's basically what I was getting at, that idea of looking for stuff on a hosted basis or what have you. Got it. Just on the Phase 4 operational effectiveness. I know you mentioned it, you teed it up a little bit. Just guessing here, is this going to leverage more maybe some of the digital and AI tools that I think we've seen Fiserv talk about, other firms talk about it. Is that the idea of what that next phase might look like, actually using some of these digital tools to sort of enhance your existing -- your business offerings? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I would say, and Bob will cringe because this will absolutely have to fall under the category of forward-looking statement. But Phase 4, we'll start to grab that in a fairly meaningful way. And Phase 5, I think you'll see a very significant utilization of those capabilities, everything from automation -- kind of technology automation a la the building of our technology all the way through VCA, RPA and other utilizations to create efficiency and effectiveness across the entirety of Fiserv. So yes, I think that's going to be very important. And that will actually dovetail quite nicely with the movement to the cloud for the majority of our technologies. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. That's fine. The last one -- sorry to ask so many. Just on that, is the outsourcing versus insourcing trend changing in your mind given some of this complexity? Because we hear mixed things in our survey work. Jeffery Yabuki : What do you mean, Tien-tsin? Give a little bit more color. Tien- Tsin Huang : More firms thinking about doing things in-house, maybe replatforming but doing it internally; or the opposite, looking for third-party vendors, either best-of-breed or full-service providers like Fiserv to do it on behalf of. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. That's a great question. It depends on probably 3 things. It depends on the psyche of the institution. Do they -- what pieces of the customer experience do they feel absolutely compelled to own and control. So that will be number one. Number two, it's do the institutions have the economic fortitude to invest in building that because it is not cheap. And then third, I think it is actually absolutely directly related to size of institution. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : Your competitor spoke about a pickup in demand. Are you seeing that as well? And if so, where are you seeing it? Jeffery Yabuki : So yes, we -- I think we mentioned in our prepared comments that we expect technology spend to increase. We had said when we -- in Q4, that we were seeing a little tick-up in demand, and that did manifest in some better sales in Q1 of '18. Remember that the demand itself doesn't translate to sales for a certain period, and then certainly revenue follows in some implementation period after that. But we are absolutely seeing a focus. And I would say, number one, it's in digital. Number two, it's around payments. Number three, it's about back-office modernization. And number four, it's really about products geared at safety and security, so think cyber perimeter, those kinds of capabilities. And then lastly, if I was going to put a category out there around innovation, I would say there's a lot of discussion around AI and RPA, but it's quite early in that exploration. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then so just sticking with that thought process, what puts you over the top on the 4.5% growth target? I know you said that Zelle was sort of a key contributor there. But what other large opportunities could you break out for us given where -- given your comments on demand? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Sure. I would say it's probably fair to remember that most of the increase in demand that we see won't really convert to revenue. You'll have little bits and pieces towards the end of the year. But really -- and I think about that as maybe a bit of a tailwind, but the majority of what's going to drive revenue for us in '18 has already been sold and is in implementation or it's very late in the sales process and will get implemented this year. And that's really around some of the larger implementations in Biller, the DNA implementations, Architect implementations, Zelle as we talked about, continuing strong growth of Mobiliti. I think we had around 25%, 25% subscriber growth in Mobiliti. We have -- we're seeing good volume in card. We talked about some interesting network innovation earlier on : flow, ease of compare. And then the last thing that's important is we have done some acquisition over the last several years, and those are starting to move from being not part of the organic growth calculation to being part of the organic growth calculation. So when you throw that all into the basket and stir it up, it's all of those pieces that are contributing to us moving to not just the 4.5% in '18, but also looking -- obviously not giving guidance, but we would certainly be looking to see a step-up in growth in '19 as well. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : There's a lot of payments change going on, and you guys have your fingers in a lot of those pies. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of consumer interest and adoption versus what banks are investing behind? And as I try and kind of guess to skate to where the puck's going to be, it seems confusing. I think things like faster payments versus traditional bill pay or peer-to-peer versus faster payments. How is that evolving from both a consumer and a bank investment point of view? Jeffery Yabuki : So that's a great question. Brett, I would say from the consumer's perspective, they don't think about things like faster payments. They think about the fact that it's their expectation, if Amazon can deliver a package in Milwaukee on a same-day basis, money should be able to be delivered in Milwaukee on a same-day basis. And so we're seeing both the modernization or the expediting of the rails to allow what we've traditionally thought about as ACH to start to move in a faster payments way, not the network, but the idea. And so whether it's -- whether we're using card rails or TCH or same-day ACH or whatever the different capabilities are, it's about creating that enabling capability within the financial institutions, having them connected, creating a broader network that connects to -- in our world, we like to think about connecting to billers or requesters of money. So creating that ubiquity, which will happen over a long period of time, and then allowing that ubiquity to be tapped by different consumer-facing or business-to-business facing applications. So Zelle as the example in P2P. We're also quite excited about our digital disbursements capability, which enables billers to -- as an example, instead of an insurance company having a cut a check, let's just allow money to move seamlessly at the speed of the consumer or the biller's choice, so creating different kinds of use cases that have this electronified network. And then I won't even go to things like check. But all of that is going on. And Brett, the other thing that's really important is how does the digital experience, how does the wallet -- how do I manage my digitally oriented, initiated movement of money via my \"bank\" experience. So our -- we get to be in the, I think the unique place of playing both on the modernization of the back-end side as well as on the front-end facing. Bill payment, for example, we are quite excited about real-time money movement. We are working on how do you take advantage of that in bill pay in a completely different way to change the bill payment experience, to have it seem much more like biller direct, but instead of having to go to 25 websites, I can go to one place and pay what I want to whom I want at the speed I want. So I think it's going to enable consumers to do things in a very different way, and our goal is to make sure that we're playing across that emerging ecosystem. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And a little bit related, the economic model of Dovetail, is that sort of network economics? Or is it sort of infrastructure economics or an arms dealer kind of software license? How do you guys see that evolving? Jeffery Yabuki : It is dependent upon the size of the institution that's acquiring it. I would say it is a combination of hosted economics, licensed economics and kind of the old world ASP or cloud economics, depending on the size institution that's taking advantage of that and what they want to do. I wouldn't be so bold as to call it network economics. But I would call it -- I would be comfortable calling it the same kinds of economics that you would see out of the -- this is in quotes, the \"high-quality revenue\" that we talk about. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Jeff, I was wondering if you can maybe give us an update on what you see relative to the M&A landscape at your bank clients. Certainly, valuations are higher across the industry and -- but your term fees are lower. So do you think that we're unlikely to see the -- a significant uptick in the consolidation despite the increase in SIFI limits? Or how do you think this plays out? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, again, Jim, I would say it depends a bit on the size of the institution. I would say the majority of activity, obviously, in the numbers happens at the low end of the asset tier because, of course, that's where the majority of the banks sit. I do expect there to continue to be transactions. I expect them to be -- I expect there to be a lower number of transactions this year over last, which is why we're predicting a meaningful reduction in termination fee revenue. And at least the conversations that we're having, we just had the opportunity to spend time with 4,400 client representatives and associates and partners. And everything we're seeing would say that the level of acquisition activity is precisely inverse to valuations. And so people are mostly feeling like valuations are high. And that with rates going up, it's a good time to build out their organic capability, which is one of the reasons why we're feeling bullish on technology spend and certainly the different exploration we would see that supports that. So I see that. We are seeing a slight, and I would make slight in all caps, tick-up in de novo activity. And so that's typically a good sign. And I think you'll see some of the larger institutions look for ways to expand more broadly as kind of the war on deposits continues to accelerate. James Schneider : That's helpful context. And then maybe a capital structure question. You kind of touched on the dividend question earlier, but can you maybe talk about that leverage ratio of just 2x? I think it's lower than many, many of your peers. Is that something you feel comfortable with permanently? Or do you think that you would feel comfortable kind of taking up leverage even if it's to fund increased buybacks even if you can't find attractive M&A candidates? Robert Hau : So I think there's 2 pieces to answer to the question. One, as we mentioned earlier, the drop in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the first quarter at 2.1x relative to where we were in December. And in fact, where we typically run is really due to the timing of the receipt of the cash from the divestiture of our lending business, the joint venture there. We certainly would expect that to go back up. We're very comfortable seeing leverage go up, if there's an opportunity to do a large acquisition. We certainly have the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our cash flow to be able to run a much higher leverage for some extended period of time and then draw that back down if we needed to. Certainly to be up more towards 2.5x would be more typical for us. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I think it's kind of an odd deal, Jim. We got a large check on -- what day? Robert Hau : The 29th. Jeffery Yabuki : 29th of March, which really took our leverage down below the 2.3 or so we had been at the end of last year. But I think we're fairly on the record that we prefer to have our leverage much up, towards 2.5. And I think the answer is we'll continue to deploy capital in the way that we have and in a way that maximizes shareholder value. Operator : Our last question in queue is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So a lot of discussion on this call about digital, and everyone has a digital mandate. I guess, my question is how does that change your contracts going forward? Are the terms different? Is the pricing lower due to more cloud-hosted delivery? Are they shorter contracts? Can you talk about that? Jeffery Yabuki : I'm only -- I'm pausing for a moment. I'm trying to get an idea. I would say that the contract terms are -- typically would be consistent with the normal contracting process that we have. And it's -- Ashwin, it depends a little bit on the type of client. So is this a digital-only client? Is it a client who buys something via 30 other services? Is it a professional services engagement? So I think the right way to answer it is it depends on the solution itself. But I would say that we believe that solutions that are consumer-facing tend to be the ones that institutions are least likely to convert because, in fact, they are facing their customer base. And so the contract terms themselves are less important than making sure that we're delivering a high-quality service to our clients so they can best serve their customers. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood, understood. And I should probably have explained the context in which I was asking the question, but you got that right. Can you speak about contactless cards? Is that an opportunity you're focused on, and particularly dual-use cards as we go forward? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean, we're quite focused and ready for contactless. The market continues to move -- the U.S. market continues to move slowly. We were quite encouraged. And one of the larger brands spent a fair amount of their prepared commentary talking about the move of contactless and how quickly it starts to -- adoption starts to burn through the base once it's started. It's really a matter of, in the U.S., getting it started. I suspect it's still at least a year or 2 years away, but it would surprise me if by the end of '19 we weren't seeing a lot more movement on that front. I think we're -- the whole way digital intersects with card-based payments, it just screams to have contactless be much more front and center. So I think we'll see it, but it's really a matter of when does the market make the move. Thanks, Ashwin, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. We always appreciate the opportunity to have dialogue and your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team, and have a great night. Operator : Thank you very much, speakers, and that concludes today's call. Everyone, thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I will turn the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Paul Seamon : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, and the impact from tax reform. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. All the share and per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and our comments are adjusted for the two-for-one stock split completed in March of this year. Also, the 2017 full year, year-to-date and quarterly adjusted earnings per share amounts have been adjusted for the impact of the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business that closed in March. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our business performed very well in the quarter, further positioning us to meet our financial commitments for the year and providing momentum as we look into 2019. Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 6% for the second time in the last 3 quarters and is 5% for the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter and has expanded in line with expectations at 20 basis points for the first half of the year. Adjusted EPS grew 32% in the second quarter and is up 27% through June 30. Sales was up 6% in the quarter and increased 13% sequentially. We remain steadfast in our commitment to shareholder value through capital allocation, with a focus on consistent share repurchase. During the second quarter, we crossed the $10 billion threshold in total share repurchases since initiating the program in 2005, including nearly $800 million so far this year. And for those keeping score, we have retired 48% of the shares outstanding over that period at an average cost of just about $22 a share. As you will recall, we have 3 key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; second, enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continued our focus on expanding high-quality revenue, recording 6% internal revenue growth in the second quarter. Revenue growth was driven primarily by acceleration in our card, biller and core account processing businesses, which also included strong license revenue in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter, and is up 20 basis points for the year-to-date. Part of the benefit of an easier adjusted operating margin comparison in the quarter was diluted somewhat, as expected, by our recent acquisitions, along with the costs of ramping up new internal revenue. Adjusted EPS was up a stellar 32% in the quarter and 27% for the first half of the year as a result of higher revenue, lower taxes and disciplined capital allocation. We are highly confident we will achieve our financial objectives for the year. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. DNA's modern architecture and true real-time processing continues to be a market differentiator. In the quarter, we were pleased to welcome Allegacy Federal Credit Union with over $1.4 billion of assets to the Fiserv family. Allegacy chose, in a competitive process, our DNA platform, along with the suite of solutions to modernize its infrastructure and to deliver further innovation and quality to their members in a rapidly changing world. We exited the second quarter with our largest sales pipeline since acquiring DNA in 2013, which has a strong bias to larger institutions. We had 11 clients go live on DNA in the quarter, and expect nearly 30 to go live for the year, roughly half which are institutions, with assets over $1 billion. We continue to see sustained growth as consumers adopt more digital services. To that end, Mobiliti ASP subscribers continued to grow, adding 24% more users in the quarter to now be over 7.5 million. As digital experiences take hold, interaction models are changing across the growing digital ecosystem. Notifi, our enterprise alerts and events platform, allows financial institutions to leverage digital channels to provide real-time information and access along with transaction security. Like many of our digital solutions, we anticipate this capability to grow and evolve over time, bolstering the relationship between FIs and their customers. By the end of the year, we should have more than 300 clients in production, which is a roughly sixfold increase for the year. We believe this enabling capability, which increases in value based on the number of integrated solutions a client uses, will grow meaningfully over the next 3 to 5 years. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Just a year after its launch last June, Zelle is quickly becoming the go-to solution for sending money. We remain focused on building our footprint through sales, implementations and transaction growth. Demand for our turnkey Zelle solution remains high, recording 35 sales to financial institutions in the quarter, which represented nearly $100 billion of underlying assets. In addition, we are pleased to expand our partnership with NCR's Digital Insight solution to offer our turnkey Zelle solution to their digital and payments clients. We had 5 institutions go live later in the quarter, including Zions Bancorporation, Comerica Bank, Bank of the West, and Navy Federal, the largest credit union in the world. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up more than 40% sequentially, and through June 30, were up more than 15x the prior year's level. We fully expect growth to accelerate as more clients go live and users adopt this real-time payments service. Cyber risk and security remain top of mind for institutions of all types and sizes. To further advance this important opportunity, we recently announced an exclusive, strategic partnership with the next-generation cybersecurity firm, BlueVoyant. We've integrated their capabilities into a unique managed services offering, providing clients with an innovative, leading-edge security platform. The market reaction to this comprehensive offering has been very positive, leading to both a strong pipeline and early incremental sales. We're quite bullish on this opportunity. We also had Blue Shield of California go live on our BillMatrix platform in the quarter, which enables a variety of health payment options across multiple platforms and channels. This launch by one of the largest Blue plans in the nation is a great example of expanding our biller network and adds to the momentum of our integrated biller strategy. Lastly, we recently announced a long-term agreement with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks to be the naming partner for a new state-of-the-art arena designed to showcase the latest in technology and entertainment experiences. Fiserv Forum, which is an intentional nod to our annual client conference of the same name, provides an unparalleled opportunity to elevate our brand, support our communities and engage our people. We believe this step further strengthens our leadership position and reinforces the need to consistently deliver on our brand promise in a time of rising expectations. We fully expect this arrangement to deliver incremental value to clients, associates and you, our shareholders, in an extremely cost-effective fashion. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was up 2% to $1.4 billion in the quarter and grew 3% to $2.7 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was excellent at 6% in the quarter and a strong 5% through June 30. As Jeff mentioned, our strong internal revenue growth in the quarter was buoyed in part by license revenue. As we previously indicated, we anticipate that periodic revenue will be down on a full year basis, driven by significant decrease in termination fees in Q4. Overall, the 5% internal revenue growth for the first half of the year is slightly ahead of our internal expectations for accelerated growth this year. As a note, had we restated our results under ASC 606, our year-to-date internal revenue growth rate would have been 70 basis points higher than we reported. Adjusted operating income for the quarter and year-to-date grew 4% to $439 million and $883 million, respectively. Adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points in the second quarter and is up 20 basis points for the first 6 months. Normalizing for the impact of acquisitions and dispositions on our results, adjusted operating margin would have improved by 170 basis points in the quarter and 150 basis points year-to-date. Consistent with our plans, we also began deploying the incremental investments from tax reform savings in the quarter, with the majority of the spend expected in the second half of the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $0.75 for the quarter and was up 27% to $1.51 for the first half of the year. In each case, compared to 2017 results, adjusted for the impact of the Lending Solutions transaction. We are very well positioned to extend our streak to 33 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. The Payments segment's adjusted revenue grew 8% to $771 million in the quarter and 7% to $1.5 billion through June 30. Strong performance across the majority of businesses in the segment, highlighted by card services and biller solutions, drove internal growth of 5% in both the quarter and the first half of 2018. Transactions and customer usage remain an important element of our business model and future growth. Debit volume growth was in the high single digits; P2P transactions, including Zelle, grew nearly 30%; and Mobiliti ASP users increased 24% in the quarter, all contributing to steady growth trend in our digital and payment solutions. The Payments segment's adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 13% to $270 million in the quarter and 9% to $542 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 170 basis points to 35%, and is up 50 basis points to 35.2% for the first half of the year, as our businesses continue to produce high-quality revenue. Those results are even stronger when considering the headwind from acquisitions that are primarily in this segment. Moving to the Financial segment. Adjusted revenue decreased 5% to $590 million in the quarter, and decreased 3% to $1.2 billion for the first 6 months due to the impact of divestitures on our results. Internal revenue growth was a very strong 7% in the quarter and 4% in the first half of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid performance across much of the segment businesses, along with an additional boost from increases in license revenue in the quarter. Although planned for the full year, there was some timing benefit for the license revenue in the quarter, which had been anticipated in Q3. The Financial segment's adjusted operating income decreased by 6% to $201 million in the second quarter and 2% to $403 million for the first half of 2018, due exclusively to the impact from divestitures. But for those transactions, operating income in both periods would have been up high single digits. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 34%, which includes the Lending Transaction's negative impact on adjusted operating margin, up 140 basis points. However, year-to-date adjusted operating margin in the segment is up 40 basis points to 33.4%, including the headwinds from the divestiture. Corporate operating loss was up $3 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% and was 21.2% for the first half of the year, consistent with our outlook. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was down 12% to $491 million, which includes the impact of the Lending Solutions divestiture. Free cash flow conversion through June 30 was lower than anticipated 78%, primarily due to the timing of both working capital and CapEx spending in the period. These results do not include the approximately $470 million of proceeds from divestitures that closed in the first quarter. And we expect to see stronger free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year. The debt outstanding was up a bit to $4.8 billion as of June 30 and remains at the lower end of our target range at 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 5.4 million shares for $390 million in the quarter, contributing to the $10 billion of program repurchases Jeff mentioned earlier. Over the first half of the year, we returned $789 million to shareholders, repurchasing 11 million shares. As of quarter's end, we had 406.1 million shares outstanding and 10.4 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. Now with that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. As I mentioned earlier, sales in the second quarter grew 6% and has increased 9% year-to-date. Quota attainment was 82% in the quarter and is 87% through June 30. Integrated sales in the quarter was up 11% sequentially to $67 million and is up 9% to $128 million for the first half of the year. Our domestic pipeline increased 20% in the quarter as institutions are actively considering investments to better serve customers and grow their top line. We continue to expect to achieve our full year sales targets. We achieved another $14 million of savings from our operational effectiveness initiative in the quarter, and for the first half of the year, have booked $32 million of savings. We are on pace to meet our goal of $50 million of savings for the year. Financial institutions are generally performing well, and we expect that to continue with interest rate increases and continued tax benefits ahead. In addition, a number of institutions have made public attestations of incremental technology investments with a focus on digital experiences and payments transformation, both of which are near and dear to our heart. We continue to see larger M&A front and center as institutions look to leverage acquired technology investments and gather deposits. We feel very good about the direction of the market and the longer-term benefits these trends hold for our focused and leading solution. Overall, let me reiterate that we are in a strong position to achieve our financial goals for the full year. We continue to expect our internal revenue growth rate to increase a minimum of 80 basis points to at least 4.5% for the year. We expect adjusted EPS for the year of $3.02 to $3.15, representing growth of 22% to 27% over the adjusted $2.48 for 2017, and anticipate that our full year result will be above the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range. We anticipate that full year adjusted operating margin will expand between 10 and 30 basis points, and that free cash flow conversion will be in a range of 106% to 111% for the full year. In closing, we are pleased with our results for the quarter and are on track to achieve our commitments for the year. And while we understand the importance of financial results in any period, we are equally focused on delivering strategic and operational progress that further positions Fiserv to deliver long-term value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. We know that we are a product of every one of our 24,000 people around the world who contribute daily to our success. It is their unrelenting dedication to our clients that enables us to deliver Fiserv at our best. We are fortunate to have them on our side. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : Great growth and congrats on the Fiserv Forum. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Dave. Robert Hau : Thanks, Dave. David Koning : So I guess, my first question, the growth was great in the Financial segment, 7%. I think, the best in many years. But sequentially, the dollars of revenue was down. Is that the new -- like just the sequential trajectory that's going to be normal now kind of post Lending? Or maybe just talk through what was kind of happening there? Robert Hau : Yes, Dave. That actually is the impact of the Lending divestiture. We had that business through the very -- nearly the very ending of the 29th of March when that transaction closed. So you see the revenue materialize in adjusted revenue, and then, of course, go away for the second quarter. So you won't see that same sequential dynamic going into future quarters. David Koning : Got you. My mistake. I got you. It was in most of Q1. That makes sense. And then, I guess, my follow-up, Q3, Q4, is it kind of a mirror image of Q1 and Q2? You mentioned the tough comp in Q4, so should that look a little more like how Q1 was, and then Q3 look a little more like Q2? Robert Hau : Yes. I think the way to think about it, Dave, is we closed out the first half of the year in pretty good shape relative to our full year guidance. And we expect the second half to look very similar, roughly in line with the first half growth. To your point, given the difficult comp on the term fees in the fourth quarter, you'll see that headwind materialize then. Operator : Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Just to follow up on the drivers of the 7% internal growth in the Financial segment, which I think was probably the best in more than a decade. If you could just unpack the drivers of that growth, let's say, breaking it down between recurring revenue growth, software license growth and then year-over-year changes in contract term fees. Jeffery Yabuki : So let me start and then Bob will add in, David. As I mean you know the business well, for us to have that kind of growth in the quarter, we definitely had an increase in periodic revenue with a bias to license revenue. We had a very strong license quarter. A little bit of that was movement throughout the year that bunched up in the quarter, so it ended up being slightly better. I think we indicated that in our prepared remarks, it was slightly better than I thought -- than we thought it would be in the quarter, not for the full year but for the quarter. And I would say that we continue to see success in driving recurring revenue in the segment. I mean, you've been tracking our progress with solutions such as DNA, we had 11 go live in the quarter alone and we expect nearly 30 for the full year. So it is more of a bias to periodic revenue moving the needle to the right, but it continues to complement the level of recurring revenue and sales that we've had in the segment for the last couple of years. David Togut : You called out 11 DNA conversions that went live in the quarter [Audio Gap] what you expected for the full year. How did the balance break down between DNA conversions expected in Q3 and Q4? Jeffery Yabuki : I don't have that in front of me, but I'm going to guess that Q4 will actually be meaningfully larger than Q3. David Togut : Got it. And then, given the strength you've called out in bank IT spending trends, what's the appetite specifically for cross-selling and up-selling? And what are the most in-demand solutions for cross-selling and up-selling? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So we talked about the fact that our integrated sales are up about 9% year-over-year, and that's a good proxy for existing clients buying existing add-on solutions. We're seeing a lot of focus on digital, on payments, on risk, kind of risk, cyber, those kinds of products. A lot of interesting movement on authentication. And then, we're quite enthusiastic about a newer offering that we have around deposit transformation. We have a -- as rates go up, we're seeing more and more institutions focus on how are they going to fund assets and being very focused on driving deposit gathering and deposit optimization, so we're seeing that as well. But a good appetite. And as a reminder, as you know, David, we -- it's a process, right? People get interested and then they look and then they hopefully buy and then we eventually implement. So the bullishness this year is part of why we said even at the beginning of the year that we expected to see a step up in 2019, and we continue to feel good about that visibility. David Togut : Quick final question on Zelle. You called out 40% sequential growth. Can you help dimension for us what the revenue contribution from Zelle might be? And then, bigger picture, where is Zelle in its development as a product? I mean, are there more features to be added, for example, social, which is a big component of the main competitive product? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So we would continue to say that transactions, while growing faster on a smallish base, revenue is starting to become measurable, but the contributions are not meaningful, if you know what I mean. But the bulk of demand to get into the network is quite high. We indicated there were 35 signings in the quarter alone. And so we see a lot of demand, and you can see in the big banks significant growth in transactions, and we know that will move its way through the rest of the ecosystem. As far as product development goes, there are -- there's a focus on enhancing the consumer experience and there's also a focus on using Zelle in new and more innovative use cases. And so we're excited to be participating in all of that. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : You just touched on this and you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks, but the Payments revenue in this quarter, looked like results were better than expected. I just want to ask the one on Zelle in -- specifically in a slightly different way. Some of the big banks have been saying they're seeing a significant step up in volume this quarter and last quarter as well. So is the uptick that you're seeing noticeable right now? And along those lines, I'm just wondering if perhaps Zelle-based revenue could contribute more meaningfully in the back half of this year? If you have any color as to the size of impact [ first ] there, that would be very helpful. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I would reiterate my comment about it being measurable but not meaningful at this stage yet. But it is -- we are seeing that aggregate effect. So more institutions going live, more transactions being created. And the network is expanding. One of the reasons why I believe that the larger banks are able to show these very high levels of growth is it has more to do with the close network utilization that's going on intra-bank, where we are a little bit more dependent in terms of getting the real movement to see much more inter-bank network. And so the more banks in the network, the better that will be. And when I say banks, I really mean banks and credit unions, so financial institutions in general. So I have a very high degree of confidence that based on the path that we can see right now, that the second half of '18 will be more than the first half of '18, which was more than the second half of '17. And the second half of '18 will be less than the first half of '19, and the second half of '19 bigger than that. And so we're going to continue to get this network effect in this growth, much like we've seen happen in other transactional businesses, whether that be the card processing businesses or the bill pay business. I think the bill pay business is quite a good proxy for this solution. And given our footprint, we think this will, in fact, become an important growth driver, and that will be for a fairly long period of time, based on everything that we can see right now. Jeffrey Cantwell : And then, just a high level one. You touched on this in your remarks earlier in terms of your own state of the union as far as the health of the banks and credit unions. If we look at FI's results this quarter, it looks like profitability is on the rise, and the tenure has been ticking back up towards 3%, which should be positive for bank NIMs overall. The question is, how would you frame what banks and credit unions are open to spending more on? You sort of talked about cyber, et cetera. Just love to get your thoughts there. It would help us think through the back half of this year, and then, what type of trajectory you might have heading into 2019 as well? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Jeff, I would say, there are a few different categories. The first category -- and I should say that these apply equally to both retail and commercial/business customers, so everything around digital experience. So the branch in your pocket or your personal payments device, being able to transact more fully and holistically in a safe and secure way on a device, I would say that's number one. Number two is really around deposit gathering. Everything that can be done to create more funding for assets given the ticking up of the tenure and the cost of money. So we're hearing more and more about banks really of all sizes looking at setting up separate deposit gathering vehicles and different ways to expand their reach. And then, third, it's really around putting the money to work. So different ways to think about lending, different ways to think about origination, servicing. We're seeing a fair amount of discussion, especially on the upper end of the asset size base, around RPA, automation, cognitive, whatever you want to say. But basically where data starts to meet robots and how can we use that to create more customized experiences, more efficiency, those kinds of things. And then, you always have the risk wrappers and everything else. But the investments tend to be more the former of that conversation. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, is it safe to say that as your pipeline grows, that the composition looks pretty similar to the growth drivers we saw in this quarter? Or are you starting to see a skew perhaps more toward Mobiliti and [ softper ]? I'm just wondering if there's a tipping point at which some of these newer solutions start to inform the growth as opposed to, say, a single-point solution like a Zelle or something like that, sort of an aggregate view? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Andrew, I would say, when you bifurcate it via growth drivers in pipeline, I actually -- we're actually seeing more larger transactions building our pipeline as opposed to smaller -- we've got play in smaller deals. But those kinds of solutions, whether they be Mobiliti or Architect or other, those tend to be transactions -- I'm sorry, those tend to be solutions that are based on transactions. And so we tend to sell those in, but the revenue will mature over time. And so a lot of the growth that we're seeing coming in right now has to do with sales that were well in the past. And I think one of the things we talked about is Mobiliti subscribers being up 24%. If you go back and look at the last 3 years, I think the plus 20% is where it's been, and that compounds quite quickly when you've got 12 or 16 quarters that are running at that kind of pace. Our pipeline on the other hand has larger, more complex kinds of projects that will actually convert to revenue faster than some of these transaction-building solutions that we're seeing benefit from right now. So I feel actually pretty good that as we think about '19 and '20, assuming our pipeline matures the way we expect it to, that, that will drive different layers of recurring revenue that is complementary to what we're seeing driving our results currently. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And with regard to bill pay, good to hear that as a call-out growth driver. Do you feel like BillPay is having a little bit of a renaissance? I know the consolidator model that, I guess, a lot of folks thought would prevail when you acquired CheckFree has perhaps given way a little bit to Biller Direct over the years. Do you see new use cases that can breathe perhaps new life into that BillPay business of yours longer term? Jeffery Yabuki : We do, Andrew. We're quite bullish. We've been spending the last 3 years working on how to create a more powerful linkage between the experiences at biller direct and what we can do in the consolidator model. So that's one thing on the experience side. And we're seeing more interest from the larger institutions on taking this capability because of the importance of the digital experience. So that's -- that we feel quite a good about it, if you think about it from a distribution standpoint. I do think that one of the ancillary benefits of something like Zelle is, the more consumers do within the mobile experience, the more predisposed they'll be to do things like use consolidated bill pay as long as they're in -- they're already doing that in Zelle. The Zelle energy will create more electronically originated payments out of the bank channels. And frankly, we've seen for a long time because, for the most part, with the exception of a little of account-to-account transfer, bill pay has been the only real killer app that's out there. Well, if all of a sudden, Zelle is the killer app, I think they will complement each other and drive growth on both sides. Operator : Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Let me just start off. Starting off, you mentioned, Jeff, the 300 clients by the end of the year using digital offerings. I guess, I just want to get a little more color on whether these are -- how many of these are existing clients that are adding -- that are taking on more of your services versus potentially new clients? And I guess, to me, it seems like that's clearly where the technology environment is trending towards across all IT services, with banks being no exception. Just wonder how big of an opportunity this could be. How big are these clients? How much can they actually spend on these initiatives around digital that you referenced earlier, first. Jeffery Yabuki : So the -- for clarity, the 300 or so clients that we would have live in production by the end of the year, we were referring to our Notifi platform, which is a technology that allows events, two-way alerts, actionable alerts, digital interaction between financial institutions and their customers. That is alongside of the probably 3,000 or so clients that we have today that are using some of our digital platforms. The beauty of Notifi is the more solutions that are Fiserv solutions, the higher the quality of the alerts and events that we can communicate out. And so not only are we wrapping a service around the data, the transactional data on a customer-by-customer basis, but that data is exponentially more valuable if you're using a debit platform and a mobile platform and a risk platform and a bill pay platform and everything else. So you've got the different pools of data being reviewed for information that's important to the customer. So that platform, we think, will eventually be across the entire mobile base because it will be the way consumers expect to be dealt with. And so, over time, that will continue to add on. I would also say that virtually every new core account processing deal we sell has Notifi in the package. Darrin Peller : All right. That's helpful. I mean, I guess, at the end of the day, when you couple that with the new DNA platforms you're signing on, and I mean, I just -- the bigger question probably ought to be how much of a capture you have from core to all the other ancillary technology offerings that you now offer on the payments side as well? And I guess, how much, I don't know if you've ever disclosed, how much cross-sell you've actually accomplished on your existing clients yet? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, it's a number that's in the billions in terms of annual revenue. But what I would say is if you look at the attach rates, they've more than doubled on average over the last 10 or so years when we've been -- that we've been doing this. But if you look at a new client, they tend to be in the 20 to 30 incremental products on top of each account processing technology. And that is -- or sorry, solution. And that is the basis of the integrated biller strategy that we introduced at our last Investor Day, taking that exact same model, and we're starting to see that strategy pay dividends, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Darrin Peller : Bob, just a really quick follow-up, I may not have heard it, but did you mention -- quantify the license revenue benefit that helped the quarter out? Robert Hau : I actually did not. For the quarter, it was kind of mid-teens, which gets us the year-to-date high single digits, $6 million, $7 million benefit year-over-year. And that is periodic revenue in total. Operator : Our next question will be coming from Matt O'Neill from Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Most of them have been answered around Zelle and some of the product initiatives. I was just wondering, from a housekeeping perspective, if there's any seasonality to the Lending business? I'm just trying to figure out if there's a -- the base year adjustment was, I guess, $71 million or $64 million -- versus $64 million in Q1. Seems like maybe $10 million shifted to the Lending -- from the Lending business into the corporate line. Maybe you could just help with the confusion there? Robert Hau : Yes. We did see some growth. There's a bit of seasonality. The second half would typically be a little larger, but of course, that's out of our numbers now going forward because that transaction closed right at the end of first quarter. Operator : Next is Bret Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : One is a housekeeping question. I think you mentioned this. The 606, can you give us the 606 impact again? It would've been a little bit better, I believe? Jeffery Yabuki : It would've been about 70 basis -- I'm sorry, for the full year -- for the first 6 month of the year, it would've been about 70 basis points higher. Robert Hau : Right. Brett Huff : Okay. And do we -- did you disclose that for the quarter? I just want to make sure I didn't miss it. Robert Hau : No. We didn't. We did disclose second quarter. Order of magnitude, it's about -- excuse me, we disclosed in the first quarter. Order of magnitude is about the same. Brett Huff : Okay. And then this is a bigger picture question. Given all the money that it sounds like the big banks are starting to spend, or at least saying they're starting to spend and use up some of their tax benefit, the numbers are really large, billions and billions of dollars. Have you seen a reaction in your -- the folks that you focus on in your smaller and medium-sized banks to that, what is effectively a big authentic push on the digital front typically? So what is kind of the reaction? And then, what is the thing that they're asking for, particularly in response to that if that's a reaction? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Bret, I would say -- I would answer your question 2 ways. First of all, we are fortunate enough to not only serve the small and medium banks but we also serve a number of the larger banks, as you know, and so we're actually in some of those conversations as well. I would say, as you start to move through the ecosystem, it's the things that we've been talking about, digital, payments, cybersecurity, deposit gathering. There are some conversations around loan origination, some conversations around wealth management. But I think the real -- what they need and want from us is to help them be prepared digitally to compete with the larger institutions that are spending, obviously, very significant dollars and setting a high bar. And so they're looking for us to make sure that we're keeping up with the proverbial Joneses. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then, last question for me. When you do the integrated payments system that you talked about last Investor Day and you think about incorporating Zelle in the new enhanced bill pay and things like that, what kind of -- are there any of your bank customers that have kind of taken that product on? And do we have enough data to see what the consumer behavior really is around that? Are they choosing Zelle over bill pay for certain transactions? Or any insight there for us. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Brett. It's a little bit early. I would say, we have a couple of clients that are out there right now. And so we're learning. Demand is quite high. So we're moderating that right now as we learn and develop. But we're going to be very pleasantly pleased with the results once it's out there. Operator : The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just on the license product side, I was curious, anything specific that was in high demand in the second quarter? I guess, that commentary is a little counter to what FIS says, I was just trying to reconcile maybe what's in demand and what's not? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Tien-tsin, I would say, it's across 2 or 3 different parameters. You've got risk products that you see movement in, we see account processing where we're seeing movement in, and in some of the cash and deposit areas, I would say. On top of the normal, we have many, many products that fit into the license category, the smaller licenses that get bundled up. And so -- and for us, we -- I don't think we're dealing with some of the things that you may have heard this morning. And so it's a -- I think it's less the sales environment than it is the implications of some of the changes that went in earlier this year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood. That's helpful. And then, just on the -- maybe on the margin front, I want to ask if your view has changed at all in terms of where you might fall on the margin spectrum of 10 to 30 versus, say, 90 days ago. Any change there? Robert Hau : I think the simple answer is no. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. Thought I'd ask anyway. Then quick last one. Just on the -- Jeff, I wanted to ask you, just the whole -- bundling together this direct challenger digital bank movement, if you will, are you seeing more activity from this group in terms of trying to go after the market? Are they starting to fill up into your -- in your pipeline? And if Fiserv has a strategy specifically to go after that market? Jeffery Yabuki : So we -- I would say that there's more conversations going on right now in exploration. We do have a solution that we have created that we think is actually quite strong for the market using DNA and several of our other solutions to create a digitally advantaged product set. But I think it's too early to know how it's going to turn out, except to say that there's a real focus in the end market on deposit gathering. Operator : Next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : I was wondering, within digital, does your comp set or your competition change at all when you go after those dollars? And what edge do you feel your company brings? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Joe. So I would say that the digital space is probably one of the most competitive segments of the market because you are dealing with a number of competitors that can range from a quasi-startup all the way up to some of the biggest providers in the world, technology providers in the world are providing a digital solution. So it is a more competitive space. I think where we are advantaged is we've been a leader in digital banking for -- going on 20 years. And we have a significant understanding of the market. We have new and modern technologies and we have some of the best experts in the field. So from our perspective, we feel quite good about our ability to compete in that space, and I think our advantages show up in our win rates, which are pretty attractive. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then, can we get an update on the overall cost takeout program? I just wanted to see where we stood. And maybe thoughts about renewals in the future, et cetera. Jeffery Yabuki : So I think, and Bob will correct me when I'm wrong on this, I think we're roughly $32 million or so... Robert Hau : That's correct, through the first half. Jeffery Yabuki : For the first half of the year. And I think Bob had mentioned in a previous setting that we would be renewing our program at the end of the 5 years? Robert Hau : Yes. So we're, right now, actually exactly halfway through the 5-year program, 2.5 years now in. We are better than halfway through our 5-year goal of $250 million. And we've indicated a few times, whether it was at Investor Day or other forums, like this type of a call, where we fully expect that we'll complete what is now Phase 3 that we're in the midst of, in another couple of years and then launch Phase 4 and perhaps someday, Phase 5. So we feel good about the results year-to-date and program to date. We feel good about the opportunity into the future to continue. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And last one for me on the capital allocation side. I imagine you're looking for assets within digital, what's particularly attractive to you in that particular arena? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. When you talk about capital allocation, our minds quickly go to share repurchase because it's our benchmark. I would say, when we think about acquisitions as part of our capital allocation strategy, we do bias to areas, payments, digital, especially in the commercial side, I think that's an area of which we continue to have an interest. But the payments ecosystem on balance is, we think, very important and will become more important over the next several years as the plumbing starts to change, and so we're focused in those areas. And then, I would say the other area that is of interest is just around data, right? The importance of data into the future. I don't think anyone can underestimate how critical that will be when you think about new decision models that financial institutions will embrace over the next 3, 5, 7, 10 years. Operator : Next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Jeff, I was wondering if you could maybe renew your thoughts on the prospects for bank M&A in the kind of sweet spot of your customer set in terms of bank size. It seems like on the larger side, at least, there has been a little bit more activity. So can you maybe share with us your thoughts and directionally where those transactions might go, up, down or sideways? And then, more specifically, on ones that have actually been announced, what your conversations have been like so far in terms of their willingness to kind of keep on your platform versus go with something else? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I mean, I would say, exactly to your point, there have been some larger transactions that have been announced this year, and I think that is indicative of larger institutions -- really, all institutions feeling a bit emboldened by the combination of rising interest rates and lower taxes, and also understanding that as institutions get larger, they have a need to put more money into technologies and creating cost leverage. So we're seeing the same kinds of things that you're seeing, and we expect that to continue for a bit. In the lower -- in kind of the smaller space, there's much more of a concern about valuation levels. And so we're not seeing as much activity as we anticipated. In fact, we've said, been saying all year, we actually expect our termination fee revenue to be meaningfully down, and that's really a product of what we're seeing on the acquisition front, or on the merger and acquisition front. So from that perspective, we are seeing that. And then, the last piece is, typically the acquiring bank is always going to have a leg up because it's their technology. And every once in a while, you find an opportunity to win one where your client wasn't the acquirer. But that is much more the exception than the norm. And I would say that, for us, for the last 30 years, we've been dealing with about the same 4% to 5% shrinkage in the number of buying units, and I suspect that will continue for the next foreseeable future. So it's just part of what we have to deal with on a regular basis. James Schneider : Helpful color. And then, maybe to follow up, I know there's a lot of questions asked on Zelle, but I just wanted to ask, in terms of the implementations, I think you've talked about 35 Zelle sales this quarter. I think you talked about 10 prior to this, so I'm not sure if 45 is the correct math or not. But can you maybe talk about over what time frame they -- you plan to bring those online because we've heard some data points which suggest there's been some delays in actually physically getting a lot of the new FIs onto the network. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, that's -- Jim, we -- I think we're on the record of being one of the people who've talked about the fact that there are delays. The only real constraint we have at this point is being able to log them in as members on the network. Now of course, it's much more difficult than that. I think, so far, we've communicated around 70 or so sales of Zelle, and we're at about 10 live, so we're pretty early in our process. I think the sales will continue to increase. And then, we're working quite closely with EWS, who is the kind of the management of Zelle, to increase capacity, and we're optimistic that, that's going to happen over the next several quarters, which we think will be fantastic for the industry. Operator : Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So I wanted to ask about digital transformation. Obviously, a big driver in terms of the nature of demand changing. But as you put in more and more of your digital solutions, the question really is can you also affect your cost of delivery or changes to your sales organization? And can you kind of flatten the cost curve, so to speak, because of digital delivery? And any way to size the impact over multiple years, any help you could give there? Jeffery Yabuki : So Ashwin, you were breaking up a little bit in there. But I would say that we've done, I think, a pretty reasonable job at flattening our cost curves in any number of ways over the last dozen or so years. I think we've taken out somewhere in the area of $700 million of costs, or in that area. And we're continuing to look at more ways to do that. As clients take on more and more solutions, there is a need to be able to increase the throughput for them because clients are going to need to move, we think, faster. And so we're looking at automation, whether it be robotics or other ways to automate more so that clients can go live faster and pull in more content into their systems to meet the changing demands of the market. So we are working on those fronts, which we think will create some efficiency for us but frankly, allow the pipes to get larger and larger. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then, a question on free cash flow conversion. I mean, normally, it kind of flows through as you go through the year. The year-to-date free cash flow conversion percent seems a bit on the low side and I want to ask about the puts and takes as well as whether by the time the year is done, we'd be kind of closer to 100%? Robert Hau : Yes, Ashwin, we indicated it actually in the prepared remarks upfront that the 78% conversion rate we've seen through the first half is [ lighter ] than we would've expected. There's really 3 things to point to. Number one, the ASC 606 doesn't impact cash dollars but does impact cash ratio or conversion rate. And that would have been about 83%, 84%, had we not had the 606 impact. But more directly, again, as we mentioned in the opening comments, we see some impacts of timing of working capital as well as CapEx that, at this point, we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. And we see a second half conversion much stronger than we have in the first half of the year. Jeffery Yabuki : Ashwin, one of the things that we've talked about is you can only be in 105%, 110% cash flow conversion for so many years. And then, sometimes, there's a little bit of a breather and there's -- you never know when that breather is going to be. We believe we'll end up above 100%, but that does happen every once in a while. And it's just about building of working capital and the convergence or the conspiracy with CapEx and all that. But we're quite comfortable that the model remains to be strong and above earnings on a regular basis. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And if I could squeeze one more in. Regulatory change has always been a end. I want to ask if sort of the easing of complexity, particularly small and midsized banks, whether it's helping? And just looking out a couple of years, whether CECL is likely to be meaningful for you guys. Any specificity around that? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So I would say that the regulatory relief has been -- and in the smaller parts of the market has been quite welcome as well as on the upper ends of the market. And so that's created some continuing momentum as people think about where to invest and is lowering the investment threshold in those kinds of products, so that's quite positive. And so, overall, that's just another momentum builder. I would say that as it relates to CECL, we do feel quite good about that. Now the smaller banks really have until late '19, early '20 to be using the technology. But I would guess that we'll measure the number of clients in the thousands for that as opposed to in the handfuls, just because of the need and because of the proximity to the core account processing systems. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Thanks for the support and have a great evening. Operator : Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Tiffany Willis : Thank you, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to be here today in my new role leading Investor Relations. I look forward to connecting with many of you in the future. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the acquisition of the debit processing and related solutions of Elan Financial Services and the impact from tax reform. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our material for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are soon to be year-over-year comparisons. As a reminder, the share and per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of this year along with adjusting the comparable 2017 adjusted earnings per share amounts in each period for the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which closed in March. And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tiffany. Nicely done on your first earnings call. Good afternoon to everyone joining us today. We delivered strong financial results, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Additionally, internal revenue [ has been ] 5% over the rolling 12 months, ending in this year's third quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and is up a very strong 26% year-to-date. We remain well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year while continuing to invest in your company. Free cash flow for the quarter was up 22% to $322 million and is over $800 million year-to-date, both of which include the divestiture impact of our lending business. We continue to focus on share repurchase as our primary capital benchmark allocating $438 million in the quarter and, for the year-to-date, have repurchased $1.2 billion. Before we dive into the results, let me provide perspective on the approximately $690 million acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services, which closed today. This acquisition, with annual revenue of over $170 million, extends our leadership in payments, broadens client reach and scale and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing 3,000 debit solution clients. We're excited about the opportunity to extend our Payments franchise and welcome more than 300 talented associates to Fiserv. Scale is becoming increasingly important in the payments network and processing businesses. We have spent the last several years quietly migrating more than 1,200 clients to a single debit platform with our most advanced capabilities. We plan to leverage those experiences to successfully migrate the more than 1,000 acquired Elan clients to our platform over the next couple of years. We see revenues synergy opportunities across 3 primary areas. First, we have a number of solutions in our existing card portfolio to make available to the existing clients in areas such as the ACCEL network, enhanced risk, card production and digital capabilities, such as CardValet. The acquisition also provides a couple of new solutions, which are additive to our portfolio and should contribute to internal revenue growth. As part of the transaction, we acquired Money Pass, the second-largest surcharge free ATM network in the U.S. with over 33,000 in-network ATMs. In addition, we acquired a small but strong ATM Managed Services capability, which extends our existing ATM offerings and payments differentiation. The third opportunity is to provide other Fiserv solutions outside of card payments as the substantial majority of the acquired clients are not currently Fiserv account processing clients. Over time, we expect to compete for new revenue opportunities by demonstrating our solution strength and integration advantage. Overall, we believe the synergy opportunity from consolidating to a scaled, market-leading platform will add value to the acquired clients and deliver meaningful cost benefits over the next 24 months. We also believe the revenue synergies to be equally significant but will have a longer ramp given existing client contracts and sales lead times. We generally expect to be at the revenue synergy run rate over a 4- to 5-year period. Given synergy timing, we expect this transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings in 2019 and to grow over time. With that, let's move to our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are : first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we achieved 5% internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date, driven by strong results from a number of our businesses, including card, biller and bank solutions. Internal revenue growth is up 170 basis points versus the comparable 9-month period and is 5% for the trailing 12 months. As you know, we are making and we will continue to make investments to ensure your business delivers sustained competitive advantage and excellence for our clients, balanced against delivering results that are consistent with expectations. To that end, adjusted earnings per share was up 23% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date from a combination of operating leverage, tax rate reductions and capital deployment. These very strong adjusted EPS results were delivered in spite of a 100 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and down 20 basis points year-to-date. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to the lending divestiture, margin-dilutive acquisitions and the investment pool established from tax savings earlier in the year. But for these items, adjusted operating margin in the quarter and year-to-date would have been up 60 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, compared to the prior year. We continue to believe we will achieve our revenue and earnings commitments for the year, consistent with our first shareholder priority. Our second focus is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution. DNA is positioned as the leading charter-agnostic real-time account processing platform continued with 8 signings in the quarter. We announced the addition of CFCU Community Credit Union with over $1 billion of assets to our new Digital Edge solution suite, which is anchored by DNA. In a competitive process, CFCU selected our comprehensive digital-centric platform to provide their members access to our leading digital and payment solutions integrated into DNA. Market interest in Digital Edge is growing, and we believe it will be a longer-term differentiator for the digital-first market. We had 8 DNA clients go live in the quarter and a total of more than 20 since January. We expect nearly 30 DNA clients to go live in the year, which would be a record number of annual implementations. We continue to see important growth both for us and our clients across our digital banking solutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew by 23% in the quarter to just under 8 million. Due to strong demand, we have expended our Architect implementation teams and expect to bring 12 clients live in Q4 alone, which will double the number of go lives for the full year. We anticipate exiting the year with strong Architect sales, a large implementation backlog and continuing market momentum. We're seeing interest in sales activity in platform modernization with our recently acquired Dovetail Payments Platform. We are pleased to sign Union Bank with $160 billion of assets to enable their connectivity to the TCH real-time payments network. We also signed BBVA Compass with nearly $90 billion of assets to help modernize their enterprise payment capabilities in the shift towards real-time settlement.  We were recognized in the quarter by IDC for our Real Result Award for next-generation payments for enabling Instant Payments in our Dovetail solution for Intesa Sanpaolo, the leading bank in Italy with a strong international footprint. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Zelle continues to garner significant market focus and attention, leading us to sign more than 50 new Zelle clients in the quarter. We were also pleased to bring Dollar Bank, with $8.5 billion in assets, live in the quarter. We expect a continuing ramp of new Zelle clients in Q4 and meaningful acceleration in 2019. We remain focused on ways to accelerate implementation cycles to meet the growing market demand. Zelle transactions were up more than 50% sequentially, and through September 30, are more than 10x the prior year level. Our conviction in Zelle remains high as financial institutions accelerate their focus at the intersection of digital capabilities and real-time money movement. Lastly, we are seeing additional interest in our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions the opportunity to provide their customers with instant access to deposited funds. A top 10 bank selected our solution in the quarter to address this evolving opportunity and plans to offer this service to their customers across multiple channels. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue was up 1% to $1.3 billion in the quarter and 2% to $4.1 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across a number of our businesses, and is also up 5% for the 9-month period. For comparison, our reported internal revenue growth through September would have been 50 basis points higher had we restated our results under ASC 606. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was down 2% to $425 million and, for the year-to-date, was up 2% to $1.3 billion, both of which were impacted by the Lending Transaction. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 31.6%, a decrease of 100 basis points, and was down 20 basis points through September 30. The performance in the quarter includes a 160 basis point headwind from a combination of the lending divestiture, acquisitions which closed last year and the impact of a client-focused incremental investments funded through tax savings. This headwind was partially offset by 60 basis points from our strong operational effectiveness performance and operating model leverage. We now expect 2018 adjusted operating margin to expand about 10 basis points, the low end of the range, given a slower ramp of acquisitions, including Elan, which closed today, and high opportunistic in-year investments. Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $0.75 in the quarter and increased 26% to $2.26 to the first 9 months of the year. Based on our strong performance to-date, we expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for a 33rd consecutive year. Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 6% to $779 million in the quarter and up 7% to $2.3 billion year-to-date. Strong performance in our card services and biller businesses drove internal revenue growth of 5% for both the quarter and first 9 months of the year. Increased adoption and growing transaction volumes remain important elements of driving high-quality revenue growth. In the quarter, debit transactions were up double digits, and total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle, grew nearly 50%. Additionally, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 23% to nearly 8 million, continuing to reinforce the importance of digital in the evolving landscape of financial experiences. Adjusted operating income in the Payments segment grew 5% to $260 million -- excuse me, $267 million in the quarter and 7% to $809 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 40 basis points to 34.2% and has expanded 20 basis points to 34.9% for the year-to-date. Segment-adjusted operating margin results were negatively impacted by 140 basis points in the quarter from a combination of the headwind from acquisitions and the investments from tax savings, which were included in our guidance shared at the beginning of the year. For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue decreased 7% to $574 million for the quarter and 4% to $1.8 billion for the first 9 months of the year due to the Lending Transaction. Internal revenue growth, which considers the divestiture, was up a strong 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date driven primarily by solid performance from our account and item processing businesses. The Financial segment's adjusted operating income decreased 8% in the third quarter to $187 million and declined 4% to $590 million for the year-to-date, again, due to the Lending Transaction. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 32.7% for the quarter and expanded 20 basis points to 33.2% for the 9-month period. But for the Lending Transaction, segment margin would have been up by 120 and 160 basis points in the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. The adjusted corporate operating loss was up $6 million in the quarter due primarily to a difficult prior year compare but fully in line with our plan and consistent with the 2018 run rate. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was slightly better than our expectations at 19.7% due largely to a discrete tax benefit realized in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September was 20.7%, and we continue to focus on strategies to sustainably lower our tax rate. And accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%. We continue to deliver significant free cash flow, generating $813 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was better in the quarter at 104%, nearly double the rate from Q2, and is now 86% for the 9 months this year. The results for the year have been pressured by combined impact of working capital timing and the impact of ASC 606. Now given our visibility into Q4, we expect to be around the low end of our free cash flow conversion rate outlook for the full year. We repurchased 5.6 million shares in the quarter for $438 million and have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through September 30. We have now exceeded, for the first 9 months of the year, the total amount repurchased in all of 2017. We had 34.9 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization, which includes a new authorization for 30 million shares approved in the quarter. We had 401 million shares outstanding as of September 30. During the quarter, we issued -- excuse me, during the quarter, we issued $2 billion of new 5- and 10-year notes at a blended rate of 4% and an average maturity of 7.5 years. We used those proceeds to pay off our term loan, retire our $450 million 4.625% interest rate bonds that were due in 2000 -- excuse me, in 2020, and paid down a revolving line of credit. Although interest expense will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and next year, it was a great opportunity to lock in attractive rates ahead of an upward trending market. Also, because we completed the 2020 note pay-off in October, our balance sheet at quarter's end did not fully reflect the results of the refinancing. Lastly, we extended the term of our revolving line of credit through 2023 and used it to finance the Elan acquisition, which closed earlier today. Our long-term debt, excluding the revolver, is now entirely fixed rate. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.4x at the end of the quarter, which does not reflect the retirement of the 2020 note. Had that been completed as of September 30, our debt to adjusted EBITDA would have been 2.2x. Now with that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales performance in the quarter was off a bit more than expected, coming in at 69% of quota and declined 29% from the prior year. The sizable amount of the decline came from 2 large long-tenured transactions in the prior year period. Normalizing for contract term only, sales would have been down by 13% in the period. Year-to-date, book sales are down 8% but up 1% when adjusting for the term differential. Quota attainment for the year-to-date was 80%. The domestic pipeline continues to grow and is up 30% over the prior year. We expect very strong sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to make excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives. We achieved another $13 million of savings in the quarter and are at $45 million attainment for the first 9 months of the year. We now expect to exceed our annual goal of $50 million of savings. The financial services environment remains strong, with rising interest rates, positive tax momentum and a benign credit landscape. We continue to see meaningful demand in areas where we have invested, such as consumer and commercial digital, risk management and real-time payments. The Zelle opportunity remains robust as the industry looks to claw back the P2P space and create technology optionality for the future. M&A remains active as financial institutions continue to focus on gaining scale and increasing deposit balances, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. As we said upfront, we remain on track to achieve our key financial objectives for 2018, which includes an increase in our internal revenue growth rate to at least 4.5% for the year. As a reminder, for comparison, last year's fourth quarter was our strongest internal revenue growth quarter of the year. We also expect to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Given where we are in Q4, we now expect the full year to be in a range of $3.10 to $3.15, strong growth of 25% to 27% over the adjusted $2.48 last year and $0.08 higher than the bottom of the original range of $3.02 to $3.15. You will recall that our full year results anticipate incremental investments funded from tax-reduction savings of at least $25 million for the full year. As Bob indicated, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be around 10 basis points, and free cash flow conversion to be about 106% for the year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and our progress in building your company. Internal revenue growth is 5% and well ahead of last year's comparable growth rate. Adjusted EPS is up a very strong 26%, supported by operating leverage and operational effectiveness program benefits and also includes incremental investments to further sustain competitive advantage. As important, we continue to allocate capital to build value for shareholders, including a record pace for share repurchase, an enhanced debt structure and the acquisition of Elan's debit assets and a move to deliver incremental value for both clients and shareholders. We also remain committed to a continuous 360-degree view of excellence. Last month, we received the results of our annual associated engagement survey. And after recording a fifth straight year of improvement, have now crossed into the top quartile of associate engagement of the participating employers and their more than 3.5 million employees. And while we aren't done yet, we are grateful to the 24,000 Fiserv proud associates who bring their best every day for the company, its clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. David Togut : I'd like to start with a question about the Elan Financial Services acquisition. Thanks for giving the revenue from Elan. Could you break out what expected EBITDA will be on an annual basis? Robert Hau : Yes, David. Thanks for the question. Good afternoon. Overall, as you heard in our prepared remarks, that business will add about $170 million of revenue to us. We're just now closing as of this morning, so it'll be a nominal impact for the 2018 results in fourth quarter. And when we get into 2019, we'll certainly incorporate that in overall guidance. It's a nice business for us. It's right up the alley of what we do in our debit card processing business today. And as Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, gives us some really nice opportunities for synergies over the next couple of years from a cost synergy standpoint as we bring those -- that scale into our existing debit processing platform and, over the next 4, 5 years, to drive some meaningful revenue synergies. So we're looking forward to getting that business online and driving that revenue and cost synergies over the next 4, 5 years. Jeffery Yabuki : So David, I -- to the exact question of will we provide EBITDA. The answer is we don't give that kind of a breakdown, as I know you know. But I would say that we would expect that business to maintain margins consistent with our debit processing business, especially as we migrate, as Bob mentioned, we migrate it over to our platform. Over the next couple of years, we're moving from having they run on their own platform, to U.S. Bank, we're going to obviously migrate them to our platform. So we think that there are meaningful cost synergy benefits that will come in. One of the reasons why we're saying it's moderately accretive next year is obviously we'll be moving that forward as we migrate clients over to our platform. David Togut : Understood. And then on the third quarter earnings call last year, you gave a preliminary 2019 earnings outlook of $3.50 a share. On a split-adjusted basis, based on what you see in terms of the underlying margin expansion of the business, bookings, revenue trends, is that $3.50 outlook still intact for 2019? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So I would say, Bob is making sure that he gives me the normal look. I think what we told you is specifically we were not giving guidance. But based on what we could see at the time that we expect it to be in that range. I would say that nothing has changed since we talked about that previously to where we are today. I would say with one exception, and that is, as Bob mentioned, we did a fairly meaningful refinance in the quarter, and that's going to add some additional interest expense, which we expect to cover the same way we cover everything else from an operating perspective. I am not saying we won't be there, and I'm not saying we will be there. But I am saying that that's the one thing that I can think that's a little bit different than it was when we talked last time. Conversely, we've acquired Elan. We expect that to be accretive. So I think when we give guidance, we'll be giving guidance that's consistent with what we have been saying all along. David Togut : Got it. And then just a quick final question from me. Money20/20, MasterCard debuted new bill pay exchange offering. And I'm just curious if you compare that on a feature-functionality basis to kind of CheckFree's core bill pay offering, how does it stack up? Is this sort of a significant competitive threat or not so much? Jeffery Yabuki : Not so much. David Togut : And why would that be? Jeffery Yabuki : It's not so much -- we -- as you know, that technology has been a market-leading technology for a long time. And the beauty in our technology is the data. Not only can we move money at any speed consistent with what a consumer wants, but we know how to perfect a payment and we know how to manage risk on those payments. And so we are able to take money out of accounts when the consumer wants it because we have a risk model, a patented risk model, that allows us to make smart, intelligent decisions on that basis. But the most important part is we know how to make sure the money goes where it's supposed to go even if the consumer who will occasionally tell us the wrong thing. So we just think it's a more advanced technology. By the same token, we all see a very significant opportunity to electronify the nearly half of the bill payments each year that still are not moving on an electronic rail. So we're glad others are talking about it. But we believe right now we maintain a meaningful and important strategic and competitive advantage. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : So I guess, first of all, I'm just wondering, so Q3 revenue is a little lighter than we thought. Was there some periodic revenue maybe that's moving into Q4? Because Q4 seems almost a little better than we thought, and margins in Q3 are a little weak. And usually that periodic revenue carries pretty high margins. Is that kind of what's happening here? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. And we -- you know well that periodic revenue comes in when, to a large degree, it decides it wants to come in. In Q2, remember, we said we had a little bit of a pull from Q3 to Q2. In Q3, we actually have it shifting from Q3 to Q4. And so because of the margins, that also follows. So we do expect -- I think we tried to give a little clarity last quarter when we indicated we expected the first half and the second half to be substantially similar, and we're absolutely on track for that. So no -- nothing other than the shift in revenue -- sorry, the periodic revenue, as you know. And then the other piece on margin, just to add a little bit more clarity. If you look at the last 3 years, Q3 has been our weakest margin quarter, and most of that, to your question, comes from movement of periodic revenue between quarters. And it just so happens that Q3 tends to be an unusually weak periodic revenue quarter for some reason. David Koning : Okay. And I guess how much down was it year-over-year in Q3? Jeffery Yabuki : It was not down meaningfully in the quarter. To the prior, it was down relative to our expectations for how the periodic revenue would flow through the year. Robert Hau : David, if you think about it, we had a good first quarter. We had a very strong second quarter, to Jeff's point. Some of that was timing of periodic revenue actually shifting out of third quarter. We ended up, in the first half of the year, at 5%. We expected the second half to be similar in growth rate in total versus first half and expect Q3 to be the strong quarter within the half with Q4 being a little bit lighter given the tougher comp in the fourth quarter. That's still the case, but we'll be more normalized because Q3 came in a little bit lighter and Q4 will be a little bit stronger. But it's a shift within quarters. It's not a year-over-year thing, per se. David Koning : Okay. And just one quick follow-up. The $3.10 to $3.15 this year includes a little bit, I think, a couple months of the lending business in the first quarter, so you'll lose that next year. Is Elan -- the benefit from Elan, the accretion from that bigger than the lending EPS that you kind of lose next year? Robert Hau : No. The lending income -- operating income in the first quarter of -- excuse me, the first quarter of '18 will be a little bit stronger than the first quarter from Elan in '19. A little bit bigger business. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : I actually have a couple, if I may, Jeff, and maybe both of you guys could actually weigh in. You call out sort of investments, and you do so consistently and maybe a little bit more so this quarter than others. Could you just talk a little bit about IRR thresholds or philosophy in terms of how you deploy and when you deploy capital to reinvest in the business? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So philosophically, the investments that we make, we think more about the capital trade-offs as opposed to maybe a traditional IRR. So if we're going to make incremental investments, we think about how does that compare to share repurchase, just like we would with an acquisition. And how does that end up impacting our competitive position in the market? The problem with IRR is just you can do lots of things with terminal value to make the IRR be whatever you want it to be. And so we tend to stay away from that as a metric, unless we're doing very large incremental allocations of capital, which we are not. The reason why we referenced it in this quarter and maybe a little bit more to your perspective is because the margin was a little bit lighter in the quarter than I think people expected. We were trying to call out this idea that, that $25 million pool, that at least $25 million, the third quarter was the first quarter in which that really started to hit. We'll have an even bigger hit coming in next quarter. And so pointing that out and also looking for other opportunities to invest in a year where, frankly, we're going to deliver 25% to 27% EPS, looking for ways to expedite investments in technology or feature function, we think, is the right way to think about capital overall. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. So in the context of sustained kind of earnings growth and organic revenue growth, I guess? Jeffery Yabuki : That's right. That's right. Well, sustaining and hopefully increasing, right? Our strategy is to increase this year at 4.5%. It's roughly an 80 basis point increase in internal revenue growth. We are -- based on what we can see right now, we would expect to see some lift in that moving into '19. Of course, that's not formal guidance. But we would expect to see that as we continue to move forward. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And then if I may, recognizing that Elan is a lot about debit processing, you also, as you mentioned, acquired Money Pass and a Managed Services business. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about ATMs and generally how they fit into sort of banks' priorities and whether there's an opportunity for a third party like Fiserv that outsources just about everything else that community banks do to provide more outsourced services around ATMs? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean, from our perspective, when we hear clients talk about how the digital world, right, will intersect with the physical world, ATMs continue to be front and center in that device-centric type strategy. And so we're still seeing that, and we're actually hearing more people want to add sophistication to those ATMs. For us -- and so given the scale that we have over 3,000 clients who we -- most of them, we drive ATMs for as part of our EFT and debit proposition, we see this to be actually a pretty attractive incremental service, outsourced service, that we can provide. We have stayed away from services like that historically for 2 reasons. Number one, we didn't have the expertise. And number two, it takes a little bit more capital than we tend to use, right, for going out and acquiring the ATMs. But just given how the world is morphing right now, we think it could make some sense, and we'll spend the next couple of years looking to see what can we add in terms of service offerings to those 3,000 clients. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : Jeff, you've led this company for many years. You've seen how it performs through various business cycles. Now clearly there's a lot more focus right now on macro risk versus EBITDA 3 months ago when you last spoke with us. So I want to ask you what your thinking is at this point in time as far as how you expect this company to perform if the U.S. economy moderates to some degree in the future. And then what operational levers might you be able to pull in order to manage through the cycle? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Jeff, I mean, we are in a period where we are investing significantly in technologies that are linked up with digital -- kind of the digitization of financial services along with the need and soon to be mandate to move to a real-time monetary ecosystem. It's hard for me to see how either of those trends will moderate even if the economy itself begins to slow a bit. So I think that, based on where we are strategically, that will continue to be a fairly strong defensive play as we have been and frankly in all of the other cycles. That said, if in fact, we see a slowdown that starts to negatively impact financial services, I would expect us to be able to take steps such as slowing down the investments. And one of the things -- if you go back and look at our data, you'll see that we've meaningfully increased our level of spend as a percentage of revenue over the last 3, 5, 7 years. And most all of that drives future internal revenue growth. We think one of the beauties of our model is we can pull that back as needed without impacting the current level of internal revenue growth and create incremental flow-through of free cash. So I think we're pretty well positioned. We think about that all the time, as you might imagine. And we like the fact that we have that lever as well as -- I think we've demonstrated for the last 10-plus years, a strong ability to reduce, reign in and restructure our costs overall. We talk about it as operational effectiveness, and I'd expect us to be able to do more of that as well as needed. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens. Brett Huff : One question on Dovetail. That was an interesting acquisition to us, and it sounds like you guys got a couple of pretty big contracts, and I know that you serve a lot of very large banks, especially in bill pay. Any thoughts on in moving upmarket maybe in specific verticals or maybe even the core account processing. But is there a strategy about moving upmarket? Or is this more about digital and immediate payments, and you're just going maybe where the demand is right now? Jeffery Yabuki : It's really a combination of both. I mean, we, Brett, as you know, have a number of large clients who work with us on bill pay. We also have a number of large clients who work with us on digital. And we see that interesting interaction to just open the door to allow us to come in and talk about how the rails are evolving, and that was the back strategy. The other thing that you probably know is PEP+, which is the majority of the ACH in the U.S. goes over PEP+ today, is owned by us, and we see a nice fit between Dovetail and PEP+. So being able to help clients who we've served for years on payments modernized with Dovetail is also part of the strategy. So it's coming together. The market will move at the pace it moves, but we were pleased with the results in the quarter, and the pipeline looks good, and hopefully, we'll continue to make that progress. Brett Huff : Great. And then also there's been a lot more focus, I think, on helping banks or banks looking to do more alternative deposit gathering, not necessarily having to own the deposit-gathering function itself using partners, things like that. Some of those are featured on Money20/20. I know you guys do some of that. Can you just remind us of the various things you do, whether it's alternative lending, things like that? What kind of products, given your digital focus, have you been developing? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. The majority of the things that we're doing are certainly focused on lending. We're doing work, as I mentioned, this is a little bit of an offshoot, but we're seeing more and more banks look to set up separate Internet brands to be able to go out and gather deposits. We do some work with some third parties who are -- who basically are brokering deposits across the -- more on a partnering and integration basis who are moving deposits around the ecosystem. And then, as you mentioned, things around Immediate Funds, which is about attracting noncustomers into branches, things like that. Operator : The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I want to ask on your comment on the strong sales expectation for the fourth quarter. What type of -- what do you see in the pipeline in being able to replenish the backlog and whatnot? Is there -- I feel like I ask you this every year, Jeff, but is there a concept of budget flush maybe that might be beneficial? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. We do talk about it as we should. We -- you have kind of the year-end budgets. That's always the case. Fourth quarters are always strong. We had some larger sales slip from Q3 to Q4. That's part of the revenue movement from Q3 to Q4 is also due to some of those sales. So we have that. And we have, whether it is around the payment rail transformation, you've got a lot going on there, Zelle, DNA, a lot on the digital front, whether it be Architect or others. So there's -- the same kind of trends I think by -- also connected to the urgency of we've got to get it done this year so we can spin the project up and get going for next year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Okay. That's good. So the -- as my follow-up on the margin front, you've covered a lot of it, I know, but just to be clear on my side, is the incremental change in the margin outlook, is it Elan? Because the tax reinvestments, I know you contemplated maybe the timing wasn't contemplated. Just trying to better understand what changed that you're seeing there? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. Are you talking about from being 10 to 30 to going -- to saying it's going to be about 10? Tien- Tsin Huang : Right. What's incremental to get to the 10? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. There are a couple of things. I would say the biggest one is the acquisitions that we brought in last year as well as the impact of Elan. They're ramping a little bit slower. They've been -- the sales cycle took a little longer. So instead of us signing X deals, we sign Y deals. So things like that around the acquisitions. I would say that's one. Elan will be moderately dilutive as well. And then you've got the incremental investments that was due to tax reform. We've been looking for -- given how the year is progressing, are there some incremental investments we can make that none of them are material by themselves but just a few million dollars here and a few million there, not to diminish a few million, but it adds up, and it has a basis points impact. So it's really those kinds of things. Operator : The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Maybe just returning to the question of sales for a moment. I think you talked about some of the slippage from Q3 to Q4, or I think on a full year basis or year-to-date, the quota attainment still feels a little bit light. Is that just the size of the deals? And maybe can you maybe address the whole topic of competitiveness of new deals because some of the sales commentary from some of your peers seems quite robust over the past couple quarters. I just wanted to square those 2 issues. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So the answer to the first part of the question was really around larger deals were the ones that were slipping. So they have an impact. We mentioned the fact that we had the term adjustment, which had an issue on our comparative sales. I think as a -- it's kind of squaring it, we are seeing a very robust sales environment. Pipeline's up 30% year-over-year, and it's both strong at the late stage as well as in the early stage. I think we probably give a bit more information than others in terms of exact percentages and things like that. So it's a little bit easier to see how our quantitative data ends up playing out. I would also agree that the 80 is a little bit light. But again, we're expecting a very strong fourth quarter and think we'll be quite well positioned for next year. James Schneider : That's good to hear. And then maybe just on the financial side, free cash flow was actually down slightly year-to-date, and you talked about some of the factors that are driving that and some of the investments, I assume, that are playing into that. Can you maybe talk about as we head into 2019 what levers you're able to pull to kind of get that free cash flow back up to where it normally would be? And is that an issue of conversion percentage? Or is it an issue of lower CapEx as a percent of revenue or maybe some of the factors there, please? Robert Hau : Yes, Jim, it's Bob. We are nominally down just a couple million dollars -- a few million dollars on $800 million year-to-date number. The largest driver of the year-over-year performance is the lending divestiture, and it's a business that generated good cash that we don't have anymore. So it's in our last year numbers. We didn't adjust or make any modifications to last year's actuals. So that's probably the biggest driver. You saw on our third quarter numbers, the conversion rate jumped up very nicely to 104%. We've been a bit behind the overall year-to-date conversion rate. It's not what we would typically expect. And that's really driven by timing of working capital as well as CapEx spending. Some of those investments that we've talked about with that reinvestment of the tax savings is also bringing capital spending. So that will moderate into next year. We expect to have a very strong fourth quarter and hit the bottom end of the guidance range of the 106% for this year and be in good shape into 2019 and beyond. Jeffery Yabuki : But just to clarify as it relates to the cash flow itself, it's really a matter of the Lending business, a little bit more CapEx, things that should come back to a more normalized route. Operator : The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, as you look at kind of the backlog of the business, the sales you're anticipating in the fourth quarter, what percentage of revenue do -- is already kind of -- I hate to use this word, but in the bag for 2019? And what do you still have to kind of backfill? Jeffery Yabuki : So on balance, our recurring revenue is in the 80% to 85% range, depending on what year you're in. So I think that's a reasonable proxy to say certainly, that's -- using the notion of in the bag, I think that's a fair way to think about it. But we also have line of sight into a whole bunch of additional revenue below that -- I'm sorry, above that recurring revenue number. So it's a fairly small number. Ultimately, that is kind of in the go-get category. But if it's -- even if it's 5%, it's 300 and change -- 300 million and change. And because 10 million is 1.25 points roughly, Bob's going to tell me it's really 12 million, but it's in that range, you can have those shifts just because of the 25 million to 30 million a month that is in that 5% range. Kartik Mehta : And then, Bob, just the tax rate for 2019, do you anticipate it to be similar to 2018? Or are there things that might change for 2019? Robert Hau : No. We came out with the original guidance of 22% to 23%. And I would think that as kind of a more normalized rate. This year will dip just below that given some of the discrete tax items we had. But of course, we're always looking for that. In fact, I think it's one of the things we pointed out in the prepared remarks. That's an expense line that we look to manage, but 22% to 23% is kind of a long-term normalized rate for us. Operator : The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Ashwin Shirvaikar : You guys gave a lot of good color on sales, appreciate that. I guess larger deal slippage, I mean that happens. Larger deals also tend to be competitive in many ways. So I guess the question is if the deals and ramps push out more or if you suppose don't win, can that affect your internal growth rate? Or do you believe this year's internal growth rate is sort of a good assumption thinking ahead into future quarters? Jeffery Yabuki : Well, that -- I'm pausing because, sure, these larger deals and smaller deals tend to have a competitive element. The pipeline that we're talking about that is up 30% is actually weighted on the basis of our belief that we will prevail or not. Now things happen, and sometimes you lose transactions that you don't think you're going to lose. And certainly, if we lost a bunch of things that we were expecting to win, it could have an impact on revenue this year and, frankly, next year. I think that's always the case. We feel pretty good about where we are right now and that we'll achieve the, at least, 4.5% internal revenue growth. But to sustain that over time, obviously, we have to continue to win. And we'll make sure that we're doing what we need to do from a product and a go-to-market perspective to ensure we will win. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it, got it. And then on the debt, I mean, paying up to ensure a fixed rate would -- to me, it's sort of a -- in some ways, a bullish sign because it kind of probably implies that you kind of think that can continue to improve. And that would imply things for the spending environment. Things like that. I guess is that a fair hypothesis in terms of kind of as you speak with bank executives with regards to what you're hearing about spending intentions for technology and so on and so forth. And then a quick question at the end of that, what is the new cost of debt? Jeffery Yabuki : So let me take the -- even though I know the answer to the last one, I'm going to let Bob take that, Ashwin. Yes. The spending environment is quite bullish. I mean, right now, everyone in financial services knows that technology investments have to continue to be made to keep up with what's going on, on the digital transformation front. So there's lots going on there. There's still a ton going on around cyber, other kinds of risk and then, in this whole -- the whole notion of this payments revitalization. So there's a lot of that going on. Most of those \"decisions\" have been made to do things. Now it's a matter of finding the right partner, making the decision, making sure they have the right resources in their own shops to get this done. That is one of the -- one of the constraints is do the financial institutions have resources on their own side, not just us, but to pair up to be able to get things done. But there's a lot of energy and focus. And in fact, I would say that there is a higher level of motivation now to get things done because people can see what's on the other side of the wave. And what's on the other side of the wave is this intersection of digital and payments, money movement, new financial experiences, all of that. And we haven't even begun to talk about cognitive technologies, RPA and where that's all going to go. And in order to do that, you have to get some of the other legacy systems cleaned up. So it's pretty good. From that perspective, pretty bullish overall. Robert Hau : And let me just answer your question on the cost of debt. After this refinancing, we're just under 3%, about 2.9% after tax. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Pretty good. Can I just squeeze one last one in, just to get a fuller explanation on? You mentioned the acquisitions have had a slower ramp. Is that -- I mean, was that a product issue? Or what led to that slower ramp? Jeffery Yabuki : I'm sorry, Ashwin, which product are you talking about? Ashwin Shirvaikar : No, no. When you said the acquisitions that have had a slower ramp... Jeffery Yabuki : Oh, sorry, acquisitions. I'm sorry. I thought you said something. I thought you said activations. It's all about sales cycles. So it's about how long -- so we announced a couple of Dovetail Payments Platform transactions. It's about the how the sales cycles have gone in terms of how long it took for people to get comfortable that we were going to continue to invest and win. And then just the cycles on the client side took a little bit longer. So that idea is the main slowdown that we've seen relative to what we expected to happen. Does that make sense? Ashwin Shirvaikar : That makes sense. Yes. Yes. Got it. Jeffery Yabuki : Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team, and have a great evening. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Tiffany Willis : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and the anticipated combinations with First Data, including expected benefits, financial projections, synergies, financing and timing of as well as the ability to close -- complete the transaction. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Today's presentation is neither an offering of securities nor solicitation of a proxy vote. The information discussed today is qualified by the registration and joint proxy statement that Fiserv and First Data will be filing with the SEC. You should review that information carefully. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. As a reminder, the share and per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of 2018, along with adjusting the comparable 2017 adjusted earnings per share amounts in each period for the sale of a majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which also close in March. And with that, allow me to call -- turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Yabuki : Thanks, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, key elements of our shareholder value proposition are to steadily increase our internal revenue growth rate; convert that to growing streams of free cash flow; and last but certainly not least, allocate that capital in a shareholder-friendly way. We accomplished those objectives in 2018, and made important progress in building your company's future success. We achieved an 80-basis-point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year to 4.5% and also achieved our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Results in the quarter, which are consistent with our preliminary results announced on January 16, include 4.5% internal revenue growth and a 33.4% adjusted operating margin, both against a very difficult prior-year compare. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.84 in the quarter and up a very strong 25% to $3.10 for the year. We also generated an all-time high in free cash flow and allocated a record $1.9 billion to shareholders, repurchasing more than 25 million shares for the year. Sales were extraordinary in the quarter, finishing more than 30% higher than last year's record sales, including our largest account processing win ever, enhancing our growth profile entering the new year. Before we provide detail on the results, let me make a few comments on our recent merger announcement with First Data, which we believe creates the preeminent global provider of payments and financial technology. We expect this strategic transaction to move the industry forward in new and exciting ways. Early client reaction has been extremely positive, and centered on the ways in which the combined solutions can come together to create unique value for them and their customers. The model is compelling, with leadership positions across multiple solutions and numerous ways to grow and prosper. We also intend to enable meaningful new client value along several axes, through increased investments and strategic solutions; unique and compelling end-to-end integration; and as important, by identifying new and unique sources of value at the intersection of technology, innovation and data. We're approaching this opportunity with excitement as well as a steadfast commitment to excellence. We've kicked off integration planning and expect to hit the ground running when we close. Our priorities include unlocking client value, capturing the meaningful synergies, and retaining and attracting the best talent. We have skilled, experienced integration leaders driving the process, accompanied by strong governance and oversight. We are highly confident we will achieve the incremental revenue synergies of $500 million and the $900 million of cost benefits shared in the original announcement. In addition to this transformative transaction benefiting clients, we are equally as focused on creating significant shareholder value. We expect to generate upwards of $4 billion of annual free cash flow over the next several years, and we'll continue to use our disciplined capital allocation strategy to optimize value in the aggregate as well as on a per share basis. Our collective enthusiasm about the combination with First Data is even greater now than it was on the day of announcement. With that, let's get back to reviewing performance and start against our 2018 key shareholder priorities. Our first priority was to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution. And third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on high-quality revenue growth acceleration, delivering 4.5% internal revenue growth in both the quarter and the year. The 80-basis-point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year comes from multiple sources, including the cumulative effect of adding recurring revenue with a direct link to client value. We also expect another lift in our internal revenue growth rate for 2019. Our strong adjusted earnings per share performance was due to a combination of internal revenue growth, tax leverage and operational effectiveness. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was below the prior year, primarily due to a 110-basis-point headwind from the combination of the Lending Transaction announced in March and the meaningful internal investments funded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted last year. But for these items, adjusted operating margin would have increased 80 basis points for the full year. Our second priority was to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution. Now as you may have seen earlier today, we announced the largest new core account processing sales win in our history. In a competitive takeaway, New York Community Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for New York Community Bank, with over $50 billion of assets and locations in 5 states, selected DNA and a package of more than 40 solutions, including debit processing, Corillian Online Banking, Mobiliti, Zelle and Dovetail to deliver differentiated high-value solutions to their customers. The combination of modern, real-time technology with significant flexibility is allowing us to meet the changing needs of larger financial institutions. DNA also continued its momentum with large credit unions, signing Fox Communities Credit Union with $1.6 billion of assets. Fox Communities selected DNA as their business had outgrown their existing core processing provider. DNA provides a platform for future growth, eliminates a number of third-party vendors, and will allow Fox communities to continue serving their members with excellence. Overall, DNA performance was strong, with 30 implementations for the year, including 16 for institutions with assets greater than $1 billion. We also signed 29 new clients for the year, which is indicative of the continuing momentum of DNA. Equally important, we signed 30 new account processing clients to our market-leading Premier platform during the year. Interest also remains high for our digital and payment solutions such as Architect, Commercial Center and Dovetail. Banc of California, with more than $10 billion in assets, selected Architect and Commercial Center in the quarter to better meet the rapidly changing expectations of their retail and commercial customers. Additionally, both KeyBanc, with over $130 billion in assets; and Bank OZK, with more than $20 billion in assets, selected Dovetail in the quarter. We expect to see more institutions take steps to enrich and extend their payments capabilities to meet the evolving needs of a digitally centric landscape. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to see strong demand around Zelle. As you have likely seen reported, Zelle transactions now exceed $400 million and grew 75% year-over-year. We expect broad industry adoption to accelerate over the next 24 months, as evidenced by the nearly 100 new clients we signed for Zelle in the fourth quarter alone, which is more than the total signings in the first 3 quarters of the year. As the leading provider of Zelle services to all-sized financial institutions, we have opportunities to package our payments value proposition in unique and interesting ways. For example, in the quarter, MUFG Union Bank, with $124 billion in assets, selected both our turnkey Zelle solution to be implemented later this year, along with the Dovetail Payments Platform to help enable real-time enterprise payment capabilities for their customers. Overall, we believe our leadership, as the most experienced standalone as well as integrated Zelle provider, will enable us to deliver payments innovation and client value to the financial industry. Lastly, PennyMac, a top mortgage lender, selected a broad suite of products, including debit processing, electronic billing and a unique mobile wallet to meet their customers' expectations. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've heard, we are pleased with our strong 2018 performance. Adjusted revenue was up 2% in both the quarter and the year to $1.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4.5% in the fourth quarter and full year, driven by solid performance in both segments. The fourth quarter results were even stronger when considering last year's comparative performance of 6% internal revenue growth. Adjusted operating income, which was impacted by the Lending Transaction, was in line with the prior year at $492 million for the quarter and up 1% to $1.8 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.4%, which is a decrease of 60 basis points compared to last year's record results. As we've shared all year, our adjusted operating margin performance includes structural headwinds from the Lending Transaction, along with investments funded from tax savings. These 2 items had a negative margin impact of 160 and 110 basis points in the quarter and year, respectively. Adjusted EPS was up 24% at $0.84 in the quarter, and increased 25% to $3.10 for the year, marking our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Payments segment has had strong performance all year and did so again this quarter. Adjusted revenue was 9% to $865 million in the quarter, and up 8% to $3.2 billion for the year, which includes 2 months of impact from the acquisition of the Elan debit processing business. Integration with our card services business is in flight and progressing well. Internal revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, led by strong performance in card services, biller solutions and electronic payments, partially offset by lower periodic revenue. Organic debit transaction growth was high single digits in both the quarter and year. Adjusted operating income in the segment grew 9% to $315 million in the quarter and 8% to $1.1 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin performance in the quarter was a very strong 36.4%, in line with last year, and expanded 20 basis points to a new high watermark of 35.3% for the year. The client-focused investments funded from tax reform negatively impacted the Payments segment results by 120 basis points and 50 basis points for the quarter and year, respectively. An important element of expanding high-quality growth is extending our digital and payments footprint. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 21% in the quarter to cross 8 million. We also continued to add clients to our unified digital platform, Architect, with 7 implementations in the quarter and 19 for the year. In addition, we signed 26 new Architect clients in 2018, further demonstrating the market opportunity and importance of digital. Lastly, P2P transactions from both our Popmoney and Zelle solutions grew a combined 74% for the quarter and 44% for the year, showcasing the strong growth potential of these important DDA-based payment technologies. Zelle volume alone in 2018 was up more than 6x the prior year. For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was down 8% to $615 million for the quarter, and down 5% to $2.4 billion for the year, both of which were significantly impacted by the Lending Transaction. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 4% for the year, driven primarily by solid performance across our account and item processing businesses. Adjusted operating income was $208 million for the quarter and $798 million for 2018, both of which declined due to the Lending Transaction. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.7%. And similar to my comments on the total company results, the Financial segment adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by the Lending Transaction and tax savings reinvestment, totaling 190 basis points in the quarter. But for these items, adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points, even in light of reduced periodic revenue from the very strong fourth quarter performance last year. For the year, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 33.3%, which reflects a 150-basis-point headwind from the combination of that Lending Transaction and tax savings reinvestments. We expect the combined impact of these items to be fairly muted on our total company adjusted operating margin results in 2019. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $31 million for the quarter and $122 million for the year. Both the quarter and full-year results were in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% and 21.6% for the year, both lower than prior year due primarily to the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect our tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We generated record free cash flow, exceeding $1.3 billion this year, highlighting a hallmark of our business model, significant free cash flow generation. Free cash flow was up 7% for the year, which includes a reduction due to the Lending Transaction. Free cash flow conversion was 146% in the quarter and 102% for the year. Conversion was slightly below our initial expectations, primarily due to higher working capital and increased CapEx, which we expect to moderate in 2019. We repurchased nearly 9 million shares in the quarter for $689 million, and over 25 million shares in 2018, returning a record $1.9 billion to shareholders. Since inception of our share repurchase program, we retired nearly 482 million shares for $11.4 billion, or more than 60% of the shares outstanding at the start. And as of December 31, we had 393 million shares outstanding and 26 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. And as you know, in conjunction with the First Data announcement, we have deferred any additional share repurchase until the transaction closes. Total debt outstanding at the end of the year was $6 billion, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.6x. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffrey Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. Sales in the quarter was up 31% to an all-time high, which is even more noteworthy when compared to the record level on last year's fourth quarter and was 114% of quota. Sales for the year was up 5%, and we attained 91% of quota. Integrated sales was also very strong in the quarter, up nearly 30% over the prior year, and 131% sequentially. Importantly, we exited the year with a domestic pipeline that, even after our record sales, remains nearly 20% higher than at the same point last year. We are pleased with our sales results and market momentum. We made excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives during the year. We achieved another $12 million of savings in the quarter and $57 million for the year against our $50 million target. As of the end of the year 3, we have already booked $200 million of the expected $250 million 5-year program. In the aggregate, we have captured nearly $800 million of saves over the last dozen years. For 2019, we expect to achieve $50 million, which would close out our $250 million 5-year program one full year early. Before we get to guidance, let me provide some perspective on the environment. We continue to see the market moving to places where we are focused, such as payments and risk, all things digital, and delivering a world-class core account processing ecosystem. We believe this evolving paradigm will require market participants to increase their investments in technology, focus on data insights and reengineer their customer journeys. Given these trends, coupled with the current macroeconomic environment, we believe M&A will continue to be active, an example of which we saw earlier today. We firmly believe financial institutions will increase their technology investment and, where possible, spread that across larger scale, extend their deposit gathering capabilities, and create differentiation in how they go to market. On balance, these trends are very consistent with our strategic hypotheses and reinforces the actions we have taken to position your company for long-term success. Now looking ahead to 2019, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to step up and be in a range of 4.5% to 5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.39 to $3.52, representing growth of 10% to 14%, which is measured against the revised 2018 result of $3.08, which reflects the remaining impact of the Lending Transaction. We expect our adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, and we anticipate our free cash flow conversion to be more than 105% for the full year. For modeling purposes, we anticipate that our financial performance will accelerate into the second half of the year, creating additional momentum as we go into 2020. Importantly, our guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction, which we expect to close later this year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our financial, operational and strategic results for the year. We further strengthened the business and are excited and optimistic about the future of your company. We were recently named by FORTUNE Magazine as a World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row, and received high marks for long-term investment value, financial soundness, people management and social responsibility. This important recognition underscores our commitment to excellence and innovation as a global leader in FinTech. As we look to 2019, we remain committed to delivering high-quality results, including an increase in internal revenue growth, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. Lastly, let me recognize and thank the 24,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to delivering excellence for clients and shareholders each and every day. I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far, and even more optimistic about our collective future. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Jeffrey Yabuki : Darrin? Darrin Peller : Just start off -- Jeff, can you just start off with any market feedback you're hearing from customers either on -- on either side, First Data's customers or perhaps your own banks, since the deal was announced? Would love to hear some -- a quick spot check on the sentiment. Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes, sure. So obviously, we spent a substantial majority of time with our clients, although a number of clients have multiple relationships. May -- I have to say the client reactions have been incredibly positive, both in terms of 2 strong companies coming together. As you know, Darrin, Frank and his team have done a great job in rebuilding First Data, and I think the fact that we're coming together, people see the opportunities, those opportunities that we've talked about, whether they be around bank merchant; opportunities around network enhancement and enriching the payment -- the end-to-end payment opportunities; and even some clients who have said, \"Hey, now that you guys are together, we want you to take a look at this business that we would not have otherwise done, had you not come together.\" So the feedback's been great, positive; probably more positive than we would've thought to this date -- to the date so far. Darrin Peller : That's great to hear. And just a quick follow-up, I mean, look, we saw your community announcement today, and obviously, you're showing strong integrated sales again. I guess, first of all, if you can give us a little bit more color on what drove the win on New York Community. I think it was a competitive process. And then on the strength on the integrated sales, I mean, if you could just maybe rank order the top 3 areas you're seeing differentiate yourselves right now in this quarter [ and next, last ] quarter, that'd be great. Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. Absolutely. Thanks, Darrin. So the world -- as the world becomes more digitally centric, we're clearly in an environment that is real-time. Many of the core banking systems in the U.S. are not real-time, and so there's been a lot of focus on do I take the step to real-time now, or do I wait? In this case, New York Community made a determination that they wanted to go with real-time. The second thing is they wanted the flexibility of an API-based system, more modern technology. And then third and just as important is the suite of products that we bring in, everything from online and mobile to payments hub technology and including -- had we already been closed on the First Data, I'm sure we would've looked at this as well. So the belief that we're going along into the -- into digital payments in real-time is the thing that helps move that end of the market in. So from that perspective, that's all great. On the integrated sales front, it's really around digital. So whether it be Architect or Mobiliti, a lot of movements on payments, Dovetail payment hub, Zelle, and then a fair amount of energy on just risk and fraud to make sure that, as the more complex digital ecosystem comes together, that they're able to protect themselves. So a lot of focus on those areas. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Can you talk a little bit more about Dovetail? It sounds like we're seeing more traction at least than I expected on that. I know it's a bit of a Swiss Army knife asset. Can you give us the main driver? Is this a payments hub future-proofing kind of thing? Or is this -- are there specific use cases that people are going after? Or is this a cost savings focus? Can you just illuminate that a little bit for us? Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure, Brett. I mean, it's a little of all of those things, although I do have to say, I like the Swiss Army knife metaphor because that actually fits pretty well. Where you have some trends going on, as you know, in the market that are having people take a look at the payments back-office infrastructure that you have. So whether it be around TCH or other real-time use cases, the opportunity is to pair up Dovetail with Zelle and have a different way to move money. There's also a fair amount of focus going on right now around updating and enriching wire capabilities. So those use cases are making it more tangible to think about it. The other beauty of Dovetail is we can install the hub and toggle capabilities as if and when clients need them. So in some cases, you've got clients who want everything; in other cases, they may only want wire. But we're enabling everything, and then giving them what they want when they decide they need it. And it is -- it was consistent with our strategic thesis when we bought Dovetail. It's taken us a little bit longer. We said throughout the year it was part of why we were seeing some slowness in sales is these are longer, more technical sales. But as we're seeing them ramp up, they're beginning to get some nice momentum, and we expect that momentum to carry, really, for the next couple of years as all-sized institutions think differently about ACH is really the standard and moving in more to a real-time or near real-time capability. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And a follow-up, another product question. Can you talk about bill pay? In [ the Fed ], you have a market-leading bill pay position and have also kind of migrated some of those things to the NOW Network. How does that fit in with the new group of merchants that you all are likely to have once this deal closes? Are there any specific ways or rails or things that we should be thinking about on how you connect the bill pay with some of those merchants? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. I mean, we're very excited about the fact that First Data has, call it order of magnitude somewhere around a 40 share in the U.S. in merchants. And that is in fact an element of a rail, and so we're certainly examining, is there a different way to electronify the standard consumer-to-business payments. We're also quite excited in thinking about combining some of the capabilities that we have in our cash management technologies, along with not just the retail piece of RXP, but also the business-to-business piece of RXP and the size of the merchant databases, which are quite significant. And then looking at really how can we expedite payments, not just in the consumer side, but in the business-to-business side as well. So we see a lot of optionality there. It's one of the areas in which we believe we'll ultimately invest to help enhance the way businesses move money. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : Yes. So I guess first of all, in the FI segment, the margin decline has gotten bigger over the last 3 or 4 quarters. Is that just -- you were having a pretty good year. You were kind of flexible in terms of what you could spend on investments. I know the Lending -- that sale obviously contributed. Is that what's kind of happening? And does that allow the margins to grow at an increasing rate through 2019 in that segment? Robert Hau : Yes. Dave, it's Bob. Probably the biggest driver of the margin into the second half of the year is really the ramp of that tax savings reinvestment. We announced that launch at the very beginning of the year, and by the time we really got it ramped and running, it was really into the third quarter, into the fourth quarter. And so you saw more of a significant headwind of that in the second half of the year than you did in the first half of the year. And of course, that will abate somewhat into 2018 (sic) [ 2019 ], so we hope to see margins lifting as part of the 50 basis point margin -- at least 50-basis-point margin expansion we've forecasted for next year. Jeffrey Yabuki : We also had, Dave, a fairly meaningful decline in periodic revenue in the quarter, of which a big block of that comes in the Financial segment. So that also had a real impact in the quarter. Robert Hau : That's a big driver for fourth quarter. David Koning : Yes. Okay, got you. And then the follow-up question, I guess, in payments, does Elan have significant seasonality? And is it -- is there enough cost savings and margin improvement that, that actually drives some of the margin expansion in payments? Or is that a little bit of a drag still in the first full year? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. I think you should think about it as a drag in the first full year. We've obviously accounted for that in our 50 basis points of -- or at least 50 basis points of positive margin expansion this year. But it is going to drag us throughout the year. I don't see them having different seasonality than the rest of our card business, but there is going to be more card utilization in Q4 versus what we would see, for example, in Q1. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : I was just wondering, and apologies if this has been answered already. If you look more broadly at the bank landscape, what do you think today's merger announcement says about the prospects of foreseeing additional actions more downmarket in your traditional client base? And maybe just talk about what you see in the bank consolidation environment generally speaking, please. Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. So we talked a little bit about this in our prepared remarks. I mean, in my opinion, this is an example of a couple of good, strong banks who decided that they're going to go harder at some of the larger banks, and they're going to look to consolidate to create more capacity to invest in technology. I think there's a real recognition of that importance, including an announcement where they're going to increase their technology spend meaningfully. I think that is what we're seeing across the ecosystem in terms of looking for different ways to spend money on technology. There's a real need to do that, whether it be digital, retail, risk, payments, all of those areas, many of the things that we've talked about and weaved in throughout our prepared comments. We have been saying for a couple of years we've been seeing a fair amount of M&A. I think that's going to continue because scale is going to matter. There's a lot of focus on deposits -- deposit gathering. And for us, the good news is even though we will continue to have the same kind of consolidation in our base that we've seen for the last 30 years, I do think that the places in which we are going long are the places in which the investments are occurring. And I also think that -- I think it will send a message to the industry when you're seeing companies that are both strong come together to be a better company. We think 22 days ago, we made a similar announcement. But Jim, I think that's what the message is in that announcement today. James Schneider : That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about, relative to the revenue synergies you expect to see over the 5 years post transaction close, which are the 1 or 2 items that you think you could see soonest in terms of either the cross-sell opportunities or the network side or the card processing side, or just the pure cross-sell of acquiring services? Maybe just kind of talk through what you see kind of coming and materializing first, second and third and the progression to the $500 million. Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. So I mean, I think as part of our original announcement, we said we expected nearly $100 million of actual revenue synergy in the first 12 months post close. And a big part of that is because we believe, by the combination of the networks and the ability for routing opportunities and different forms of network innovation, that we will be able to by virtue of the combination without having to go out and sell and implement and have lead time, but just doing things in a more cohesive way. With the scale of the company's coming together, that will create some incremental value there. I think the second thing is we're going to have a good amount of success in the merchant bank space. And one of the things that we've been very pleased about is that the feedback coming from the community institutions all the way up through the largest banks, there's a lot of interest in how can we take the things that we're doing today, whether it be digital and core, and integrate them with merchant, and we will work on that and have -- be as expeditious as we can in getting that into the market. So I think we'll actually see benefits coming from that fairly early in the process. Again, part of the nearly $100 million. But I think we'll see sales ramp up a little bit faster than we originally anticipated. And then we'll have a number of different products to sell across both sets of client bases through the normal. Think about it as our integrated sales, and I think that will probably be third in that order. Operator : Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to revisit the BB&T-SunTrust deal. Can you help us understand to what degree there would potentially be an impact to your P&L from that transaction? Are they both customers of yours? Or is there any risk of consolidated pricing there or of losing some of the business? Or if you could just speak to that, I'd appreciate it. Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. So both SunTrust and BB&T are good, long-term clients of ours, and we expect that, that will continue. Of course, it's only been a few hours, but we have no reason to believe that, that will not continue. The kinds of services that they are using from us we think are fairly well-provided across the base and they're not generally the kinds of things that you can combine. So bill payment would be a good example. So we think that, that will continue to be -- will work well for us. They're also clients of First Data, and I assume that they will continue to be good clients of First Data. So for right now, we feel like there will be opportunities for us to do as much, if not more, given some of the things that we're doing and some of the investments that we believe they may make given the transaction. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask about DNA and this New York Community Bank win, which is impressive. This is kind of a proof point that DNA is -- definitely appeals to a larger asset-sized institution. I mean, what does the pipeline look like for larger-sized deals here? Is this kind of more of an outlier? Or are you really seeing the momentum moving sort of upmarket with DNA? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. Ramsey, that's a great question. Thanks for the kind remarks. We have been -- interestingly, for the last couple of years, we have been very pleased at where -- how we have played in the kind of the larger bank RFP process. So we have, basically, in every large deal that has been done over the last couple of years, we have been a finalist in the -- in an RFP process, so in the competitive process. And frankly, one of the things that's been a little bit of a challenge is it's hard to win your second one until you've won the first. And now that we have won this, we've won several banks that are in the $30 billion range. We now believe that this takes us up to the next level. And we are the only real-time, modern technology platform in the U.S. that's U.S.-based and U.S.-centric, and we do think this will help us. Now we also recognize that there are not 100 of these going a year, but there are enough of them to matter. And as you know, we typically are really great in payments, in digital, in mobile and risk and those products up in that end, but we have not had the momentum in core, and we think this is a great step in the right direction. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos. Georgios Mihalos : Just again, maybe thinking about the First Data acquisition and all the assets and the services that, that brings to you. Now you obviously have the merchant capability. You're more robust on the issuer processing side. You also get sort of a stronger switch. Is there an opportunity, as you think of sort of recreating a network to sort of put something in place kind of similar to what a very large bank like Chase has done with sort of a ChaseNet type product. Is that something that's on the road map for you guys? Jeffrey Yabuki : I would say at this stage, we are in the process of evaluating a number of different opportunities. Certainly, looking at all of the different ways in which we can create network value for our issuer clients and our merchant clients is quite high on the list. Frankly, our focus at this stage has been more around where are the opportunities to innovate in the progression of the merchant capability, and where are the ways to integrate in the progression of the issuer-merchant connectivity. And so we see some really intriguing opportunities there around digital enablement, around real-time connectivity between what's happening at the point of transaction all the way back through cash management and back into the core account processing system. Frankly, we believe that what -- one of the things that makes us unique is not just that we have the issuer and the merchant piece, but we have the core engine as well wrapped up by the back-office payments. And so we see a lot of opportunity there, especially as the world moves more to real-time. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but we're still early in the process of evaluating those kinds of opportunities. Georgios Mihalos : Great, appreciate that. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow up, sort of a housekeeping item. How should we be thinking about the term fees in '19 versus '18? And maybe if we look at the 50 bps of margin expansion, kind of thinking about that between the Financial and Payments segment. Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. Thank you. Robert Hau : Yes. For 2018, it was down a bit. I would expect 2019, in total, from a periodic revenue standpoint to be up modestly, call it flat relative to what we saw in 2018 actual. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair & Company. Christopher Shutler : Jeff, could you give us a sense, when you look at your FI customers, how many have merchant bank capabilities today and how many you view as kind of viable candidates for merchant acquiring? Jeffrey Yabuki : It's a really interesting question. And it's only interesting because there's really no bank or -- and many credit unions who don't have connectivity to merchant. What we have found in the community space is an incredible amount of fragmentation, very few institutions have kind of an all -- going all in with a single source. It's much more around letting the merchants to some extent make those decisions because people like us haven't built out the technological advantages around integration that we believe we're going to be able to build. So we think it's very much a greenfield space. And the key is going to be how will you begin to prioritize the combination of front book and back book, and how the institutions are focusing on their end market. And again, the second piece is how do you make it easy through integration into the core system for banks to be in a place where they can better serve their merchants and create some economic value for them at the same time, and we think there's a reasonable amount of value for banks to capture. And we like being in the point where our technology is actually making money for banks as opposed to costing them money. Christopher Shutler : Great. And then just one clean up. The 2019 guidance for EPS. Can you just confirm that -- whether there are any share repurchases in that guidance? Robert Hau : We -- essentially, in our overall guidance, 10% to 12% growth off of the 2018 actual result incorporated the deferment of our share repurchase through at least close. And that range essentially encompasses a variety of potential outcomes there. Jeffrey Yabuki : Okay, Chris. And I think I would clarify by saying Bob really meant to say 10% to 14% of EPS guidance. I think what -- I mean, what -- we obviously are not buying back shares at this point, and we have to get to close. I think what we would say is our 10% to 14% assumes whatever the different scenarios are that we believe will happen throughout the year. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer & Co. Glenn Greene : I wanted to go back to sort of the booking and sales environment. The 30%-plus number in the fourth quarter was obviously great. But I'm curious how broad-based it was. Or was it skewed by New York Community Bank? How much? And obviously, you've got the pipeline up 20%. So it certainly feels like the environment's really good. And just sort of a secondary question on that, is New York Community Bank's scheduled to convert at all in '19? Or is that more of a 2020? I'm trying to understand if that impacts the organic growth in '19. Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. So I would say, Glenn, that the sales for the quarter were incredibly broad-based. A lot of activity across virtually every line. And many, many, many of the sales were on an outsourced ASP kind of cloud environment, right? So a lot of future recurring revenue that's going to get booked. The part of it is -- the second and third quarters were not great, and so we had some pickup in the fourth quarter for that. But the fact that we had such a big quarter ended up, up for the year, year-over-year, even though a little short of quota, and the pipe is still up nearly 20%. We, like you, view that as being quite positive. And we like what's in the pipeline, the kinds of transactions that are in the pipeline. As far as New York Community goes, there will be a bit of positive impact in '19, but the substantial majority, or the big boost, will come in 2020 and beyond. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just quickly, I don't know if you have any more thoughts, it's only been 3 weeks since you announced the merger. But the $900 million of cost synergies, I'm just getting a sense -- trying to get a sense if there's any other sort of low-hanging fruit you found. And would you be willing to share a little bit sort of thinking of the timing of how quickly you might have realized that. Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. So I would say that, as we referenced in our prepared remarks, that we're highly confident in both the $900 million of cost synergies and the $500 million of incremental revenue synergies over the period. I think when we made our -- when we talked about this, we talked about the fact that it's a little bit of a barbell. We expect to get a lot of benefit in the first couple of years. We're talking about a net 20% accretion, which obviously also takes into account the interest saves, which are not part of the $900 million. Then you start to get to some things that are a little bit tougher. You do work and you have it come back in. I would say at this stage, we've gotten the integration kicked off. We're taking a look at things. Depending on if you're asking Frank or me, we're more bullish on the timing. Bob and his counterparts are a little bit -- they're going to try to give us the Heisman on that a little bit. I -- we feel very good about the $900 million. We feel good about the timing that we've talked about. And you can be sure that just like what we do in our operational effectiveness work, we're going to do everything we can to bring that in early. And we'd like nothing better, although this is not guidance, but we'd like nothing better than to get done earlier than we anticipated so we could get to the Phase 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and everything else, to build upon the muscle that we built in Fiserv for the last 12 years. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Brendler of the Buckingham Research Group. Christopher Brendler : One quick question on the merger. If I look at the cash flow projections on the pro forma company, it looks pretty powerful. And your leverage guidance, I'm getting a pretty significant variance on the -- as I pay that down. Can you talk about potentially the merger and sort of integration cost, and how significant those might be in your plans? Jeffrey Yabuki : Sure. Thanks. And Chris, it's good to chat with you. So I would say that our plans around generating the free cash and the, call it $4 billion-ish over the next few years, I mean, we're certainly feeling quite good about that. I think on balance, we've said that we expect the -- and Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, we basically expect the one-time cost to be somewhere in the area of the $900 million of synergies. And so I think that's the general rule of thumb that we're using. And that will probably go a little bit ahead of the synergies because you typically are spending the money as you book them and not -- or as you lock them down and not necessarily as they come into the P&L. But I don't think they'll be gigantic differences in the flow of that. And then as it relates to the leverage ratios, remember that what we've talked about is that we're going to suspend -- or sorry, defer share repurchase between now and closing, and then we'll reevaluate what we have going on. We think the combination of the growth and EBITDA and the payback potential out of the significant free cash flow that we'll generate will allow us to pretty quickly get back to our more normal capital allocation strategy, which typically includes buying back shares. So we think that there will be a combination of tracks, paying down debt, repurchasing shares, and probably doing little solution-oriented acquisitions again at some point, with the first 2 taking precedence. Bob, does that... Robert Hau : Yes, exactly right. Christopher Brendler : That makes a ton of sense. And if I could ask a follow-up on -- you mentioned on the merger call the opportunity with Clover potentially within the Fiserv client base. And just sort of fascinated by that possibility. Can you just give me sort of the -- how you view Clover, both as part of the merchant business and the potential to bring that into banks today and offer them a Square-like solution? And also, what's your thinking in terms of the core business -- the core processing business and how they could use Clover? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. Sure. So I mean, we're really very bullish about the ability to bring Clover into the community banking system for a couple of reasons. First of all, we like the fact that we can drive, we think, a really powerful end-to-end integration advantage. We can digitally enable that to make it easier for merchants to be able to select, on their own, that technology if they decide to open an account online. We envision being able to also sign up as a Clover merchant in that same process, so digitally enabling that element of the value chain. And then most importantly, it's a really attractive technology. It will be in a place where we can combat -- banks can combat Square if they so choose. And then lastly, and probably most importantly, is we believe that by integrating this into the core account processing systems, that we'll be able to create a data advantage for the banks vis-a-vis what they could have done otherwise, and allow them to better serve their SMBs and also to optimize their revenue, which we see happening in some of the larger institutions. So we're really excited about that, and our banks are as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : Can I just circle back on something? You sort of just touched on this. I guess a little context for you here. We cover Community Bank. That's a client of yours, and they're excited to see what you do with Clover, right? So I guess the crux of the question, should we expect Clover as a potential offering by your bank partners using online? Because we know that from First Data's standpoint, digital distribution was a big initiative of theirs with their larger JV partners. I guess what I'm trying to drive at is, is offering Clover on all of those financial institution websites a realistic outcome from all this, even if it may not be a near-term focus? Can you just give us your thoughts there? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. And Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I mean, we realize as well as you do that one of the issues has been a lack of digitally enabling the selection of Clover or other merchant capability. And First Data has done a great job of building out the -- basically the procurement capability, but have not been able to enable the whole process. One of the beauties of what we bring to the party is not only do we have the core system, but in many, many cases, we are also the digital enabler, hosting websites, doing lots of those kinds of things. We're serving somewhere in the area of 110 million digital users today in the U.S. We have 140 million accounts that we're processing for. And so when you bring that together, we do see opportunity. Now to your point, we think it will take some time to figure out the right way to do that. But that's pretty high on our list just given the opportunity that we see and the opportunity that the clients see as well. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : I had -- I should ask like a multipart one, right? It's been a long day for me, too. Yes. So on the -- everyone's asked about sort of the cost synergies. I wonder, just 2 parts, and I'll ask them upfront. First, on the $500 million of revenue synergies, can you break that down for us? Is that cross-selling versus new products versus other products? And then the second part of that question, which I'll just ask upfront. Traditionally having covered FTC and having covered Fiserv and the core processors, you're selling into different parts of the bank with different decisions and different people. And I'm wondering, as you start to see this come together, how do you bridge that gap? I -- with a core processing system necessarily -- or someone who uses a different core processing system necessarily convert because you've got merchant acquiring? Or is it all from the outside-in as you talked about with Square, et cetera? Jeffrey Yabuki : Yes. Absolutely. So let me take the first part of that first. So when we announced the deal, we talked about 3 distinct buckets of value. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue synergies, so 40% of the $500 million would really be around merchant bank, merchant bank acquiring services. The second bucket was around really payments, network innovation, expanding our payments offerings and network innovation, that was around $250 million. And then the last $50 million was around integrated sales, just generally cross-selling across all of the things that both of the companies do, and that's really around the world. And again, we provided numbers that we were highly confident that we would be able to achieve. I would also put in one other caveat. We also talked about the fact that we made a $500 million incremental investment into technology, into supporting the technologies, and that is separate from the $500 million. So the benefits of that $500 million aren't accounted for in that -- in the $500 million of revenue synergies. So we continue to feel good about that aspect of it. As it relates to the second part of your question, really around -- to your point about the core processors and payments. In the largest banks, clearly, that's going on separately. You've got the back-office payments, people looking at payment hubs. And you've got front office payments looking at cards. And you've got core looking -- no one in the largest banks have really for the most part looking at core, but certainly that would go into a different place. In the core, even in the New York Community Bank level, that size institutions doesn't have the fragmentation that you're talking about, and these things are looked to be bought together. And because we have such strong relationships, whether they be digitally-based or payments-based or core-based, in the, call it everything but the top 10 banks, they're less fragmented than having to literally go to a bunch of different people. Once you -- and maybe it's 15. But for the most part, the relationships that we have and First Data have are going to be extensible and not going to be as murky as it will seem on the surface to go in and be able to talk through the value. In fact, many, many, many clients are wanting to do that already. Of course, we have to wait until we close to be able to go out and do that. But the conversations and the enthusiasm is certainly out there right now. And we're not seeing any issues around that kind of fragmentation or silos coming from the financial institutions or the merchants. Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We always appreciate your support. If you have any follow-up questions or need additional information, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and the anticipated combination with First Data, including expected benefits, financial projections, synergies, financing and timing of and the ability to complete the transaction. Forward-looking statements may materially differ from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. As a reminder, prior year adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the sale of a majority interest of our Lending Solutions business which closed in March 2018. And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance carried the momentum of last year into the first quarter, highlighted by 5% internal revenue growth and 12% adjusted earnings per share growth. We also followed the record sales in last year's Q4 with one of our highest first quarter sales totals ever, further validating the demand for our market-leading solutions. Our better-than-anticipated start to the year has us well positioned to achieve our full year financial commitments. In addition to serving clients, engaging associates and delivering strong financial results, we are also focused on integration planning for our First Data combination. Along those lines, shareholders overwhelmingly approved with more than 99% support the issuance of Fiserv shares in connection with the merger. As you know, we received a second request for information on our transaction from the Department of Justice and are working cooperatively to achieve clearance. We continue to believe the transaction will be approved, business divestitures will not be required and we will close in the second half of the year, all completely consistent with our original expectations. Upon close, our #1 priority is to provide even more differentiated value to clients of all shapes, sizes and industries. For example, we've made great progress in identifying ways to further enable the offerings of community-based financial institutions and the variety of customers they serve. We see a number of client and customer advantages which we will further evaluate upon closing to determine the absolute best way to bring these to market. The integration planning teams are working well together across multiple work streams centered on delivering incremental client and shareholder value, ensuring we have the best talent and identifying ways to sustainably exceed our synergy targets of $500 million of recurring annual revenue and $900 million of run rate cost benefits. We have a shared desire to advance the market and to redefine the way in which payment and FinTech services will be delivered. Along those lines, we also announced a commitment to invest an incremental $0.5 billion on solution innovation on top of the significant investments each of our companies make today. We expect this investment to create multiple sources of client and customer value which should lead to even stronger results, none of which has been incorporated in our financial projections. With that, let's review performance against our 2019 key shareholder priorities which are, first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationship with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter, including 5% internal revenue growth, led by 6% internal growth in the Financial segment and 4% in the Payments segment. We saw good performance in the quarter across our recurring revenue businesses, along with some acceleration of license revenue in the Financial segment. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 12% over the prior year through higher revenue growth, better-than-planned adjusted operating margin and some benefit from lower taxes. The change in adjusted operating margin was primarily from a combination of ramping client implementations, carryover from last year's tax reinvestment programs and dilution related to acquisitions and divestitures, all of which Bob will discuss in more detail. These investments are focused on driving additional client value and should contribute to a continuing step up in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years. Free cash flow conversion of 90% was generally consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the full year given the cadence of expected investments throughout 2019. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. As you will recall last quarter, we signed the largest new account processing client in our history, adding New York Community Bank with over $50 billion of assets. We continue to focus on growing our core account processing client base, signing 14 institutions in the quarter, including 6 on our market-leading premier platform. Also during the quarter, Aite Group issued its U.S. core banking system evaluation which named Fiserv as the sole best-in-class provider. This is based on a robust evaluation of all qualified market participants and is primarily based on vendor strength, market reputation and breadth of product portfolio. We are very pleased with this award and recognition. We also signed 6 DNA clients in the quarter, with 4 having assets greater than $1 billion, including a competitive takeaway of Nassau Educators Federal Credit Union with $3.2 billion in assets who selected DNA along with several important surround solutions. We also completed 7 new client implementations in the quarter and expect that total to build throughout the year. Increasing digital engagement with customers remains a top priority for financial institutions. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew nearly 20% in the quarter to just under 8.5 million. Importantly, the average app store rating for this multi-institutional solution, a critical barometer of digital experience, has now achieved an average star rating of 4.7 out of 5. These strong results reflect our commitment to digital differentiation, enhanced user experience and expanded features such as integrated notifications, card controls and enhanced biometrics. We continue to see meaningful opportunities to help clients increase their revenue through expanded debit, credit and network programs. We signed 21 clients in the quarter, including Atlanta Postal Credit Union with over $2.1 billion in assets, which selected both debit and credit card processing to service their more than 100,000 members across the United States. Atlanta Postal Credit Union, who is not a core account processing client, also selected our credit advisory subscription service to provide additional support across their account and fraud management processes. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Building on key force momentum, we continue to see clients select Fiserv as the market continues its move towards meaningful payments innovation. In a competitive process, the top 35 bank selected Dovetail, our leading payment hub technology, to meet their evolving commercial and international business needs. We expect to see payments modernization continue for the next 3 to 5 years and believe our growing position as a front to back payments provider creates opportunities to create unique network value for our clients. In addition to payments, we're seeing growing traction in our commercial digital solutions as banks look to enhance the services to their most important customers. Commercial Center, which we acquired a couple of years ago, has added nearly 50 new institutional clients due to their market-leading functionality and capabilities. In fact, we had 8 clients go live in the first quarter alone and the pipeline remains very strong. Another example of commercial services growth can be seen in our Mobiliti business commercial digital solution. Financial institution clients grew 24% year-over-year, and the number of end business clients utilizing the service was up a very strong 65% over the prior year and 11% sequentially. We expect the digitization of commercial services to drive important value for clients and enhance revenue growth for us. Our enthusiasm and commitment for Zelle continues to expand, not just in terms of our clients, but for the market as a whole. We believe the network benefits of Zelle will enhance the services financial institutions deliver to their customers. First Citizens Bank, with over $35 billion in assets, selected Zelle in a competitive replacement. This replacement decision was driven, in part, by their ability to utilize our value-added Zelle broad and risk management capabilities. We also signed a leading online financial services provider to our turnkey Zelle solution in the quarter. We expect to meaningfully expand our Zelle leadership position this year as the market more fully embraces this important opportunity. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As shared upfront we're pleased with the start of the year, driving results ahead of our internal expectations. Adjusted revenue, which includes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 5% in the quarter to $1.4 billion with internal revenue growth up a strong 5% as well. We saw solid execution across many of our businesses in the quarter, along with some timing benefits of license revenue in the Financial segment. Overall, termination fees in the quarter were essentially flat. First quarter adjusted operating income increased 3% to $457 million and was negatively impacted by the Lending Transaction. Adjusted operating margin was down 60 basis points to 31.9% in the quarter. Margin performance, which is actually ahead of our plan, including more than 60 basis points of pressure from higher client implementation costs in our digital and payment solutions and some carryover of the expenses originated from the 2018 tax reinvestment program. We also had a 20 basis point headwind from acquisitions in the Lending Transaction in the quarter. These results were fully anticipated and incorporated in our adjusted operating margin guidance of at least 50 basis points expansion for the year. Adjusted earnings per share was up 12% to $0.84 compared to the prior year. This strong start positions us well to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue grew 10% in the first quarter to $845 million, which includes the Elan debit processing acquisition. Internal revenue growth was up 4% over the prior year, led by electronic payments, card services and biller solutions. Our segment growth rate was a bit lower in the quarter due primarily to the timing and mix of card services revenue which we expect will reverse later this year. Importantly, debit transaction growth remains strong in the high single digits for the quarter. And we expect the Payments segment internal revenue growth rate to accelerate for the balance of the year. The integration of the Elan debit processing acquisition is progressing very well. In addition to serving clients, we're seeing early traction in revenue synergy opportunities such as ATM Managed Services and Money Pass, our expanded surcharge-free ATM network. Elan's results will be incorporated in our internal revenue growth calculation beginning in November. Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 6% to $287 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points to 34% in the quarter. Segment margin performance was negatively impacted by more than 150 basis points from increased implementations in investment cost, business mix and compression from the Elan acquisition. As the tax reinvestment projects roll off and implementations come online in the second half of the year, we expect segment adjusted operating margin performance to improve. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew nearly 20% in the quarter to just under 8.5 million as consumers continue to reinforce the importance of the mobile channel. In addition, Architect, one of our newer solutions, which delivers a unified experience across our -- all digital channels, continues to gain traction. We have signed nearly 70 clients to this platform since the acquisition. And after achieving the 50% subscriber growth in 2018, we expect to nearly double the number of Architect digital subscribers this year. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, were up 100% versus the prior year quarter. And Zelle transactions alone nearly quadrupled versus last year. We expect to bring a significant number of new Zelle clients live this year and even more acceleration in 2020. We continue to focus on enabling our clients to navigate the evolving payments market. Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was down 3% to $598 million for the quarter due solely to the lending divestiture which anniversaried in March. Internal revenue growth was a very strong 6% in the quarter, led by strength in our core account and item processing businesses, along with the timing benefits to license revenue in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a disproportionately high periodic revenue in last year's Q2, which will provide the basis for a tough comparing in this year's second quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the Financial segment was down slightly to $199 million due to the Lending Transaction. Adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 33.3% due to growth in recurring revenue and the timing benefit of license revenue, offset somewhat by higher product investments. Overall, we're very pleased with the Financial segment performance in the quarter. The adjusted corporate operating loss was in line with our expectations and the prior year at $29 million for the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate was better than expectations at just under 16%, and we had a timing benefit of about $0.02 in the quarter due to some anticipated discrete tax items which favorably impacted our adjusted effective tax rate. And we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year to be between 22% and 23%. Free cash flow was $302 million, down 4% following a very strong Q4 and also reflects the negative net impact of acquisitions and divestitures for the quarter. Free cash flow conversion of 90% was pressured primarily by the timing of working capital expenditures and negative working capital, which includes the timing of commission payments related to a very strong Q4. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our free cash flow conversion to be at least 105% for the year as CapEx normalizes and timing of working capital reverses. We repurchased 1.6 million shares in the quarter, returning $120 million to our shareholders prior to announcing the First Data transaction. We had 392 million shares outstanding with 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at quarter end. And as announced, we have deferred our share repurchase program until the transaction closes. Total debt outstanding as of March 31 was down to $5.9 billion, and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.6x. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned up front, sales momentum has been excellent, and we are well positioned to meet or exceed our sales target for the year. Importantly, next week, we will host a record number of clients and prospects at our annual event, Fiserv Forum, which we expect will create additional opportunities throughout the year. We followed our record fourth quarter sales performance with one of our best first quarter totals ever, which also translated to a 10% increase over last year. We saw strength across a number of areas, including account processing, card solutions, output solutions and Dovetail. Our domestic pipeline is higher than last year, and we are confident we will achieve our sales goals. Integrated sales in the quarter was down slightly after a very strong fourth quarter. And as is typical, we expect integrated sales to build throughout the year and that we will again achieve our full year objective. We continue to demonstrate our strong operational effectiveness muscle as we look to close out a 5-year $250 million program a full year early. Our first quarter results are on track, achieving $12 million of savings across multiple areas against our $50 million target for the full year. Before we wrap, let me provide some perspective on the environment. We've seen a significant amount of M&A this year in both technology providers and financial institutions, which we generally expect will continue. The prevailing themes appear centered on scale, investment capacity and innovation. From our perspective, we believe the First Data combination provides differentiated solutions, investment capacity and necessary scale to partner for the long term across the evolving financial and payments landscape. We're seeing platform investments, digital enablement, security and payments all taking mindshare. Market participants are evolving, competitiveness for core deposits remains very high, and stakes are rising for digitally enabled retail and commercial services. Last, we're seeing a slow but steady number of de novo applications and approval of which we have 1/2 since early 2018 and expect a number of these new institutions to be more technologically savvy than in the past. However, these trends -- overall, these trends remain aligned with our strategic focus and further positions your company for long-term success. As for guidance, we're on track to achieve our financial commitments for the year. We expect our full year internal revenue growth rate to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% with higher growth in the second half of the year. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to increase between 10% and 14% at a range of $3.39 to $3.52 for the year. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, it's important to remind you that we had very high periodic revenue in last year's Q2, which will create a difficult compare this year. As such, we anticipate the second quarter will be the low watermark for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth, with strong acceleration into the back half of the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin for the year to expand by at least 50 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be more than 105%. Lastly, our guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction. We're pleased with our start to the year, delivering strong financial and sales results while investing in the strategic solutions of your company. We are bullish about the significant number of opportunities to deliver client and market differentiation while building meaningful incremental shareholder value through the First Data combination. Lastly, let me thank the 24,000 Fiserv associates around the world who work tirelessly to serve our clients with excellence and purpose each day. You are the great differentiator that has powered us to success for the last 35 years and will move us forward well into the future. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Baird. David Koning : I guess first of all, just you talked a lot a bit about the -- I'm sorry, the Payments segment was a little weaker in Q1. You talked about mix. And I'm just -- and I think you maybe talked about processing days and maybe Easter like there were some things that happened I think across the payments landscape. Is that a little bit what happened and why you think growth will accelerate the rest of the year? Jeffery Yabuki : So from a segment margin standpoint or a growth rate standpoint you're asking? David Koning : Yes, from a growth rate standpoint. Robert Hau : Yes. So it was a little bit lighter than what we've seen over the last few quarters. It came in at about 4%. One of the keys that we pointed out in the opening remarks is that the underlying debit volume was high single digits, so consistent with what we've seen. There was a bit of timing around some payment merchant card fees that we expect to get in the latter part -- or the rest of this year, and so we do think it was largely timing, and it'll come back on a full year basis and provide typical meaningful growth for us on a full year basis. Jeffery Yabuki : And Dave, as you know, you always have the day-to-day comparisons each year and with Easter falling where it did this year versus last, you always have those things. That obviously will work themselves out throughout the year. David Koning : Got you. No, that's good. And then I guess the second thing is, the margins, you did a nice job kind of laying out some of the headwinds that hit Q1. Maybe you could talk about what the underlying growth in Q1 is. And if you expect margins to go up, I think each of the remaining 3 quarters, is that fair to say? Jeffery Yabuki : So Dave, let me start with that and then Bob can certainly add in. I would say that as between the divestitures and the acquisitions that we've laid in, some of the taps-oriented investments, I think Bob indicated in his prepared remarks that it was more than 150 basis points in the Payments segment alone. We had some growth in the Financial segment. So if you think about it in the area of 100-ish basis points, I think that gives you a comparative sense. We also said in our remarks that we had very high periodic revenue last year in Q2. I actually think we'll have a hard time getting over that mountain in Q2, so we'll have a little bit of degradation again and then have a bunch of growth coming in, in the second half of the year when the tax program reinvestments abate, the implementations come online, the investments begin to abate and the periodic revenue is more normalized. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Nice job. Let me just start in terms of feedback from clients now and at least a few months obviously, any incremental color that has given you more conviction or different confidence around the synergy, the revenue synergy on the deal? And then Jeff, the First Data results were strong. I mean was that kind of run rate in your plan as well in terms of just the type of growth? Jeffery Yabuki : So the -- let me take the first question, and we had talked a little bit on our Q4 call about the positive impressions and the positive responses that we were getting from the market, and certainly that's continued and we've been able to begin working together on our integration planning and putting specific energy in both the cost side and on the revenue side. And in fact, on the revenue side, based on a combination of the ideas and the focus that we have or that we built as part of the opposition process, but also in taking in market feedback, we actually have 10 teams of people across both companies focused on more than 40 discrete areas of revenue opportunity, ways to deliver client value that will turn into revenue for us, which is actually broader than we anticipated we would be at the stage. Now clearly, not all 40 of them are going to turn right now, but there's a lot of really interesting ideas that teams are putting together and we'll have plenty to pursue as we get through closing and begin to work together, but it's really been quite positive from that perspective. Darrin Peller : All right. That's helpful. And then just on the First Data side. I mean again the trend seemed sound as well there. Is that in line with what you had expected, I guess? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I think, I mean, Darrin, what I would say is I would point back to the original call that we did in January where we said we don't think the market fully understands and embraces First Data, the performance that Frank and his team have put together. And the fact that this is a good, solid growing business with great market share and great products and great opportunities. So we feel good about those results, and we're excited to get the closing and begin working together. Darrin Peller : Just very quickly, digital banking, in general, I mean, it still seems to be a big driver for you guys. I mean has that still been showing the acceleration, the kind of driver you saw last couple of quarters? Anything changing on the front that you could call out? Or -- I mean to us, it's an area of focus that we think the whole industry is potentially going to show inflection on further. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, and Darrin, obviously, you're a fan of that and you've done a lot of work. I think one of the things that you heard in our prepared comments is often when we talk about digital, we end up talking about retail. And we're seeing just as much focus, frankly, if not more focus, on the business and commercial side of the house. And it's one of the reasons why we're quite excited about Clover and some of the other merchant capabilities within First Data because we think the intersection of those capabilities and digital enablement is -- will create a very attractive commercial and small business solution that will allow banks to -- our client banks to compete in a more fulsome way. So I think you're exactly right. That's going to continue. And I also like the intersection of digital commercial services and payments modernization. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Damian Wille : Guys, this is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. So I guess maybe I'll dig in on DNA. It's good to see that you got 6 new more wins this quarter and obviously last quarter was a big win on the larger asset sized institution. Maybe if you could just kind of profile what the pipeline looks like there and the size of institutions that you're looking at. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, it is -- it continues to be quite strong. We had mentioned in Q4 that we've been slowly and intentionally moving up the ladder of asset size. And so we think once we get New York Community Bank live, that will be a fantastic proof point of not just DNA, but the full differentiated surround suite that we can deliver, whether it is Dovetail, Commercial Center, Mobiliti, all of the other fraud, risk products that go into the solution, we think that will be a strong message. So the pipeline reflects the growing interest. I also talked a little bit in my environmental comments about platform decisions. Clearly, we're seeing the market recognize the need to move to real time or at least consider moving to real time. And when major decisions are being contemplated, we tend to be in the mix. We certainly don't always win, but we're in there, and we're fighting. And one of the things that we talked about today is Aite gave us the best-in-class core provider designation, the only one of any U.S. provider. And again, we think that recognizes the combination of the strength of the company, the strength of the client base and the strength of the platforms. Damian Wille : Okay. And maybe I think I know the answer to this question, but is there any update that you can give us on the approval process from the regulators, specifically on the second request, maybe any color on what they are focused on and just in general the approval process there. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I mean, like I said, like we said in the prepared remarks, we are working cooperatively with the Department of Justice to secure the necessary HSR approval. There has been nothing in the process to date which is inconsistent with our original expectations. We said today we still believe we'll close in the second half of the year. We don't expect any divestitures of our businesses, and we believe we will get through this in a manner again consistent with our original beliefs -- our belief. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : It's good to see the sales momentum continuing on the client side, but maybe you could provide us an update, Jeff, just in terms of where clients' heads are at in terms of overall spending priorities, maybe just talk about whether you're seeing any kind of further acceleration or urgency, especially amongst some of your smaller bank clients. And then maybe on the flip side of things, how are people viewing the BB&T SunTrust merger in terms of the overall backdrop and wanting to accelerate technology spending or maybe put the hold on it? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, sure. Great question, Jim. So I would say from a perspective of the market overall, we're continuing to see a focus in digital security, payments. We're seeing a more holistic view of the implications of broader platform investments, so that's absolutely happening. With the energy on Zelle, that's another proof point around payments modernization. So we've got all of that going on. There's really a fight for deposits, and so even areas such as bill pay which haven't gotten attention over the last number of years, there is an absolute understanding that your primary bill pay account is the one that carries the majority deposits. And so you're seeing new solutions get chosen out of the basket to try to make sure that banks are winning the funding game. And so that's gotten energy and attention, and we think that will absolutely continue to happen. So -- and then also, on the commercial side, just making sure that it's not just retail digital, but commercial digital as well. Now as it relates to BB&T and SunTrust, I mean, we've heard this happen a number of times where large banks have gotten together and said, \"We need scale. We need the capacity to invest.\" And then that is sending the message across the landscape. Most of that gets allocated not into the back office, but into the front office and to client-facing solutions, again, digital, payments and some of the Platform Solutions. Also, the whole area risk and fraud continues to be important as fraudsters have had to go -- learn to go to different places. I think that's out there. And then the last thing I would throw out is, we're starting to see a little bit of a crack in contactless. And so we have some level of comfort that -- or confidence that we'll start to see contactless start to rise. We think the introduction in the New York subways is important. So the more acceptance that we see at that level, the more we think that will drive. In contactless, the idea absolutely links quite beautifully into digital and digital enablement. James Schneider : That's helpful color. And then maybe as a follow-up, clearly, since you announced your combination with First Data, we've also seen the announced proposed transaction between FIs and WorldPay. Can you maybe comment on how, if at all, that's changed your view of the competitive landscape and how difficult or easy it will be to penetrate your bank clients with additional cross-sell services going forward? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So listen, I think the real point here is that the markets are changing and they're changing fast, and the providers that don't change run the risk of having their relevance diminish over time. We believe that the combination with First Data gives us a far broader solution set than any other combination in the industry could have created because First Data is not just a merchant acquirer, but they are a -- the global leader in merchant acquiring, they are the global leader in issuer processing, and they have an incredible bench of data risk solutions, fraud solutions. There hasn't been a payment conversation in the last 50 years that hasn't included First Data somewhere in that combination. So we are quite excited about the combination and what it brings, but we also recognize that there is a need to have more of this type of combination happen over time. Our goal was to leave -- to lead that change, and we absolutely believe we've done that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Competitive question. There's more consolidation going on in the smaller scale in the biller direct business. I think the #3 share looking to buy the #2 share. How do you guys look at that? Does that change the competitive dynamic? Or is it something that you've kind of seen coming for a while? Any update on that front? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean that, to your point, that really is not -- I mean there's been lots of fintech -- well-funded fintech players trying to grab that space in the on-demand space where we compete. We see much more focus from those kinds of players. It really just validates the opportunity that we see to bring it all together to get kind of more robust forms of distribution out there. So not just the direct channel, but a bank channel, an ISB channel which we think are quite important from those perspectives and then of course, just continuing to build out the e-commerce capabilities. We think that, that combination, the leadership positions that we both bring upon closing, will allow us to do more than anyone else. Brett Huff : That's great. And another one, I recall that several years ago, you guys talked about a launch of a combined payment product. I think it was -- was it Fiserv NOW? Jeffery Yabuki : NOW network, yes. Brett Huff : How does that fit in with the potential changes that may come from the First Data deal? Was that kind of a precursor of thinking about greater -- dreaming a bigger dream that you might combine the kind of things you can do with Fiserv? Or how does that fit into the new product portfolio? Jeffery Yabuki : Thank you. And Brett, I like the way you said dreaming a bigger dream. That, to some extent, encapsulates -- the purpose of the NOW network was really to function a little bit like a super gateway. And again, we think that what we didn't have the access to was really at scale direct down to the merchant. We have a lot of the back office, a lot of the DDA connectivity. And so the opportunity -- there are any number of the 40 opportunities that have to do with how do you think about the movement of money in a real-time ecosystem and now, we think we'll be a big part of the ultimate solution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : Jeff, can you maybe spot check on the temperature of your financial institution clients in terms of how your conversations are going with them and how they're generally dealing with economic outgrowth for the, let's call it, next 12 to 18 months? We heard one of your competitors earlier today talk about optimism some at Fiserv showing as far as the outlook for the next 12, call it 12, 18 months. I'll just barely optimistic about budgets and spending on technology, really about growth. I just want to see if you could talk to us a little bit about that. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I -- we're obviously in lots of conversations and we're going to have an opportunity next week to talk with a record number of clients and prospects at our annual Fiserv Forum event so we'll certainly grab more feedback. But the feedback that we're getting is, there is opportunity out in the market. There is some belief that the beauty of the credit cycle probably will start to feel pressure at some point, but that is offset by this real focus on deposits, focus on digital, the focus on Commercial lending. So I would say it's a pretty good time. I actually feel better now than I did even when we gave guidance and Q4 results back in February, so I'm feeling like the trend is in the right direction. We are seeing a fair amount of M&A as you can see every day, but I also like the fact that we have new de novos. For the larger clients, the larger institutions and the larger -- and not just the financial institutions, but merchants as well, I think there's still a belief that the economy is in good shape. The larger institutions are putting more and more money into digital experience and so that connects quite well with our strategies, especially when you think about money movement. So it is a good time right now. Jeffrey Cantwell : Appreciate it. And then just as a related one. I know there's a lot of puts and takes and that it's early days, but I'd just like to hear how some of that, call it, cautious optimism could potentially translate into your sustaining 5% top line growth next year might seem like a low bargain than what First Data is doing this quarter. So I would just appreciate any comments or context that you can give us there. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. I mean I would say that all of the context that we've talked about in the market, all of the statistical backup that we try to give in the quarters is all about linking back to our strategy of sustainably increasing our high-quality revenue growth, and turning that into free cash flow and then allocating it to investors to build -- or shareholders to build -- I'm sorry, allocating it to build shareholder value. So from that perspective, that continues. I think we had about 70 basis points of lift last year. I think our trailing growth rate has been hovering in this 4.5% to 5% level, 5% again this quarter and our guidance for the year is 4.5% to 5%. And assuming that we do that, we would expect to have -- and we're not giving guidance, Bob, we're not giving guidance, but we would expect to see a step up in our internal revenue growth rate next year as well. And that is part of our thinking and that is all standalone Fiserv. When you layer on First Data, and to your point, they certainly had good performance in the quarter, but when you layer on the synergy opportunities along with that, along with the growth that we've had, we do expect to have a stepped-up internal revenue growth rate, generate more free cash flow and allocate that to shareholders to build value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen and Company. Allison Jordan : This is Allison Jordan in for George. Just 1 quick question from me. I was hoping you could provide an update and a little more color on client discussions as the First Data deal is being digested and really just your confidence level in renewing some of the larger partnerships that First Data has in place today. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So again, it's important to note that we continue to operate as separate companies, and we'll do that until close. But the feedback that we've heard is that First Data clients feel as good about this as Fiserv clients do. And we have every reason to believe that, that will actually create more incremental value, not less, in all sized clients of First Data, and certainly our objective is to make that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Maybe I could dovetail on that last one and put a finer point on it with respect to one of First Data largest partners and also I believe one of Fiserv's largest partners as well in Bank of America. There's been a lot of conservation around the renewal of the JV there. And while probably more appropriate question for First Data's management, I'm going to ask you guys if there's any discussion or any incremental ways to think about it? And maybe 1 tact to take is just given that you have your own relationship with them, but you're still 2 distinct companies, is there any involvement or any kind of back-and-forth even at a high level with respect to that particular relationship? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Matt, again, as you know, we'll continue to operate as separate companies until closing, but to your point, we have a very long-term and important relationship with Bank of America. First Data has a very active relationship with the bank. And together, we have an even larger, more important relationship and a long history of being an important partner with Bank of America, and we fully expect that, that's going to continue for many years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Drew Kootman : This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. I was wondering if you could touch on, just looking at longer-term margins, just touching on some of the leverage you guys have to keep the expansion going. Robert Hau : Yes, Drew, it's Bob. Ultimately, we pointed out during the first quarter in our prepared remarks here that we've got some headwinds in the current quarter and we saw some last year from the tax reinvestment. So these are discretionary investments we're making that were significant, more significant last year really in the second half of the year. We've got some trailing off of that in the first half of this year. The acquisition anniversarying the Lending Transaction in first quarter and the Elan transaction that will anniversary in November, all of those combined to give us an opportunity for a nice lift as we progress really into the second half. That tax reinvestment is a pretty meaningful change that you'll see in the second half of the year where we spent an order of magnitude of about $25 million or so second half of last year. We've got some trailing of that in the first half that will dwindle down. So you'll see some meaningful margin improvement that gives us that confidence of delivering at least 50 basis points margin expansion for the full year. And going forward, our continued commitment to grow top line, getting to 4.5% to 5% this year, so upwards of 50 basis points revenue growth after 70 basis points revenue growth last year, we're very focused on high-quality recurring revenue growth. That means good margin and helps us deliver that 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement over multiple years into the future. Jeffery Yabuki : I would add, if you take a step back and kind of think about the multiyear margin trend, one of the things, and we pay a lot of attention to this, we don't see anything systemic at all. We continue to deliver really strong operational effectiveness growth -- sorry, operational effectiveness results, continue to grow recurring revenue. One of the things that does happen when you are growing your recurring revenue up, especially around new products, that revenue tends to come on at lower margin and then it builds in over scale. There are 2 other things that if you again on that step back, if you think about the business more year-over-year, if you think about the combination of the lending divestiture last year and the acquisitions that we've done over the last 12 to 18 months, that's somewhere in the area of -- in fact, it's a little bit more than 100 basis points -- in the net effect on margin, and then the tax reinvestment program that we've talked about is in the neighborhood of, I don't know, 40-ish basis points. So those 2 things we've had to consume over the last 18 months, we'll wrap through it this year. But when you combine that kind of unusual set of items, along with the growth that we're getting, the operational effectiveness and the scaling of these new solutions, we feel really good about the underlying performance of the margins given that I think last year even through all of this, margins were down kind of minimally 30 basis points or so. And that means the underlying margin is actually growing at a -- quite a healthy clip. Drew Kootman : Great. And then just a quick one on Zelle, I know you mentioned a couple of big wins recently. How does the pipeline look for that? Jeffery Yabuki : Fantastic. I mean the pipeline in terms of the number of institutions, the pipeline has never been stronger. We expect to, again, assuming that there are not systemic constraints, we will bring multiples of the number of clients that we had live at the end of 2018, we'll bring them up this year and we think it will even be higher next year. So we're feeling really good about Zelle and where it's going. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I had just 2 clarifications probably for Bob, just on financial, maybe you can help us quantify the impact of those license sales. It sounds like they boosted a little bit. So I just want to make sure we have that and maybe what that impact rolls through to the second quarter and throughout the year for license sales. And then secondly, on payments, the timing of card services, not exactly sure what that is and why that necessarily would -- picks up in the back half of the year because it sounds like that was down a little bit but does get back to the back half of the year. Robert Hau : Sure. The financial margin, we're up 50 basis points overall for the quarter. We did see, as you point out, some benefit of recurring the periodic revenue. License revenue was up a little bit. That was actually offset by some of the product implementation investments that we've talked about overall. So those 2 really are canceling out each other and giving us a nice underlying 50 basis point improvement on a 6% top line revenue growth. In terms of the payments, the point we tried to make on the card services merchant fees, there's some timing of those, those come in periodically so there can be some lumpiness to that. It's not based on underlying transactions. We made the point that the underlying transactions were up high single digits again this quarter, and we've seen the Payments segment order of magnitude about 5% every quarter, and it came in at 4% this year -- this quarter, that will turn for the balance of the year and we'll see good overall internal revenue growth of Payments segment on a full year basis. Bryan Keane : Got it. Helpful. And just on financial, I think you gave it to me on the margin side. What about on the revenue side, the boost that license sales or periodic revenue had in the quarter? Robert Hau : Yes, it was overall kind of low single-digit millions -- high single-digit millions, $5 million, $6 million. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, the emphasis, of course, appropriately is on community financial institutions and even as you moved up markets, just traditional banks, I guess, and generally investing in digitization and all the things they need to do perhaps a little belatedly to stay competitive. But how would you -- how do you position Fiserv especially as you combine with First Data to address syntax in particular? Is there a plan by which your technology can perhaps begin to make some inroads there? Or how do you balance, I guess, the existing constituency with opportunities with some of the challenger banks and new players in the market? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. I mean that's a great question. I think the -- and the question around -- I don't know if this is specifically, Andrew, around community-based institutions, but I think, overall, there will end up being, over time, a cooperative relationship between providers of financial services, whether they be small organizations or very large, a small subsegment of the fintech community which delivers product that needs to get integrated back through, and companies like us. And in some cases, we will create solutions that don't require a fintech. But in some cases, fintechs will build stuff that clients will want and we'll integrate it, and we do that today all the time. So I do see it being a cooperative system. I don't see it being an either-or. I think as you start to get into the more important solutions around money movement, around real fully enabled digital, that's a much longer pot for fintech. And I think that we will continue to invest, we'll continue to create unique and differentiated functionality that will help all sized financial institutions and, frankly, all sized merchants win over the longer haul. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That's helpful. And then when you talk about Commercial Solutions, just to be clear because I want to understand how you're viewing it, are you talking specifically about SMB acquiring and Clover and software and kind of all the things that First Data is addressing today? Or are you contemplating an expanded suite of Commercial Solutions? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, so today, today, if you think about our Commercial Center solution, we're enabling some of the largest banks in the U.S. to serve very large sophisticated commercial clients. And if you think about our Mobiliti Business solution, we're digitally enabling all sized cash management. So whether they'd be SMBs or up into the kind of the mid-tier, we have the solutions that go across the entire ecosystem. So we see opportunities, whether it be in Clover, think about it as bank merchant, whether it be in ISV or whether it'd be in the largest global e-com provider to create a new ecosystem that creates very unique value for the industry participants. And so we're quite excited about that opportunity. The one that we talk about the most because it's the nearest in is clearly back merchants. So how do we enable technologies such as Clover to be distributed either digitally or through the physical network into our clients. And integrating them into Cash Management and other kinds of solution. So -- but we do see that broad view into the ecosystem and some of the 40 work streams that we talked about that are focused on driving revenue are touching those kinds of opportunities. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : A question for you, Jeff, and then one for you, Bob. Jeff, I'm assuming the conversations you're having as it relates to your combination with First Data, with big banks and community banks is probably a little bit different. And I'm wondering, as you look at community financial institutions and then conversations you've had with them, what do they see as a positive about this merger? And are there any -- do they have any concerns because of the merger? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, it's interesting. The substantial majority of community-based financial institutions don't view the merchant relationship as wholly integral to how they serve the market. Part of it is because it's -- it is quite a fragmented market. Part of it is that they've got other things to do. And so the opportunity for us to bring the technology platforms together once we're closed and working is something that the institutions very quickly see how that could be valuable. And are quite excited about the different things that can be done thinking about the data that's in the merchant system and the data that's in the core system and the digital enablement, kind of digital solutions, commercial cash management real time, alerts and notifications. I mean it kind of goes on and on. So literally, the banks, the bankers, they'll sit and talk about it quite excitedly for a reasonable period of time. And then what they say is, well, let's make sure you do this and let's make sure you stay focused on what you've always been focused on. And so I don't see it as being kind of negative or on the other side of that positive point. I see it saying, I see the institutions wanting the confidence that they can rely on us to do both. And obviously, we would not have done this if we did not think we could do both. Kartik Mehta : And then, Bob, just a clarification, what are the headwinds in revenue that you're anticipating in the second quarter because of periodic revenue? Robert Hau : Yes, so if you recall, second quarter of last year, we had a benefit, so we had significant internal revenue growth in the second quarter, driven from the timing of license revenue partially. And so what you're seeing is that the reverse timing effect where Q1 last year saw some license revenue slide into Q2, we actually saw some benefit of Q3 pooling into Q2. And then this year, we saw that pick up in Q1 coming out of Q2. And so kind of a dual effect of that taking place in the second quarter. Kartik Mehta : So from a dollar standpoint, absolute dollar standpoint, Bob, are you able to give a range of what you expect to be the headwind in the second -- this year's second quarter? Robert Hau : Yes, the one thing I'd point to you is Q2 of last year, we talked about the timing benefits of that license revenue being about midteens impact. Jeffery Yabuki : Midteens. Robert Hau : Millions, sorry. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Kartik. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to continuing discussions. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call -- to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a good evening.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins, following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Tiffany Willis : Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and the anticipated combinations with First Data, including expected benefits, financial projections, synergies, financing and timing of and the ability to complete the transaction. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons. As a reminder, the prior year's year-to-date adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the sale of a majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which closed in March 2018. And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Tiffany, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter against our most difficult comparison of the year. We delivered better-than-anticipated results in the quarter and the first half, and are well on our way to meet our full year financial targets. Now, before we talk about the financial results, let me provide a brief update on the First Data transaction. We've received all required regulatory approvals and plan to close the transaction on July 29, well within our original expectations of closing in the second half of the year. As anticipated, we received all of our approvals without any conditions. We continue to prepare for day one and are focused on moving from integration planning to actual integration. We've announced a number of our senior leadership roles and the entire organization is ready to kick off the new Fiserv. Clients and prospects are excited about the opportunities they see for us to deliver differentiated value and build their businesses in new and unique ways. We've been working on meaningful incremental growth opportunities such as bank merchant, credit solutions, biller services, network and international. We believe that integrating the solutions of our two leading companies will create incremental opportunities for clients to better serve their customers, generate additional revenue, operate more efficiently and better manage risk. Our client first focus should translate to more revenue for Fiserv and may ultimately allow us to exceed our $500 million revenue synergy target. We've made strong progress on cost synergy planning with a focus on delivering more efficiently for clients and with higher quality. Our teams are focused on the absolute dollar value of the opportunities as well as increasing the pace and timing of those savings. Upon closing, we will fully deploy our teams with a targeted outcome of exceeding the $900 million target. One of the unique benefits of this transaction is our commitment to increase organic solution investment by $0.5 billion over the next five years. We are acutely aware of the potential competitive advantages to making the right investments in this time of transformational market change. We're in the early stages of scoping the first round of these investments, which we believe will ultimately further accelerate growth and profitability. We recently raised funds to refinance First Data's debt in a more favorable interest rate environment than we anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. At today's rates, this translates to additional annual savings of approximately $120 million ahead of our original expectations. All of this taken together reinforces our belief that the combination will produce more than 20% accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months, and more than 40% accretion at the full synergy run rate. We're thrilled to be on the precipice of closing this transaction and moving forward together. We're even more convinced that this transformative combination will extend leadership and value for clients, create important opportunities for associates and deliver above-market returns for shareholders for many years to come. Now, back to the financial results. Internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter and adjusted earnings-per-share growth was 9%, both against a very difficult prior year compare. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. Momentum remains strong as sales increased 17% in the quarter and is up 14% through June 30. We fully expect to achieve our sales objectives for the year. We held our annual client conference Forum 2019 in May, posting over 6,000 professionals at keynote addresses, solution showcases, thought leadership sessions and numerous client networking events. We also had nearly 400 prospects in attendance and lead generation on site was nearly double the total contract value compared to last year. We believe Forum is becoming the must-attend client event of the year. With that, let's review performance against our 2019 key shareholder priorities, which are, first, continue to build high quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. As mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter's performance and strong position exiting the first half of the year. Company internal revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, including 5% growth in the Payments segment and was up 2% in the Financial segment even in the face of a very difficult compare. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% in the quarter and 11% year to date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was flat to the prior year, which was better than our expectations given the license revenue grow over. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 50 basis points sequentially as we began to see the early signs of the tax reinvestment abating, continued scale benefits of our high-quality recurring revenue and positive impact of our operational effectiveness program. Free cash flow -- free cash flow through June 30 was up a very strong 23% to $602 million and our free cash flow conversion was 91%. Our second priority to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. The demand for Fiserv account processing solutions continue to be strong with 13 wins in the quarter, six on D&A, which included a strong showing with larger credit unions. For example, world [Phonetic] credit union with $1.6 billion in assets, expanded their Fiserv relationship by selecting D&A and other complementary solutions, including teller capture, item processing and Nautilus to support their growing commercial and mortgage portfolios. In addition, highway credit union with over $1 billion in assets and velocity credit union with over $800 million in assets, both selected D&A in the quarter to utilize our modern and open technology platform to enhance their members experiences. Card solutions continued their strong sales, signing First Mid Bank & Trust with $3.5 billion in assets to our debit processing solution in the quarter. We also added Alabama Credit Union with nearly $1 billion in assets, who selected a full suite of debit, credit and card production services to facilitate a more integrated and enhanced member experience. JD Bank with more than $800 million in assets enhanced their Fiserv relationship by selecting ATM Managed Services. One of our newest card capabilities coming from the Elan acquisition. This service will allow JD Bank to update their ATM fleet to the forefront of upcoming software and compliance mandates and better serve their customers. We've signed seven clients for ATM Managed Services and have added more than 250 institutions to the pipeline since the transaction closed last October. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Payments modernization continues to be top of mind for progressive financial institutions, which translated to five Dovetail payment hub decisions in the quarter, including Sterling National Bank for nearly $30 billion of assets. We also signed Eastern Bank, which is one of the largest and oldest mutual banks in the country, with over $11 billion in assets and locations, serving communities in Eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We signed a very large bank in the Middle East, which selected Dovetail to advance their capabilities through a single platform to process payments transactions globally. Lastly, First National Bank of Pennsylvania, with nearly $34 billion in assets chose our Dovetail payments platform along with our Immediate Funds solution as another way to drive value to their customers by supporting demand for real-time access to funds and improving the overall deposit experience. We remain bullish about the strength and leadership of our full complement of end to end payments capabilities, both now and into the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As Jeff mentioned, we feel good about our performance for the first half of the year and are in a strong position to achieve our full-year goals. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $1.5 billion in the quarter and 6% to $2.9 billion year-to-date as a result of growth in high quality recurring revenue and new revenue from the Elan acquisition. These quarterly results were particularly encouraging, given the significant prior year license revenue compare. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year to date, led by strong performance across our card services, electronic payments, output solutions and account processing businesses. Foreign currency negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 20 basis points in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $470 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $927 million through June 30. Our year-to-date results include a headwind from our lending transaction that closed in Q1 of last year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat at 32.4%, which is better than our internal expectations. The expected the decline in license revenue, the Elan acquisition and continued investments that we described in Q1 had a collective 90 basis point headwind on adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin improved 50 basis points on stronger operating performance and lower investments. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points to 32.1% compared to last year and was better than our internal expectations for the period. The first-half results include headwinds of more than 80 basis points, including more than 50 basis points from investments and 30 basis points from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The investments in client implementations and the tax reinvestment carryover expense, which we described during our first quarter earnings call, began to abate this quarter and will further moderate in the second half of the year. The acquisition impact will anniversary in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% to $0.82 in the quarter and increased 11% to $1.66 year to date, positioning us well to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. The Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 11% to $855 million in the quarter and 10% to $1.7 billion year to date. Internal revenue growth increased sequentially 120 basis points to 5% in the quarter and is up 4% year to date, led primarily by our card services, electronic payments and Output Solutions businesses. Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 12% to $303 million in the quarter and 9% to $590 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points sequentially to 35.4% in the quarter and increased 40 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to continued high quality revenue growth and gains in productivity, partially offset by a 60 basis point negative impact from acquisitions. Adjusted operating margin for the first six months of the year was down 50 basis points to 34.7%, which includes pressure from the Elan transaction and the impact of first half investments which will subside in the second half of the year. Debit transactions grew high-single digits in both the quarter and year to date. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 16% in the quarter to nearly 9 million as consumers continued to embrace digital banking services. We also saw mobility business clients increase 2% as commercial customers also migrate to digital experiences. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle were up 120% in the quarter, and grew 21% sequentially. Zelle transactions again nearly quadrupled in the quarter and the number of live clients more than doubled sequentially. We also signed nearly 60 clients in the quarter and remain enthusiastic about the growth prospects for Zelle and the positive impact it should have on the banking system. For the financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 2% to $604 million for the quarter and for the year to date was generally consistent with last year at $1.2 billion, which includes the Lending Transaction impact which anniversaried at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 4% year to date, led by our account and item processing businesses. These results include the very difficult license revenue compare in the quarter, which shows the benefits of underlying processing revenue growth. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 1% to $203 million in the quarter and for the first six months was consistent with prior year at $402 million. Adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points to 33.7% in the quarter primarily due to the tough compare from prior year's strong license revenue. Adjusted operating margin through June 30 was up 10 basis points to 33.5% due to growth in revenue -- growth in recurring revenue and solid operational execution, partially offset by product investments and the difficult compare in the license revenue. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $36 million for the quarter and $65 million year to date, which is in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and 18.8% for the first half of the year. We've seen some additional tax benefits in the first half of the year and accordingly now expect our full year tax rate to bias toward the lower end of our adjusted effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 23%. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and was up 23% to $602 million through June 30, an increase of more than $100 million versus the prior year. Fee cash flow conversion was 91% for the first half of the year, which was pressured a bit by tax payments, along with the timing of capital expenditures, which were planned a bit heavier in the first half of the year. We continue to expect our free cash flow conversion to be at least 105% for the year. As you know, our share repurchase program remains deferred in conjunction with the First Data transaction. There were 393 million shares outstanding and 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at June 30. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised the funds to refinance First Data's debt with $12 billion in senior notes in June and July across multiple currencies. We raised $9 billion of US dollar debt, $1.7 billion in euro-denominated notes and $1.3 billion in sterling-denominated notes. These senior notes have an average tenure of 11.6 years. Including the impact of hedges, the combination of the public debt, along with $5 billion term loan leads to combined interest rate of 3.47%, which is roughly $120 million lower than the expected annual interest cost at the time of the First Data transaction announcement. Total debt outstanding as of June 30 was $13.8 billion, which includes the proceeds from the US dollar portion of the debt raise. The additional $3 billion raised in Europe was not completed until July 1. Upon closing, we expect 75% of our debt to be fixed. We had a pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times after netting the proceeds received in June against our total debt balance. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Bob. Sales performance was up a strong 17% in the quarter and is up 14% year to date. We saw solid performance in several areas, including our account processing businesses, card solutions and Dovetail. Sales performance has been increasing significantly, up 22% over the last nine months, which we believe is especially meaningful in light of the First Data transaction. The domestic pipeline also remains strong and up 3% in the quarter and 11% sequentially. Integrated sales was up 22% in the quarter and is up 4% in the first half of the year, reflecting the compelling Fiserv integrated value proposition. We continue to demonstrate our operational effectiveness competency, achieving $13 million of benefits in the quarter and $25 million of savings year-to-date driven largely by procurement and labor initiatives. We are on track to meet our $50 million target and close out our five year $250 million program, a full year early. As per guidance, we're on track to achieve our full year financial commitments, buoyed by a stronger than anticipated first half of the year. We continue to expect our full year internal revenue growth rate to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% and that second half growth will be moderately higher than the first. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to increase between 10% and 14% in a range of $3.39 to $3.52 for the year with a bias at or above the midpoint of the range. We also expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points for the year and that free cash flow conversion will be more than a 105%. Lastly, as a reminder, our 2019 guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction, which we expect will close Monday. However, we will provide updated guidance for the combined company, along with a very preliminary look into 2020 when we convene our third quarter call. We also expect to provide historical financial information in mid-September, using our go-forward accounting treatment for the combined company. For modeling it close, we suggest you combine the guidance provided by both Fiserv and First Data in today's earnings releases and incorporate adjustments such as stock-based compensation for First Data, which as you know, we include in our numbers, lower interest expense and also include a modest estimate for synergy benefits for the last five months of the year. We expect synergies to ramp through the balance of 2019 and deliver a much larger P&L impact next year. For Fiserv historians you may know that on July 31, we will celebrate our 35 anniversary. We're fortunate to have been part of the proud history of Fiserv and are even more excited for what we believe will be an amazing next chapter for the Company. The opportunity to partner with our clients to help them serve their customers is a compelling reason to exist. And at the same time, we've created meaningful value for shareholders, delivering a more than 33,000% return since going public in 1986 and as good as that sounds, we know our success is a result of the thousands of associates who have contributed to Fiserv over the years, along with the more than 24,000 current associates who come to work each day singularly focused on delivering excellence to clients. We can't wait for the next 35 years to start. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good evening guys. And great to be joining your call for the first time. I wanted to ask a question about the rollout of contact list in the US. It looks, I guess, tentatively like that might actually be coming. Can you just comment on how your bank customers are thinking about the rollout of contactless, meaning do they have specific plans for issuing contactless cards and on what timeline and then how do you expect that to impact your business over the next six to 12 months? Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. Thanks, Lisa and great to have you. We are actually seeing -- starting to see an uptick in demand for contactless or dual interface. We had not planned very much for that in our numbers in 2019, thinking that we would start to see that tick up in 2020 and 2021. And having contactless available in places like the New York subway, we think is helping that and obviously, the brands are focused on that. So we issue about 100 million or so payments cards -- produced 100 million or so payment cards per year. We think that could actually be impactful. We don't see it having a significant impact in 2019, but we're optimistic that we'll see that roll in, certainly in 2020 and 2021 as we see that move throughout the system. The other thing that we're seeing just as interestingly is we also do a fair amount around the prepaid providers and we're seeing the prepaid providers start to issue EMV and we believe that a number of them will actually jump straight to contactless. So we're feeling good about that. We like that as a tailwind and we'll -- we'll continue to monitor that. Lisa Ellis : All right. Terrific. Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Lisa Ellis : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is coming from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. David Koning : Yeah, hey, guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hey, Dave. David Koning : Thanks. Nice job. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. David Koning : So, I mean as a historian looking back at the last 10 years, it seems like both you and First Data are putting up some of the best core underlying growth that you have. And I'm wondering a lot of it seems company specific, both of you are doing well in the market, signing well, how much of it's just the backdrop getting better and maybe what is driving that right now. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, thanks, Dave. I mean we're -- obviously we are both continuing to run our companies separately and we'll continue to do that until -- until Monday morning or we expect to continue to do that until Monday morning. I mean, we know that First Data has been making a number of investments both inside the US and outside the US. We're just as pleased as everyone else to see GBS North America post a nice 5% number and the rest of the world is looking quite strong and I think that's just a matter of seeing the cumulative effect of the work that Frank and his team have done. And it's one of the things that we talk about, as you know, Dave, we really thought that there was a mismatch between the work that the team had been doing and the way that investors have been looking at that. So from that perspective, we see that coming together and we believe that as you put us and them into a single integrated company, focused on driving innovation and excellence for clients, that will drive incremental growth to the extent of the -- at least $500 million of synergies, and hopefully more. And then -- and then you're seeing on our side just the continuing aggregate effect of bringing on high quality revenue and then having some nice successes in the sales area, whether it be D&A, architect card and then the entire digital ecosystem. So Mobiliti continues to do well, and we talked about Zelle. We're seeing real momentum in Zelle and we're excited about that and we believe that will continue for the next -- probably for the next six to eight quarters. David Koning : Okay, great. And just -- and just one, I guess, follow-up. This is kind of just a financial question, but included in the guidance for stand-alone Fiserv, are you including that month of $12 billion or so of extra debt or is that almost like you're not including that in the $3.39 to $3.52 guidance? Robert W. Hau: Yeah, Dave we are not including that. That's a transaction-related cost that you will see that adjusted out of the non-GAAP results. David Koning : Got you. Great. Well, thanks guys. Nice job. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave. Operator : The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jim Schneider : Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and thanks for taking my question. I guess if you, I mean Jeff you articulated several areas on the revenue synergy side. Most of which you talked about before, but in the time you've had to contemplate the transaction over the last six months, which is maybe one or two revenue synergy items that you are most incremental excited about or that you didn't really anticipate before, I think international, you mentioned is one, which I don't recall you're talking about before, any color on that would be helpful. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. Thanks, Jim. We have been very pleased with the work that the teams have done in identifying a large categories of synergies, everything from expanding the way technology such as point of sale lending will look, focused on how do we help merchants get their money faster, the use of data in terms of thinking about how to -- how to make better -- better decisions around fraud and the like. And then outside the US, we -- one of the things that because we were pretty small in Fiserv outside the US and First Data is much larger, we've been able to take a number of the solutions that we have and move them through the -- sorry not move them through, but look at how do we move them through the First Data distribution system or the First Data network outside the US. So we think that's going to be interesting and also looking at where we have some larger clients where First Data may not trying to leverage those kinds of relationships. So I don't see us creating a lot of new innovation in terms of putting the international businesses together per se in the base business, but we do see interesting ways that we'll invest there in the future. Jim Schneider : That's helpful, thanks. And then maybe sort of a macro comment in terms of your bank clients and what they're telling you right now. Just wondering if the A, the change in the interest rate environment and the reversal there and or B, any change in the M&A environment is impacting their spending plans as you see it heading into the back half of this year and 2020? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. And it's a good question, Jim. I mean we obviously know banks are not excited about the fact that the fed has changed their stance on interest rates. I think it was a little bit of a foregone conclusion or has been at least for the last quarter or so. That said, we are not seeing any change in the demand structure for the institutions that we're serving and that's showing up both in terms of -- of the -- the large event Forum that we hosted back in May, we can see it in our pipeline. And then the manifestation of course in sales and the fact that we're going to -- we believe that we will achieve our full year objectives. So that's all to say that the need to spend money on technology is not changing. You can see that in how the large banks talked in their -- in their calls and we see it and we continue to see money shifting from supporting legacy technologies to trying to do some of the newer call them digital based or front-end kinds of experiences. So right now for what we can see, we continue to feel like the spending environment remains consistent for now. We're obviously watching it closely and so that, that looks in good shape. And then on the M&A front, we continue to see, generally the same amount of activity as when rates come down a little bit, you see banks looking more for scale and that's certainly happening. Jim Schneider : Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hey, Darren. Darrin Peller : Congrats on the approvals on the deal closing, first of all, but like you just alluded to the strong growth at First Data, especially in the merchant acquiring side and again I touched on this last quarter, but are these trends the type of growth rates you guys anticipated in your deal accretion and pro forma run rate, are they coming in better than you thought? And then just while I'm on the topic of First Data, is there anything you can update around the JV relationship with BAM just given how much noise there has been in the market around it? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure, sure. So I would say that when we put our original models together and thought about it, I don't know that we were deeply focused on what would be happening in 2019. It was our belief that First Data had been doing things, both organically and through the allocation of capital that would, that would show up. And then we didn't believe that that investors were giving First Data all the due that they should. And I think we're seeing that manifest now, and we're hopeful and strategically focused on making sure that we make the right decisions, so that will continue. So we -- we feel -- I would say that we feel quite good about the performance that we've seen to date, as well as the guidance for the remainder of the year. As it relates to the JV, I mean obviously we've had lots and lots of questions about the JV, which expires next June. Both Fiserv and First Data have long-term multi-solution relationships with Bank -- with Bank of America and we have every reason to believe that's going to continue. And we know that First Data and Bank of America are continuing to work on a plan that makes sense. What I can say is, during the diligence process, we put a lot of time into understanding all of the outcomes or the likely outcomes at least that we expected could come through the JV. And since that point, we've continued to make sure that we're working with the bank to understand, what's going on and we're quite comfortable with all of the different scenarios. And what I can't say, and I think this is really important is that, currently we don't anticipate a financial outcome that creates any meaningful negative impact to First Data's earnings and free cash flow for at least the next three to five years. And there are actually some scenarios in which a structural change could be accretive to the numbers once you get past that point in the future. So from that standpoint, we feel pretty good about that. From a timing perspective, we do expect this issue to be better understood in the third quarter. So we think that the parties are coming together to create a situation that makes sense. I would also say, very importantly, that the Bank of America JV, the different outcomes that we can see the scenarios are fully factored into our transaction accretion estimates, which as you know is 20% to adjusted EPS in year one, and 40% at the full run rate. So, Darren. We think that we've done the work, we think we understand the risks, the pluses and the minuses and we just don't see it having a meaningful negative impact, post closing. Darrin Peller : That's really helpful, Jeff. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up is just one of the exciting parts of these synergies we are hoping for is that Clover would be cross-sold through the banks pretty quickly, given I think sort of the cloud-based approach where you guys manage the -- banks help manage the bank's websites. And just curious if you still think that can happen soon in terms of maybe even second half '19 where Clover starts to be distributed in the near term? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. And, Darren. We are -- we said at the time and our planning teams have been working well together on the idea of bank merchant. I would say we are actually a bit more bullish today even and we were pretty bullish then, but we're even more bullish today. And it's really on two vectors. The first one is the traditional in branch enablement of Clover and then we're also doing some really interesting things on the digital enablement front and we fully expect that after we close on July 29 that we will be in the market and see proof points come in the second half of the year, about the power of the combination. In terms of providing value to the merchant customers of the banks. Darrin Peller : Okay, that's great. Thanks guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Darren. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Darren. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. Brett Huff : Good afternoon, guys and congrats on getting closer on the deal. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Brett. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Brett. Brett Huff : Question on the mix of front and back office tech spending, we kind of heard over the last 18 months, I think you guys have seen this too. Folks, certainly not ignoring the back office and trying to untangle the spaghetti there, but definitely shifting more toward switching this on-boarding on the front, you mentioned a little bit about that, could you illuminate [Phonetic] any acceleration on that side? Or any changes in how people are perceiving this? Specifically, are there more and more banks that are now in the category of, they need to do better digital on boarding and kind of how fast is that evolving? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Brett. There is no question that the majority of the emphasis at -- in really all sized institutions have been focused kind of at the -- the edge of the bank, right. So at the point of intersection between the customers and the financial institution and creating whether it be digital on boarding or any kind of digitization of the variety of financial experiences that customers engage in with their institution. So that's been a big piece of the focus. What we are seeing is, and we announced one of the proof points of it today was around our Dovetail or our market leading payment hub technology. We had, I think five signings in the core -- in the quarter. And that's really about enabling pieces of the back office. So think about it as payments modernization to keep up with -- what the real time right now world that's happening at the edge. And so we are seeing a lot of exploration into that call it the end-to-end that's necessary to ultimately deliver those experiences to the retail and the commercial customers and the small business customers of the bank. So, we are seeing that happening. If you said, is it more about the using your words to spaghetti or more about the experience, it's more about the experience, but I will say that the need to bring the solutions together is making its way back into some of the infrastructure and turning -- turning kind of some of the legacy into more modern systems. And that's going to take a long time to get done, but that's where we see people into RFPs and taking a look at what do we need to do at Fiserv, you see more -- more end to end on that front. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And the follow-up, another kind of product question is, I and I think others are excited about having a couple of the big mega deal companies kind of own if you will the relationship, both on the funding account, on the consumer side, the DDA, and then the merchant point of sale and things and maybe some interesting near term easy wins to make transactions more frictionless or maybe also little more science fiction down the road, can you -- now that you've studied this combination for a while, can you talk any more about how you're seeing those opportunities evolve? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So and Brett obviously, you've noticed for a long time, you know that's one of the areas that we've been focused on really since back to 2012 when we bought CashEdge to really accelerate our focus on P2P through Popmoney and obviously now Zelle. I mean we're very, very excited about the opportunity to use the -- you call that the funding account, the transactional account as a way for consumers to interact -- interact with -- with any of their providers in a -- in a more frictionless way. And I think that's going to manifest in a variety of different forms over the next several years. And for us, we just want to make sure that we're in this, we think the scale of First Data with kind of roughly 40% of the merchant footprint and the scale of Fiserv with over 100 million transaction accounts, we like that, we like the optionality and we're excited to work with our partners, with financial institutions and ultimately with some corporates to see what's out there that can deliver better service. I think for now, we're really studying that. We'll be able to study it a lot closer once we close, but we're very excited about that and we're going to continue to plant flags around areas like Zelle because we think that is one of the differentiators to make some of that, what I think you call that science fiction some of that actually happen. Brett Huff : Great. That's all I need. Thanks for the time. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Brett. Operator : And the next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about revenue synergies, more in the context of timing. Now that you've had a little time to dig in and look under the hood, what is your kind of most updated thinking on which specific opportunities are most kind of realizable or in the near term sort of quickly realizable understanding that your -- the bulk of the benefit we'll see probably in '20 rather than '19, which opportunities feel the most sort of readily achievable? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, I mean it is when we -- when we had talked about this originally, we talked about kind of the payments and network innovation opportunities playing an important role in the near term call it over the next 12 to 18 months. We are going to be very, very focused on the -- on selling. I mean we're excited to have a chance to get out of the blocks a little bit faster than we thought. We think bank merchant is a very good opportunity in the near term and the reality is, is that we have businesses like our biller solutions business where we do a little part of the -- the overall acquiring with the -- with these providers and being able to bring First Data in and having them be able to bring us and we see a lot of, we call it integrated sales, but a lot of real high value cross sell that can move pretty quickly. Again, we won't know until we hit. The problem that we have to the extent that there is a timing problem is, as you know, Ramsey, we have to shell it and then we have to implement it and then it has to go live. We like bank merchant. We think some of those things going to happen quickly. Some of the network and payments opportunities we think can happen quickly. And so we see those to be a little bit faster than the others, but we're going to be focused on that and you'll hear us talk about how we're doing on that each and every quarter. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. I want to just -- one follow-up I wanted to ask about the industry more broadly. It just seems like the universe is scaling up your M&A, what's your view on how this broader processing industry looks into five years? Do you think the space just continues to really dramatically pull up. So even players with the scale that you guys are sort of amassing will get larger and larger and larger or do you think there is some measure of stability that we've achieved with these kind of specific deals kind of having been consummated recently? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. It's a really great question and I fear that we won't have time to go fully back and forth. I would say that if you would have asked many of the industry participants that you're referring to five years ago, if they would have thought that five years later that the industry would have taken the steps it had taken, I suspect that people would say no and certainly if you have asked how quickly, if at all changed, I think you would get an absolute, you've got to be kidding me. From our perspective, we see opportunities to deploy capital every single day. But it's important for us to stay really focused on one of the key drivers to the more than 33,000% return we've had over the last 33 years as a public company, and that's making sure we're allocating capital to drive value for shareholders. So we're going to remain focused on the -- with the capital allocation strategy that we've used and if occasionally, there is something meaningful to do, we'll certainly consider it, but we see lots of ways to drive value without having to do major scale transactions. I think we'll have to see how they come together over the next few years. We're just really, really focused on how do we drive as much cash flow for shareholders that we can and make sure we deploy that capital to build the most value possible. Ramsey El-Assal: Very helpful, thanks. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Perlin : Thanks, good afternoon. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hi, Dan. Daniel Perlin : How you doing? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Good. Daniel Perlin : I had a question about the kind of fintechs and payments and really other areas increasingly becoming these kind of quasi deposit gatherers. And here, I'm thinking like Square's debit and Venmo's debit card, were there clearly trapping cash now where they used to let it kind of be more of a straight-through process with these -- with these entities. And so I'm just wondering Jeff, when you look at your portfolio, what are the -- what are the products or services that you've created to help kind of come back as competitive threats for your bank today? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, it's really, it's an interesting time and whether -- whether you're talking about the Chimes or the N26s and lots of other things are going on, whether they be traditional banks are non-traditional banks, PayPal of course and -- and I put Venmo as the hero example of what has to happen to make sure that the Payments -- I'm sorry that the deposit balances are being trapped in the banks. So I think that's one of them. I think to the extent that we can make sure that we are enabling more commerce to happen at point of sale and whether that be through better decisioning models or point of sale lending right credit are being available at the point of thought, those kinds of things so that consumers don't go to other places. I think the whole intersection of digital experience better decisions based on data. I think we'll see that become very important. Venmo is a little bit of a -- of a capsule. And what can you put in it and around it to make sure not Venmo, I'm sorry, Zelle what do you put around that to make sure that it's driving value for the financial institution clients and then the other thing is, I think you'll see us as part of the $0.5 billion that we're going to invest. I think you'll see a fair amount of that go to the points of intersection between financial experience, commerce and making sure that banks are winning with their -- with their deposit gathering. Daniel Perlin : That's great. The follow-up question I had is the $120 million of interest savings that you just talked about on the financings. Just philosophically, how should we be thinking about that. Are you planning on letting that flow through into the pro forma model early or are you viewing that opportunity as a way in which to invest more quickly in this transaction's integration? Thank you. Robert W. Hau: Yeah, Dan, it's Bob. I would look at it as an opportunity to grow our earnings per share from a standpoint of invest back in the Company. We're certainly planning to appropriately invest as needed to get at the synergies as well at both on the cost and the revenue standpoint and that's fully baked into the model. As Jeff pointed out in the prepared remarks, we're very comfortable that we will achieve the -- at least 20% earnings accretion in year one, and 40% at full run rate synergies. That $120 million of lower interest certainly helps with that. It also generates some cash flow, allows us to pay debt down faster and get back into share repurchase. Daniel Perlin : Fantastic. Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research Company. Your line is now open. Matthew O'Neill: Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. My only question at this point is really just a follow-up, I think to Darren's question earlier around the BAM's JV and how that process is going. I know it's still a little premature for you guys to talk about it. One thing Jeff that you said that I was hoping I could just glean some more color from with that there'll be no impact for three to five years. Is there any kind of read through to that, there is this view that the ownership percentage might come down and maybe some discussion on the exclusivity ending and so certain merchants might be rolling off as their contracts kind of expire over that sort of three to five year phase? Or is that just, this is how far we can sort of confidently see into the future for now and we'll update you more as we hear how the deal progresses? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Matt, I mean, and thanks for asking the follow-up. The -- what I was trying to say is, for at least the next three to five years, and it really is a matter of, it's hard to look that far into the future in a scenario that is not fully baked, but there's no cliff at the end of that. It's just a matter of saying, we think that should give investors confidence that there is nothing to really worry about at this stage and that as the ultimate facts come to light, we'll work very cooperatively with and no matter what the scenario is, to make sure that both sides are being optimized in what they're doing. And I do think one of the unique things here is, this is not -- this arrangement no matter how it ends up playing out, It's not a win lose scenario, It's going to be a win-win scenario and everyone feels like that's been the case. Obviously, we haven't been in the direct conversations, but that's really the outcomes that are being driven here. Matthew O'Neill: Got it. Thank you very much. And then just as a final follow-up on that, if I can. Has there been any sort of cross discussion on Bank of America regarding the CheckFree relationship, which I think is next up and maybe 2023 I suspect not, but just figured out too. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, and we just to be even more blunt, we have not had any direct conversations with the bank. We are operating as separate companies on the joint venture discussion and there hasn't on for Fiserv, there hasn't been any specific conversation pointing out that. We have a very good relationship with the bank on that front and we're always looking to make sure that we're helping Bank of America to continue to be the number one digital bank in the US and that's an important part of it strategy. Matthew O'Neill: Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good afternoon. Good to talk to you. Jeff, you mentioned and highlighted Dovetail as part of Fiserv's real-time payments, infrastructure offerings and efforts. BillPay is a product that or service that is back in the news these days. And I wonder if you can just elaborate on how you think that market's evolving, whether or not the consolidator model maybe can clawbacks some share from biller direct and to what extent, if any, the merger maybe adds value, and helps you accelerate that shift or drive more bill pay volume across your platform? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. Thanks for the question. That's actually one of my favorite topics. It is an interesting thing because your point of it's a little bit, kind of a little bit in the rear view in terms of people talking about it. It's so interesting because you see all kinds of people trying to get into the business and you wonder, well, why are they trying to do that? And I think they're trying to do that because we all understand that the ability to facilitate payments for a consumer or for a small business, especially through this consolidated model, is way more convenient than website hopping to make that happen. The key is, is how do you bring in the biller and merchant information to make that experience top notch. The other piece of it is ultimately having real time, money movement, real time payments that you can consistently and constantly use across all kinds of billers, is I think the next big twist and the next big point that's going to change that value proposition. And so again, we're working with a number of our partners. It's one of the things that we're very excited about the work with First Data. We think they've got a lot of interesting connectivity to make that happen. And I do think that it may take longer than people understand, but you're going to see bill payment be at the front of real time consumer payments. And so whether you're using your illustrative hypothetical wallet to make a bill payment in real time, or to engage in commerce in real time, or to make a P2P payment in real time, I think you're going to see that come together. And it's one of the reasons why technologies such as Dovetail are so important. As you see new clearings coming online especially here in the US. Andrew Jeffrey : And as a follow-up to that, I always appreciate your insight on the subject. As a follow-up, do you see debit cards generally, or even in specific verticals playing more of a role in bill payment? Or do you think sort of direct ACH BillPay is going to be the -- is still going to be sort of ubiquitous? Robert W. Hau: Again, this is a little bit of the world according to Jeff and I want to make sure that I'm clear about that. If you think about the card space as a pan-based space, right, the 16-digit number, and then you think about the transactional account as an account number model. I see them both having pluses and minuses. The connectivity to the debit card implies speed, real time, safety and securely [Phonetic] and I think that matters. And so figuring out how to bring them together, I think is an interesting way to look at it. Andrew Jeffrey : Thanks a lot. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Hey Jeff. Hope you're well. Jeff, I wanted to ask you a little bit about share repurchase. When you look at after the companies combined, are there benchmarks that you're looking as in, is it strictly a leverage ratio issue? Is it that you've achieved a certain amount of cost savings? Is it that you've invested so much money? Is it what the economy is doing? What's the decision point for you to go back in the market and kind of do what Fiserv has always done, which is return a ton of capital back to shareholders? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. Thanks for asking that question, Kartik primarily because this was the first quarter, I think in my entire tenure where we were unable to buyback a share of stock. And I don't -- for people who know Fiserv and know me, that's not what we aspire to do. So our objective is to look at our leverage ratios, to pay down debt to grow EBITDA and to deploy the capital that we're going to create, the $4 billion or so of free cash flow that we're going to have a few years out, so that we can make sure that we're building shareholder value in a way that we have -- consistent with how we have over the last, at least the last 14 or 15 years. And it'll also obviously depend on our valuation and everything else and we'll continue to use the same methodology that we have historically. And so the real answer is, we'll do it as quickly as we can. As you know, we did not suspend our program. We deferred it, and so I would expect us to get into the market as soon as we have the right level of comfort that we've met our commitments to the rating agencies and that we can build shareholder value effectively and efficiently and consistently. Kartik Mehta : And there's just one last one, Jeff. As you look at your community and regional bank customers, as you know, they're dealing with the net interest margin squeeze possibly, but they're also dealing with investing in all these digital solutions, but unable to get rid of some of the other legacy solutions cost continued to increase for them. How do you see them managing that and do you anticipate that the investment that they're continuing to make will -- that they will be able to do so in the future? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. I mean it's a -- there is a bit of a squeeze in the community bank space whether they be banks or credit unions in the community financial institutions space for the reasons that you're mentioning. And I think one of the opportunities for us is to build products and solutions that will allow these institutions to take advantage of digital, which is a more cost effective way to interact, but also to build revenue. It's one of the reasons why we're even more excited today about the bank merchant opportunity because we think we can see a lot of white space out there, where community-based financial institutions are not optimizing the amount of merchant revenue that they can create. And we're looking at how do we help systemically using our technology to better optimize revenue. So it's a combination of how do we create more revenue, there are certainly going to be -- there's going to be always pressure on costs as there have been for the entire 35 years of our existence. And then lastly, it really is about how do you use this digital ecosystem to be more efficient? I think that's the trifecta that we're at least focused on. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Appreciate it. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Kartik. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thanks. My questions have actually been answered, asked and answered, so thanks and congrats on the close. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Glenn. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Glenn. Operator : The next question is from Timothy Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Timothy Willi : Thanks and good afternoon. Just a housekeeping question around the balance sheet and sort of a discussion around debt and interest. So I think you said you did $12 billion of notes across variety of currencies. First Data had roughly $17 billion, could you just sort of any insights around that $5 billion gap in terms of that that's where the priority to pay down first or if there's possibly some other activity that will happen regarding that we should think about? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Tim. Thanks for the question. We have arranged a $5 billion bank term loan that will round out the $17 billion we need to refinance. So the combination of that $5 billion term loan and the $12 billion of notes that we raised in late June, early July will cover the full $17 billion needed. Timothy Willi : Okay, awesome. Thanks so much for clarifying that. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our last question will be from Vasu Govil with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is now open. Vasu Govil : Hi, thanks. I appreciate you guys squeezing me in last minute. I wanted to extend my congratulations for getting all the approvals. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Vasu Govil : Jeff, I just wanted to follow-up on the discussion regarding international synergies before. Can you elaborate a little bit on what type of products you are focused on there? Are we thinking about potentially selling core banking products into First Data's distribution outside or more on the payment side? And then if you could also talk about what kind of capital investments might be acquired to enable that? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. So I would say -- right now we have one core banking platform called Signature that we sell outside the US. We also have a -- we also sell that inside the US. And so we'll continue to focus on that. But really we're most excited about leveraging the existing First Data footprint to try to go-to-market with some of our digital products, which we have a good footprint around the world. Dovetail, we're very excited about Dovetail, payment hubs. The modernization of the payments ecosystem is happening actually more rapidly outside the US and inside the US and Dovetail was a UK company, when we acquired it with most of their presence outside the US and so for us, gaining more distribution is a great example. We also have some strong cash-oriented products, risk products, some fraud products, data warehousing, a number of different products that we can just add on or hopefully add onto the relationships that we have and we don't see those being significant investments. The other thing that we have is First Data has a nice footprint of data centers outside the US. We don't have data centers outside the US and the ability to take some of our products and not just deliver them on a licensed basis, but deliver them on a hosted basis, will allow us to build not just revenue, but really the high quality recurring revenue that we strive to deliver. Vasu Govil : Thank you. That's very helpful. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And thank you everyone for joining us today. We are -- we always appreciate your support and we're really excited to come Monday to close the transaction with First Data, and start the new Fiserv. So thanks everyone. Have a good evening.

Finally, please mark your calendar for our Investor Day to be held on March 25th in New York City. We look forward to seeing you for this important event . And now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to be with you today as we share our first quarter of combined results, along with our insights and enthusiasm for the future of your company. Financial performance is off to an excellent start following the July 29th close of the First Data transaction, led by strong internal revenue growth, expanding adjusted operating margin and growing free cash flow. Synergy work is progressing well and sales momentum continues to be strong. This performance contributed to increasing our internal revenue growth guidance to 6% for the year and adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17%, setting us up for an even better 2020. Although we are a larger more dynamic enterprise, we remain fully committed to delivering upon the key tenants of shareholder value that have underpinned our performance for more than a dozen years, high quality revenue growth, operating margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation are alive and well in new Fiserv. Along those lines, we reinitiated our share repurchase program late in the third quarter under a 10b-5 plan. We are confident in our ability to both meet our debt repayment commitments and repurchase shares. The integration of First Data is top of mind as we focus on building a great company. Yesterday was day 100 of this transformational merger, and we're really excited about the road ahead. Energy is high, teams are coming together and our integration activities are progressing well. Creating success for our clients is number one on our integration agenda and foundational to the promise of this combination. As I mentioned upfront, we're off to a great start financially with internal revenue growth in the quarter up more than 6%, led by a very strong 10% in our GBS merchant business and adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 130 basis points to 29.8% and free cash flow was more than $800 million. For the year-to-date, Internal revenue growth was also 6% with GBS up again 10% for the period. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $2.87 and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1%. Free cash flow through September 30th was 13% -- was up 13% to just over $2.3 billion, and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 116%. We continue to be intensely focused on growing high-quality free cash flow and allocating that capital in a way that optimizes value creation on both an overall and on a per share basis. Now before I turn the call to Frank to update you on integration and synergy progress, let me share a few proof points on how the combination extends and enriches our strategic position. Account processing is a critically important business, which also provides a strategic hub to further distribute high-quality solutions in a cost effective manner, such as our new offerings around merchant services. Along those lines, we were pleased to sign another 14 core account processing clients in the quarter, including six on DNA and assigned 41 clients year-to-date. We will continue to invest in enabling our account processing clients to serve their customers in a real-time digitally focused world. Unlocking client value and expanding growth across our market-leading merchant acquiring business is one of our highest priorities. Our cloud-based point-of-sale platform Clover crossed the $100 billion threshold in annualized payment volume in the quarter, a more than 40% gain over last year. Add-on Clover services are growing rapidly and payment devices shipped is up 25% through September 30th. We're also seeing significant growth opportunities across our e-commerce merchant business, which on top of strong sales grew transactions more than 30% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Additionally, our integrated payments ISV Partners expanded by more than 20% in the quarter. We're incredibly optimistic about the future growth potential in these digitally centric merchant businesses. A key strategic focus is to extend our position as the largest merchant acquirer in the world. The combination of a highly advantaged bank merchant opportunity, rapidly accelerating growth in digital commerce, global distribution and the continued strength of our Clover platform positions us to further expand market share in this important space. The market continues to embrace payments innovation as the new norm. We believe our scale with more than one billion payment cards in force, a leadership positions in areas such as card network, electronic bill payment, ACH and Zelle combined to create meaningful growth today and optionality for tomorrow. Last, we have a significant opportunity to meaningfully participate in global franchise growth. Whether looking at cash to card payments in India, gaining acceptance share in Brazil and Argentina or enabling more e-commerce in Europe, we are more holistically participating in the long tail of global growth. As a complement, we've identified a series of meaningful revenue synergy opportunities outside the US, further leveraging the solution breadth and processing scale of the combined company. With that let me turn the call over to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here as part of the new Fiserv. As we mentioned earlier, we are only 100 days into this transformational merger of two great companies, and I am even more energized today as we dive into the business and see the wide range of opportunities ahead. Let me first start by stating that the power of this new company has far greater reach than I imagine when we decided to put it together. That conclusion is derived from the many senior level client meetings we've had, and how well the value proposition comes together in the client's office. We've established business units led by exceptional management teams comprised of leaders from both companies. As you can imagine, Jeff and I carefully considered each of the leadership positions across our businesses and put together the team, which we believe will drive great results around the world. As you may know, I, along with the senior members of our team, have had the firsthand opportunity to work on some of the more transformational mergers in the financial services industry, and we're utilizing those experiences to help ensure we execute extraordinarily well. The team's engagement model and partnership is at the very highest level I've ever seen and with a clear determination to build a great global company for the long-term benefit of clients, associates and shareholders. When two large and complex companies come together it's essentially associates. The lifeblood of the company is highly engaged on two fronts : the business-as-usual operation of the company and successful execution of the full set of integration activities. We are thrilled at how well the people of both companies have come together to focus on what matters. We are pleased with our progress on revenue synergies and have confidence that we will at a minimum meet the $500 million target, including nearly $100 million of synergy revenue next year. Currently, we have 78 work streams in process across the company, focused on delivering additional client value. In addition to near term value, we're also thinking about how the payments industry may evolve over the longer-term, and how we, as an industry leader, can use a unique combination of assets to drive sustainable, profitable growth beyond the synergy work to-date. As we mentioned, one of the most important revenue synergies is to better serve the account processing client base of the original Fiserv through distributing high-quality merchant-acquiring solutions. Enabling technologies such as Clover to be distributed digitally and through the physical branch network of original Fiserv clients is a significant opportunity, which is literally being validated daily. We have already signed more than 20 core account processing clients with about half being competitive takeaways. Of the competitive wins, five had assets ranging from $1 billion to $6 billion, and there are more than 200 financial institutions in the pipeline, enabling clients to enhance the relationship with their most important clients while delivering much-needed fee revenue is resonating as a very compelling value proposition. Based on the market reaction, we now expect to exceed the $200 million revenue synergy opportunity we originally identified for this initiative. We're also making excellent progress on our network routing and card issuing revenue opportunities, which is extending existing card and network relationships, along with identifying ways to create incremental market differentiation. The combination of Star and Accel further enhances our position as the third largest network in the US with important issuer and merchant clients. In addition, with more than 1 billion active credit and debit cards globally, we have an opportunity to innovate in new and unique ways. We have identified a meaningful number of revenue synergies outside the US, which go beyond original revenue thesis. In addition to delivering merchant and issuing services globally, we're seeing momentum in areas such as payments modernization, core banking, digital solutions and risk with important emphasis in providing hosted solution throughout scaled infrastructure throughout the world. We have also identified numerous opportunities to provide additional solutions to clients, in which one or both of the original firms has an influential relationship. As I mentioned, we've had the pleasure to meet with a number of clients and in each meeting, there has been substantial discussion about how Fiserv can deliver additional value as a result of the combination. We have completed an in-depth white space opportunity analysis for our largest clients and are very optimistic about what the future holds for delivering incremental client value and revenue growth. Moving to cost synergies. We are making excellent progress against our objective of at least $900 million over the first five years, which as you know does not include interest savings. Like revenue, our internal objective is to surpass that goal in terms of both dollars and time to achieve. Our initial focus has been to identify duplicate costs across the company with an emphasis on our corporate and technology functions. We're off to a great start with high visibility and action plans in place to achieve our objectives. Our goal is to streamline our overall cost structure, while delivering more compelling and even higher quality solutions to our clients. We are also leveraging the global product development captive Fiserv built to extend the productivity of our resources while reducing overall cost. One of the larger cost synergy opportunities is design efficiency and effectiveness across our more than $4 billion of annual vendor spend. We are methodically meeting with our suppliers and engaging in productive conversations which we believe will contribute meaningfully to our cost synergy objectives. We have created a strong focus in governance structure to ensure we achieve our synergy objectives. We have actioned over $200 million of annualized saves against our $900 million cost target. Importantly, we expect that level to grow every week increasing the probability of outperformance over the period. As you've have heard, we are highly confident in achieving our synergy targets and have additional focus on overachieving in terms of quantum and diamond. We will supply a full update including any increases to our targets at our March Investor Day. We also are evaluating the best way to deploy the incremental $500 million innovation investment pool to create market differentiation and drive additional revenue growth beyond synergies. We are evaluating a variety of opportunities in areas such as digital commerce, card payments, risk and fraud solutions and network innovation. We will also share more on this important initiative with you in March. Let me also provide a quick update on our progress with BAMS joint venture. As we discussed on our July 30 call, we are working with the bank collaboratively through a well-defined contractual process to dissolve the JV in June 2020, and ensure we deliver great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that Fiserv's results will be accretive over the next few years as we leverage the significant scale within the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start by calling your attention to four items included in our reported results and reflected in the Form 8-K filed on October 3rd. First, internal revenue growth will be reported on a constant currency basis, consistent with the First Data methodology. For clarity, we have not made any FX adjustments to EBITDA, which is different than how FTC we had reported nor to operating income or adjusted EPS. Next, First Data previously added back stock-based compensation and reporting its adjusted earnings metrics. We now conform to our practice of including stock-based compensation in the adjusted income statement. Third, First Data had previously reported adjusted revenue for its joint ventures using proportional consolidation. Beginning with this quarter, results from minority-owned joint ventures will mirror GAAP and no longer be reflected in adjusted revenue and adjusted operating income. Our share of the net income from these JVs is reported as income from investments and unconsolidated affiliates. We will continue to report bands using proportional consolidation as we believe that approach best reflects how we will report the results of this business upon dissolution. Finally, we're reporting our adjusted results across four segments. First Data, which reflects First Data's historic business segments : Payments and Financial, which our original Fiserv's two business segments. And last, we combine both companies' corporate segments into a single item. We will report our results in this fashion for the remainder of the year and expect to roll out a new segment structure beginning in 2020. We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year and are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial performance. Adjusted revenue was up 5% to $3.6 billion in the quarter and 4% to $10.7 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was a strong 6% in both the quarter and year-to-date driven by all three business segments delivering higher growth through September 30. As expected, revenue synergies were modest in the quarter and will accelerate over time. Overall, internal revenue growth performance through September 30th is slightly ahead of our expectations for the year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion in the quarter and is up 8% to $3.1 billion through the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.8%, up 130 basis points versus the prior year. As you know, we had expected stronger margin performance in the second half of the year in the original Fiserv business as we lap much of the prior-year tax reinvestments. Operating margin also benefited by increased revenue growth and some limited benefit from cost synergies, partially offset by the Elan acquisition. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1% with each of the segments showing increases. Given the July 29 close actual synergy benefits realized in the quarter were modest. Revenue synergy action plans are on track to achieve our year one target of nearly $100 million and we've already actioned annualized run rate cost synergies of more than $200 million. We are highly confident that we will meet or exceed both the revenue and cost synergy targets. Now keep in mind that interest savings are not included in the $900 million cost synergy target. The total of target cost synergies and the expected interest savings is in excess of $1.1 billion annually. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02 in the quarter and increased 16% to $2.87 year-to-date. These results included a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.08 per share for the third quarter and year-to-date respectively. Overall, we are very well positioned to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In the First Data segment, adjusted revenue was up 3% to $2.2 billion for the quarter and up 2% through September 30th to $6.4 billion. These results for both periods include headwinds from last year's Q3 divestitures. Segment internal revenue growth was a strong 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date and is up more than 100 basis points compared to last year. This performance included excellent results in the former GBS segment recording 10% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. These results also include 7% growth in the quarter for GBS North America and 6% growth for the year-to-date. The primary drivers of our strong growth are digital commerce, ISV Solutions, Clover and global merchant acquiring. For example, ISV revenues have grown more than 60% year-to-date and we've added more than 18,000 new ISV merchants. Overall, contracted merchant locations globally, both digital and physical, have expanded low-double digits this year. In card issuer processing, we are seeing solid trends in global credit card accounts on file, which grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the on boarding of new clients and growth in existing portfolios. FTC had previously treated plastics resell revenue as a pass-through item. Given that original Fiserv provides plastics production, this is now included as adjusted revenue. This reporting change created a headwind in Q3 and becomes a bit more pronounced in the fourth quarter. International growth continues to be a bright spot, delivering high teens internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date and growth has come from a combination of new issuing and merchant business with strong payment macros in places such as Brazil and India. The First Data segment adjusted operating income increased 5% to $667 million in the quarter and is up 4% to $1.9 billion through the first nine months of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points to 30.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong revenue growth and cost containment offset by pressure from foreign currency. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 30.3%. As we enter 2020, we don't plan to separately report the former First Data segment or sub-segment growth rates. As we provide new segments, we'll supply the key financial and business metrics, which we believe best align with our strategic plans and expected financial results. Moving to the Payments segment, which is original Fiserv only, adjusted revenue was up 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $861 million and $2.5 billion respectively, including the benefit of the Elan acquisition. Internal revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially and a 5% year-to-date, led primarily by strong performance in our card services, electronic payments and output solutions businesses. Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 16% to $309 million in the quarter and 11% to $899 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 35.9%, up 150 basis points over the prior year and adjusted operating margin for the first nine months was up 10 basis points to 35.3%. Results in the quarter and year-to-date benefited from additional revenue growth and the reduction of last year's tax funded investments, partially offset by the impact of the Elan acquisition, which anniversaried on October 31st. Debit transactions grew high single digits in both the quarter and year-to-date. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 14% in the quarter to 9 million and Mobiliti business clients increased 18% as the US continues to embrace digital banking services. P2P transactions, which includes both Popmoney and Zelle continue to show strong results doubling versus Q3 last year and up 15% sequentially. Zelle transactions alone nearly tripled in the quarter, buoyed by the number of live clients nearly doubling sequentially. We signed 130 Zelle clients in the quarter, more than the first two quarters of the year combined and almost 3 times the number signed in Q3 last year. For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 4% to $596 million for the quarter and up 1% to $1.8 billion year-to-date, including the lending transaction, which anniversaried at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth in this segment was 4% in the third quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially, and as 4% year-to-date led by our account and item processing businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment grew 5% to $196 million in the quarter and is up 1% to $598 million through the first nine months of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 32.9% and up 10 basis points year-to-date to 33.3%. The results in the quarter and year-to-date are stronger than they appear, given a reduction in periodic revenue, which has been more than offset by the benefit of high-quality recurring revenue growth and operational efficiency. The adjusted corporate operating loss, which includes the combined corporate expenses of both original businesses, was $93 million for the quarter and $314 million year-to-date. Now we expect the fourth quarter corporate expenses to be generally consistent with that of Q3. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter, and is 20.8% for the first nine months of the year. And we expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 24% and our full year adjusted tax rate to be about 22%. You may recall First Data has a meaningful tax NOL, which should create a -- continue to create a lower cash tax rate for the next several quarters. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and is up 13% to $2.3 billion year-to-date with free cash flow conversion of 116%. As a result of our normal portfolio management process, we reached agreement to divest two small product lines for $133 million in the quarter. These businesses represent about $8 million of revenue per quarter and both closed in October. We issued 286 million shares on July 29th to complete the First Data transaction. And in late September, we began repurchasing shares in line with our long-standing capital deployment strategy. We repurchased 341,000 shares for about $35 million in the quarter and 2 million shares for approximately $156 million year-to-date. We have 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We remain fully committed to returning to our historic leverage -- level over the next 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth. Total debt outstanding as of September 30th, which is about 75% fixed, was $22.5 billion and debt-to-EBITDA was 3.9 times. With that, let me call it -- turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Bob. We begin our new Fiserv journey with a far larger opportunity to deliver value to the market. Combined sales performance was up 15% in the quarter and is up 8% year-to-date. We had a number of important wins in the quarter such as signing the California DMV and its 180 locations to the Clover platform. We also had larger competitive wins in the integrated payment space such as Dash platform, Smart Service and MRI. And we added all the north and all the south to global supermarket chain store with locations across 19 markets to our e-commerce solutions. We were also pleased to expand our relationship with Golden 1 Credit Union in the quarter with a bundle of new value, including ATM Managed Services. We signed Western Alliance Bank with more than $25 billion in assets and TBK Bank with nearly $5 billion of assets to our dovetail payment hub. And last, DNA momentum continued in the quarter signing six new clients and competitive processes, including Landmark Credit Union, Wisconsin's largest credit union with more than $4.2 billion in assets, and Verve, a credit union with about $1.3 billion in assets. Our sales pipeline remains strong and importantly, the weighted pipeline of revenue synergies is approaching $100 million of annual revenue. We expect the synergy pipeline and related sales to grow as the market experiences the new Fiserv. For those tracking the original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 46% in the quarter and 17% through September 30th. Operational effectiveness performance remained on track with $11 million achieved in the quarter and $36 million of savings year-to-date. Now on to guidance. We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% for the year with the fourth quarter coming in around 5%, due primarily to a slightly better-than-expected Q3, a tough prior year compare, including lower periodic revenue in our Financial segment and some purchase revenue adjustments. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.98 to $4.02 for the year, growth of 16% to 17%, which includes more than 300 basis points of negative impact from FX on our full year adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points for the year, and that free cash flow conversion will be approximately 115%. Although we are in the midst of our 2020 planning, we will provide a very preliminary view into our expected performance. For full clarity, this is not official guidance or outlook. Those data will be provided in our February call. As of today, considering the strong performance of the existing business, expected synergies and the current view into the continuing headwind from FX, we anticipate 2020 internal revenue growth of at least 7% and that adjusted earnings per share will grow plus or minus 25% over 2019's actual performance. This has been a monumental year for Fiserv. We were named the World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row, celebrated our 35th anniversary and, most importantly, combined with First Data to help achieve our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world. And while others have followed our lead, we are even more confident today that our solution set, global scale and significant investment capacity underpins an unparalleled opportunity for clients, associates and shareholders. Let us also thank our 44,000 associates around the world for their commitment and enthusiasm to building our new enterprise while continuing to serve clients with excellence. Each of you working together are truly Fiserv at our best. With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Koning with Baird. You may go ahead, sir. David Koning : Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats, incredible performance. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. David Koning : Yeah. And maybe to start out, I mean, to have guidance over 7% for next year, what seems like is happening is First Data has kind of gone from a few years ago losing share to actually -- it seems like they're gaining share now. And you guys kind of called out digital ISV Clover Global Solutions all that fast growth stuff. Is North America actually kind of in an acceleration mode? Maybe how big is the really fast growth part now? Has that gotten to scale that it can accelerate the total North America growth now? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So Dave, there's a lot of questions that are in there. Let me take the first part of it, and then have a Frank fill in the blanks and perhaps Bob will have something to add to it as well. I would say that if you start kind of at a little bit more of a macro level, you'll remember when we got on the phone in January 16 and announced the transaction, that it was our belief that there was a mismatch between what was going on in the company and how investors were thinking and what we were seeing. And what we are seeing was that Frank and the management team had really put the company on the right path that they were making fantastic progress. And I'll let Frank talk about that. And it's an incredible testament to what the team has done to have delivered 10% growth both in the quarter and the year-to-date. But it was our belief that technologies such as Clover right with over $100 billion in annualized GPV growing at 40%, which is actually an increase from the prior year's growth rate. And then you think about Integrated Payments and ISV, and e-commerce growing 30% in transactions that these pockets were moving absolutely in the right direction. But don't forget, there's still a big partner solutions business. There's lots of other pieces of the business that continue to just move in the right direction. So, I think, we have a lot of room to continue to run and we'll be focused on that. The e-commerce business signed 30 new logos this year alone. So, we're taking the right steps and we're moving forward. And I think we believe that it will continue to grow. And also obviously, we have our international businesses that have been growing quite well. Frank, why don't you... Frank J. Bisignano: I think -- I think the only other thing I would add is, these are technology-based businesses. Our acquisitions going back in time to us buying Clover -- fully integrating Clover into the company, but letting it thrive as a Silicon Valley entity. Then the acquisitions in the ISV business, which is beginning to really show up, which were CardConnect and BluePay, and bringing that technology integrating it in an integrated company and bringing technology on top of that to bring the best solutions that we thought technically were in the market. And then, e-com is a constant investment for us and you can count on us having continued investment in all three of these to continue a growth trajectory in those businesses. And international has been a star for us, but that was something that we started out with very little market share. And you see that as a strong double-digit grower for us. But the technical business, the partnership in this new company, will just help this. I mean, if you want to ask about North America, you hear us talking about the privileged position that Fiserv had with its great core clients. And the reason why we've been able to go in, and I think you got to absorb that 20 wins in a 100-day period of time, that's from start of discussion to signing. And when you have $6 billion institutions and competitive takeaways, it's about the privileged position that Fiserv had with these clients. And I think Jeff and I have thought about good ways to bring it together, ways always that the clients are delighted with. David Koning : Great, guys. Thanks. And I'll just ask a very short follow-up. I know free cash flow and buybacks are so important to you guys. What do you think the Q4 share count is going to be just because it's confusing right now with partial quarter in Q3? Robert W. Hau: Yes, David, it's Bob. We bought -- we started buying back in late September. We talked about we'll have some modest buyback under that 10b5 program. The way to think about it, if you look in our press release, there's a couple of tables in there. We're about 695 million shares overall is the way to think about it. David Koning : Great. Great job. Thanks guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hi, Lisa. Lisa Ellis : Congratulations. Hi. Can you talk a little bit about is now you've got all of you guys together converged entity about international, a place where legacy First Data has had a lot of success. Not -- and historically a focus area for Fiserv, but as you're looking into sort of the investment priorities of the combined entity, what's the role of your international expansion? What are the priority geographies? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Lisa. I think, first of all, you -- I know that you've watched the international growth of First Data, and it was very, very targeted. And countries that we believe had a good payment economies had lots of runway in cash to cashless, and our ability to bring our skill sets and tools there, and partner with great banks also. When we looked at the company, we found that the ability to take both institutions, put them together, run a very, very integrated business in each country and in each region, and then begin talking to our clients. That is one of the favorite things we like to do, visit clients, talk to them, talk to them about the solutions. So as we said before, I think there's great opportunity for us to bring merchants and issuing product into old Fiserv clients. And we think there's great opportunity to take many of the good products we have everywhere from dovetail to the way we could have hosted solutions for institutions which we have great relationships with. And I would say international, if you went to where we originally started, it's a much brighter spot and opportunity in totality, and our regional heads have been often running and doing a great job in integrating this company. Robert W. Hau: Lisa, I would only add, when Frank and I and the teams were going through the combination analysis and looking for where were the big opportunities, we, to some extent, put international off to the side, because we had in the original Fiserv such a small international presence. And even though we had a fair amount of country diversity and maybe a larger amount of product diversity, we didn't necessarily think we would have the scale. And one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by is because of the infrastructure the scale that First Data brought to the party, we're able to take our solutions. host them for clients and run them and create recurring revenue. And there's been a lot of energy. If you're in a local jurisdiction, you want product, and we had a lot of product. There are a lot of relationships. And so, we've got a lot more energy going back and forth. And we will now, because of the combined company, we have reasonable scale. We will certainly look to deploy capital outside the US where it makes sense strategically and for the rest of the benefit of the company. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. And then, maybe my follow-up slightly related on e-com, 30% transaction growth, obviously a fantastic number. Can you give a sense for where in that extremely hot and hotly contested market you're winning? Is that -- should we be thinking this is a multinational omni-channel? Is this platforms where you're the back-end processor behind some of the big platform players. Is this small business USA? Give us a sense for sort of where you're seeing those wins? Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Well, there's been a -- Jeff talked about the number of new logos, and that implication is large and accurate, which are the large institutions. You should think of them as large players who are brands that you aspire to have this business with. So we've been very, very fortunate to have notched a bunch of wins of large institutions who are heavy e-com players. And I think of it in that manner. I think also you can see us having a larger tax rate in our ISV business and other avenues where we're attaching more e-com to our small business and medium-sized ISVs. And yeah, we do have a somewhat privileged position as being a processor for some large players also, but I think when you look at the totality of what Jeff talked about in the winning space, it's been more at the front of the shop not at the back of the shop. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, it's really been quite impressive. The list of names that the company has been able to bring into this table over the last couple of years, including a number of important names this year, as Frank said to some extent, aspirational names in industries that we are aware of. But there's also a fair amount of middle market, most of what we're seeing right now is in the OmniPay space, but in that middle market. So we're making great progress there. And we're building out a model where we're delivering incremental services so that we're able to create more value on a per transaction basis. So, it's early. We've had this conversation, but the momentum is, I think, far greater than certainly we understood, but as important I think more than the outside world is understood. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Darrin Peller : Hey. Thanks, guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hey, Darrin. Darrin Peller : Hey, guys. I just want to touch on -- look, if we hone in a bit more on the First Data growth, given the source of strength and upside versus prior rates. I mean again, you mentioned the strength in GBS continuing to trend well. If we could just break that down a little further on perhaps even in the US of the Partner Solutions business, the direct business, JVs, it seems like the Partner Solutions continues to really holding their strong. And then, maybe just to add on to that, if you've seen any cross-sells on -- maybe has the Clover cross-sell into the digital banking side or just through your bank channels started yet, how has that been going? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So let me start and Frank will again add in -- will play off of each other on that. To answer your latter question first, we've seen exactly no revenue to-date from the bank channel. Lots of energy, as Frank talked about, 20 wins in 100 days and a large pipeline and lots of interest, which is particularly important now in a time where fee revenue is increasingly important and we're obviously looking to help our clients. So lots there. We are making real progress in deeply integrating the Clover technology into the digital solutions in which we control with our development shop. And so we don't have to deal with some of the exogenous factors that can get in the way of digital performance. So, from that perspective, that's all good. But again, to reiterate that's not in the numbers at this stage. It's really across the Board in merchant. Obviously, the things that we like to talk about are the digital commerce technologies and the things that are \"a little sexier\" than maybe some of the others. But Partner Solutions continues to be incredibly important. Whether it is our business consultants who are out signing up merchants every day or signing a new ISV provider or a new e-commerce solution, it all comes together. And I think Bob in his prepared remarks talked about the fact that that merchant locations overall are up double-digit year-over-year. And I think that really just talks to all things of what we're doing and how we're focused on driving the business in kind of one important vertical at a time. Darrin Peller : All right. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up is on the bill pay cross-sell opportunity. Our checks are suggesting there's a pretty amount of white space in some of your enterprise clients at First Data still. Have you seen further evidence around that? Jeffery W. Yabuki: You heard Frank talk about the number of meetings that we've had with clients and talking about the power of the influential relationships. I mean, I think at this stage, the best way to frame it is, we're having a number of conversations that I don't think either of the original businesses will be having without having done this combination. So, we're bullish about that, but we also don't want the card ahead of the horse. We need to keep moving the processes along. But again, the conversations and the interest levels are quite high. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's great to hear, guys. Thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Ben Budish : Hi, guys. This is Ben Budish on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask a follow-up on an earlier question on the share repurchases. So it's nice to have the confidence to kind of start doing that immediately. Just wondering what kind of pace should we expect while you're paying down debt should be kind of more of the historical norm of quarterly repurchases or maybe I'm more muted into the debt to further pay down? And kind of as a follow-up to that, given that kind of confidence in your cash flow generation, should we maybe expect to see incremental M&A perhaps earlier than expected? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. So, I would say, one of the things that was in our prepared remarks is to make sure that we pointed out that we're buying under a 10b5 plan. And so -- which means that we would expect to be regularly in the market. I would say that we will not be in the market at the pace that we were at before. We are absolutely committed to making sure that we meet our leverage commitments to the agencies and we will for sure do that. And that will come from a combination of cash flow generation, debt repayment and growing EBITDA. So, from that perspective, I think we will pace it well, but cash flow is strong and we feel good about that. We also had a couple of smaller divestitures in the quarter. And so, we'll be looking to create as much opportunity as we can to deploy capital as we have historically. I would say that M&A itself is not a particularly high priority, differentiating and winning in the market is. And so, where there are opportunities for us to deploy capital for M&A and it's meeting our normal disciplined capital allocation deployment, then we're fine. But again, I think our number one priority is making sure that we meet our commitments from a leverage perspective. And then we take it from there. Ben Budish : Okay. Thanks very much. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. David Togut from Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir. David Togut : Thank you and congratulations on the new Fiserv. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, David. David Togut : You called out 46% integrated sales growth in the quarter, Jeff, which I believe is the highest integrated sales growth we've seen at least for Fiserv stand-alone. Are there any major drivers to call out behind that? Is this a pickup in bank IT band, specific solutions gaining more traction? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, it really has to do more with the level of investment that we have been making in our solution sets over the last few years and building product and having that product come to market. And that product has been a combination of internal builds as well as some small M&A that we've done that is enhancing our overall value proposition, specifically in some of the not surprisingly in the digital arenas. So, from that standpoint, it is really just about products that we've built. And I don't know that I would count it to be around growth in bank IT spend, but I do think it is the -- it talks to the importance of making sure you're building solutions in the places that matter most for clients. It's also around areas like deposit transformation, risk, fraud, the normal areas, mobile, digital as we talked about. And then, we believe wholeheartedly that the merchant solutions that we're going to bring the integrated solutions that Frank talked about through Clover and others will even further enhance that. David Togut : Understood. And then, as a follow-up, the preliminary 2020 outlook, can you give us any broad outlines in terms of what you're thinking about for First Data organic versus payments and financial, and then how you're thinking about the cadence of revenue and cost synergies flowing in, in 2020? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. I would say that at this stage a couple of things. Number one, this is not meant to be guidance and the more detail that we give, the more Bob will not be happy with me. So I think we're going to keep it at a pretty high level. The second thing I would say is, remember that we intend to resegment the company. And so, when we give guidance, we'll be giving it across a new segmentation model. And so, I think again getting ahead of that wouldn't make sense. At the higher level, I can tell you that we feel quite comfortable that the kinds of growth that is being delivered in the company is sustainable. And so, there's always going to have ranges around that sustainability. But generally, if you think about the former GBS segment of First Data, 10% growth in the quarter, 10% growth for the first three quarters. To us, that feels like a level of sustainability around that. And we think that each of our segments will continue to grow. You'll remember that it was important for us to look for how could we continually and sustainably step-up internal revenue growth, and so we'll look to do that. And then, the last piece is around the synergies, right? And synergies understand that -- as you know, synergies have to get sold and implemented. There are some things that come on faster than others. That's what I would say as, we would expect that to be more back-end loaded as some of the revenues come on. But again, we'll have to see how that all looks when we give guidance in February. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Brett Huff : Good evening, guys. Congrats on some good results. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks , Brett. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Brett. Brett Huff : Thank you for the preliminary goalpost around the '20 outlook. One thing that I'd like to know is, give us a sense of where there you could maybe do better than that, where there are kind of the tougher parts that you have to kind of perform better on it. Can you give us any -- just for instance is on the kind of upside downside drivers? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. Again, Brett, remembering that we're not giving guidance, we'll give you -- we'll kind of try to give it to you at not the goalpost level, but maybe at the stadium level. So, we had talked about the fact that we expected revenue growth to be at least 7%. And there's a reasonable amount of variability as you start to move across the 50-odd line of the 7%. And that is, how does synergies come on, how quickly do they come on, how do sales go, how do implementations go. Probably the most important thing for us to lay out is, as we sit here today, a lot of things have to go right as always, but everything doesn't have to go right. And that we really thought a lot about what was going to be the right way for us to give this early visibility to '20. And so, we feel like this is a good solid number and that there'll be ways to outperform it. And as Bob will remind me later, there will be ways for us to underperform it. But we do feel on balance that we are in a pretty good place in terms of that -- in terms of the 7%. Brett Huff : Great. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just more drilling down a little bit into the First Data segment. You told us about the NA GBS [Phonetic], which is really helpful. Any thoughts on the growth differential just qualitatively between the kind of the big JVs versus the more broad referral arrangements and kind of the longer tail of the bank channel. Can you give us any sense there on growth and maybe even profitability performance? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. It's Frank. I think you got to think about what we're doing today as continued investment and still getting better growth, right? And the JVs are always a good discussion to have. But I think you got to move to a bigger discussion, which is ISV growth, how long is that runway which is huge. This investment we made in Clover and the hundreds of people that we had developed it out that has us delivering as you heard caught in the $100 billion GPD mark and growing at 40%. So, I think it's all the elements of it, and then what you heard us talking about in e-com. So, a little bit, I'd move away from the dialogue about a JV or a bank channel and move more. And yes, we love the bank channel. You hear us talk about 20 wins in 100 days through the privileged position that Fiserv had. But I would not try to understand each one of those. I would understand the macro trends of ISV, e-com, Clover and digital distribution. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. And I think Brett the thing that's important here is, remember, as we move to more of a GAAP methodology for recognizing the revenue, we were able to unshroud some of the underlying performance in certainly in GBS in the subsegment, formerly known as GBS North America. We were able to unshroud that. Now there are contributions that come in. And I would say that we have had growth contributions from the JVs that are better than they were last year. I would also guess that that is the smallest of the contributors. 0 And to Frank's point, the other pieces of the business are growing faster and will be faster growth vehicles not because as Frank said the banks -- the bank channel and the JVs are not important, they're critically important and we're going to do everything we can to grow them. But we think that the seeds that have been planted in First Data for the last three or four years, whether it be Clover or BluePay or CardConnect or a lot of original or internal development that it takes time for those products to be built and come to market and so that's really -- those are really the bigger drivers, just to reiterate Frank's commentary. Brett Huff : Great. Appreciate the details guys. Congrats again. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi, Jeff, Frank, Bob, congratulations on the good start to the combined journey here. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yeah. So, the question I have is the velocity at which you went from start to finish was remarkable for the bank wins you mentioned. Would be great to kind of get a little bit more granular on the -- on what's feeding that pace and urgency? And is it kind of limited to this subset of clients or prospects you're speaking with? Or can we make any broader suppositions about bank IT spending from there? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, let me start, Ashwin, on that. It's a couple of things. I mean, when Frank and I got together and we talked about this, one of the many points of serendipity was Frank had believed that having an access to be able to get deep integration to a core processing system was really important. And then, we are the largest core processor in the US and really in the world. And so that -- the ability to drive integration, different levels of integration and access to information will allow banks to create a more compelling integrated merchant experience for their customers, and also because these are revenue-sharing partnerships be able to create fee revenue. And you know Ashwin that fee revenue right now is really important. And so you've got a convergence where we love the fact that we not only are -- we have these great relationships with clients, but we get to pay them. And that -- we think that actually works quite well. And it speaks to the 20 wins in 100 days. I just think it speaks to the fact that as we had talked about historically, especially at the smaller end of the ranges that Frank was talking about, you have banks that really haven't paid a lot of attention to it and they see this as a great opportunity to go out and serve their customers and to create some additional fee revenue. And Frank, I think I would say, it's going a little bit better than I anticipated. Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I mean, off to a great start. Off to a great start. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Great. And then a clarification I have is what portion of the 2019 outlook raise is due to synergies for 4Q -- within Q4 forces the components themselves they seem to be doing better at this point? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. I mean, the synergies, Ashwin -- the synergies are very low for this quarter. There'll be something less than very low in the next quarter. But as you know, we talked about the fact that we have actioned annualized run rate synergies of a couple of hundred million dollars. But the substantial majority of that is going to pop in next year. I would say that synergy the idea of synergies in our numbers for 2019 have not had any meaningful impact on how we have set our guidance. They're an important part of next year. And I would say that probably the biggest single driver of what some people consider synergies would be interest expense saves in our numbers vis-a-vis the prior original companies. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. This is good stuff. Thank you, guys. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the good start and the very encouraging 2020 outlook, Jeff and Frank. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Glenn Greene : I guess, the first question, it sounds like -- maybe I'm reading into this but it sounds like you're increasingly confident in the $500 million revenue synergy number. You've talked a bit about it but maybe the areas where specifically you see the upside opportunity relative to what you thought or incremental opportunities that you had are really fully appreciated early on that gives you more confidence in that $500 million? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. I mean this privileged position that we have with the banks, until you go visit them and actually can talk to them, you're not really sure how it's all going to turn out. Now, we knew that we both had deep love of financial institutions and they were our lifeblood. But whether it would turn out this way wasn't all that clear. So, we feel good about how that's going to come out and over the long haul, be worth to heck a lot of money. I'd say, secondly, you heard us talk about international. That's probably something that most people and it's all only put the two together that we would be so bullish on. And I don't think we initially had it in our base case, so to speak, when we thought about it. Maybe we thought we'd save some money. But I think the revenue opportunity there is pretty large. And then, when you move to the spaces like our credit business and putting these two together, it becomes very clear. I'd like to say the biggest proof point for us has been the client's office, right? There's no better thing than Jeff and I have had the benefit of doing multiple client meetings together, and then obviously we do things separately. But it's so clear the power of the franchise and we always come out with more opportunities and more thought. Network will obviously, like credit will be big for us. Output is a tremendous opportunity. So, 100 days in, we feel better than we did when we saw it on the journey. Glenn Greene : Yeah. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And Glenn, we are -- I mean, I think you heard we have good confidence in the $500 million. And we also think it's prudent for us to wait until our Investor Day to really layout in detail how we see it coming together and where we may see opportunities to do a little bit better. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then, just a follow-up question will be the bread selling environment. I mean I heard the 15% bookings growth in the quarter, but just some context on what you're seeing at a high level across the businesses. Your peers are obviously seeing really good results too. So it's kind of curious, a lot of concern about the macro economy, but a lot of companies in the sector are not seeing it. So I'm just curious what you're seeing? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. So, I would say that you if you think about -- you have to think about at least for us -- for us original Fiserv people. We've had to open the aperture and we're happy to do it. We're not just serving primarily financial institutions anymore. We're serving really everyone who does something in the world of payments, commerce, money movement and fintech. And so, from that standpoint, when you think about the entire ecosystem, there's a lot going on. And what's happening in financial institutions is -- financial institutions are biasing their spend to areas in which it's most -- where it is most visible to their customers. So whether it's digital -- sorry, whether it's consumer or commercial by things that are digital, abilities to serve clients in an Amazon-like way that's really where you're seeing money go. And then, just money movement payments that entire space is just fraught with energy and innovation and everyone is looking to make sure that they're on the way. And because of the breadth of the company and the investments that we collectively have been making over the last few years, I think, we're fairly well-positioned. What we have to make sure that we continue to do is that we meet our commitments and deliver for our clients because that's really what they need most right now. Glenn Greene : Okay, thank you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from North Coast Research. You may go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Good afternoon. Jeff, I think, I know the answer to this based on all your commentary for 2019 guidance and your outlook in 2020, but just wanted to get your thoughts. As you have conversations with banks and interest rates are moving all over the place and they're getting pressure on their net interest margin. I'm assuming that's not having an impact on their spend at least as far as you can see and that's the reason for your confidence in 2020. Is that kind of fair? Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would say -- I would say, it's probably too bold to say it's not having any impact on their spend, it is. But what we're seeing and we've seen this before is institutions are making choices. Perhaps their discretionary spend is going down or they're spending less on older systems and more on newer systems again where the institution meets the customer in the places that matter most. So, I do see that going on. And the conversations are how do we do more, and in times like this where you are a full-scale provider, you have opportunities to go in and win more business. And so, we're certainly hoping and building strategy around the fact that we think the suite that we bring on balance is the best in the market. And so, we're looking to Frank's point about how we have client conversations and there's more interest in doing things. There's a lot of opportunity to see, can you do things more efficiently and effectively as one larger enterprise. And so, that was one of the things, Kartik, that we liked about this transaction is, yeah, on one hand, there are some that say it's best to be pure play. We think being broad and the ability to put things together and integrate in new and innovative ways gives us a bit of a market advantage. Kartik Mehta : And just one last question for you, Frank. As you look at Clover customers today versus a year ago, is there been a change in the type of customers that are using Clover? And as you see Clover evolve over the next, let's just -- for the sake of our conveersatake about 12 to 18 months, is that changed at all? Frank J. Bisignano: I think the breadth of Clover continues to see it larger. I think if you go back in time, we talked about dining solutions and delivering to restaurants. So, our breadth that what our development teams are doing is continuing to build functionality that gives us more vertical depth. We've gone outside the US. You see us in Canada. You see us in Europe. You should expect the releases in Latin America. We've been tremendously advantaged as we were strategic in Argentina and how to capitalize on that change, and Clover was part of that strategy. I would also say as we continue to build out functionality with the combination of our ISV solution in Clover, the ability to bring the two together for a best-in-class solution for merchants who use integrated software is what you'll see happen. So, the answer -- the short answer is yes, and the rest was the description of how and where. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Kartik. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We really appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team.

Please refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2019 and 2018 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. For additional historical combined financial information, please refer to the Form 8-K, which we filed on October 3. As a reminder, we'll host an investor conference on March 25 in New York City. We expect the presentation to run from about 8 :30 a.m. to noon, and we'll also host a lunch following the program. We look forward to seeing you at this important event. And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was a year of transformation, growth and excellent financial performance. It was just over a year ago that we announced our plans to transform the industry through the acquisition of First Data and just over 180 days since we've closed. At the announcement, we shared our belief that First Data was a stronger business than people understood and that the industrial logic of the combination was incredibly compelling. We continue to get positive market feedback as we center on creating long-term and differentiated value for clients. Although the transaction has only been closed for a short time, we've made substantial progress against our goals and are even more bullish about the scope of opportunities for the combined company. Our key tenets of shareholder value, high-quality recurring revenue growth, expanding operating margin, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, were on full display in 2019. Our financial performance included internal revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points, and we achieved our 34th year in a row of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Importantly, free cash flow was up 16% to more than $3 billion, driven by excellent free cash flow conversion of 118%. Sales were strong, accelerating to 15% growth in the quarter and up 10% for the year. We repaid debt, as promised, divested several businesses and restarted our programmatic share buybacks earlier than anticipated. These outstanding results, combined to deliver total shareholder return of 57% in 2019 and was also up 118% and 226% for the 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Turning to 2020. Our performance outlook of higher internal revenue growth, superior operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-20s and strong free cash flow is a great start to what we believe will be an outstanding decade for your company. Results for the fourth quarter were right in line with the guidance we provided in Q3. Internal revenue growth of 5% was led by another excellent quarter in our merchant business, up 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was up 18% to $1.13, and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 31.4%. Free cash flow was outstanding, reaching nearly $1 billion in the quarter. Full year internal revenue growth was up a very strong 6%, adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $4, and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.7%. Free cash flow for the full year increased 16% to $3.3 billion. We are intensely focused on growing high-quality free cash flow and allocating that capital in a way that optimizes long-term shareholder value on both an overall and per share basis. We continue to see strategic, operational and market proof points, which taken together, reinforces the power of the combination. Momentum is strong, and our opportunity to differentiate is greater than ever. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses are critical in our strategy to serve clients exceptionally well. One of our key priorities is to deeply integrate high-value solutions, such as our bank merchant offering which enables our clients to generate revenue while serving their most important customers. Along those lines, we signed 24 new account processing clients in the quarter, including 10 on DNA, such as AgFirst Farm Credit Bank with more than $34 billion in assets; American Eagle Financial Credit Union, the largest community-based credit union in Connecticut with $1.8 billion in assets; an independent bank with $3.6 billion in assets. Our Clover platform has continued its stellar growth, increasing its annualized gross payment volume by more than 40% year-over-year. Payment devices shipped was up 25% for the year, and the adoption of add-on Clover services continues to increase across the growing base. We recognize the strategic importance of technology-oriented merchant acquiring and are focused on sustainably growing our ISV and e-commerce footprints through both sales and innovation. We continue to see digital momentum, signing more than 80 new direct e-commerce clients for the year and 23 in the fourth quarter alone. E-commerce transactions were up 30% for the year, reflecting the continuing strength of digital commerce globally. Our focus on delivering customer-based digital innovation led to the recent connected commerce announcement, enabling Exxon and Amazon Alexa to team up the gas pump, utilizing voice-based technology. We continue to see significant growth potential in our integrated payments business where our ISV partners grew more than 25% for the year. Importantly, ISV revenue grew by nearly 60% in 2019, and we expect to see continuing strong growth moving forward. Our merchant business also continues to perform well outside the United States, signing Delta Air Lines for acquiring services across several international regions. We also renewed our important merchant JV relationship in January with ICICI, one of India's leading banks, which positions us for further expansion in that important growth market. ZA Bank is one of the first institutions to have been granted a virtual banking license in Hong Kong and has chosen Fiserv to manage its card processing. And Vietcombank, one of Vietnam's leading banks with more than 17 million accounts, went live in January on our flexible and scalable signature international core processing platform. With that, let me turn the call to Frank to provide an update on our integration and synergy progress. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. It's wonderful to be here today, discussing the creation of new Fiserv through best-in-class integration. We are making great progress serving clients, enhancing our growth profile through revenue synergies and moving the needle on cost actions. At the same time, as you can see from our strong 2019 results, we remain focused on profitably growing our existing business to deliver shareholder value. We were excited to start the new decade by being named as a FORTUNE Magazine World's Most Admired Company for the seventh year in a row. This recognition is a testament to the hard work, dedication and commitment of our associates around the world. I'm personally very proud to be part of this team. As you know, we set initial 5-year targets of at least $500 million of revenue synergies and $900 million of cost benefits. The punchline remains that we are highly confident in achieving these targets and continue to identify ways in which we can overachieve in terms of both quantum and timing. We continue to advance a growing list of revenue synergies designed to deliver additional client value and incremental revenue growth. These initiatives represent a solid mix of near- and long-term opportunities, which should enable us to serve clients in a way that will drive enhanced growth and profitability for Fiserv over the next decade. We continue to see better-than-expected results in our bank merchant program for Fiserv account processing clients. We signed 44 new clients in the fourth quarter, more than tripling the signings in Q3, and signed over 50 for the year. We are seeing a good balance between de novo programs and competitive takeaways, which are running about 1/3 of the signings, higher than anticipated at this stage. We exited the year with more than 300 institutions in the pipeline and continue to believe we will exceed the $200 million revenue synergy target for this very important initiative. In addition to bank merchant services, there is a large opportunity to cross-sell solutions around the world where one or both of the original firms has an influential relationships. Examples include CheckFree, Dovetail payment hub, DNA, credit card processing and output solutions. We continue to be bullish on the revenue synergy opportunities emerging from network innovation. The combination of STAR and ACCEL as the third largest debit network in the U.S. provides us with a significant opportunity to differentiate with issuers and merchants. Importantly, we are on track to deliver at least $100 million of revenue synergies in 2020 and are well on track to meet or exceed our initial $500 million revenue target. We are also making excellent progress against our cost synergy objective of at least $900 million. Our initial focus is to streamline our cost structure through enhanced efficiency, increased operational rigor and a significant focus on our $4 billion of annual vendor spend. We attained $46 million of cost synergies in 2019 and are continuing to grow a level of annualized run rate savings. We expect incremental cost synergies of more than $300 million in 2020. And given the combination of visibility and actions to date, also anticipate very strong cost synergy performance in 2021. We are pleased with our performance to date and have increasing confidence in our objective to exceed the original synergy targets over the 5-year period. We will provide a full update of both cost and revenue synergy targets at our March investor conference. Since the time of the transaction announcement, we have gotten questions on how the original Fiserv operational effectiveness program would intersect with the cost synergy program. We see a number of opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, while enhancing our client experience through innovation, such as RPA, cloud and process reengineering, which we believe will also provide additional economic opportunity beyond the cost synergy program. An important 2020 priority is to continue working collaboratively with Bank of America on a joint venture dissolution, which is slated for June 2020. The discussions are progressing very well, and both parties are focused on ensuring the delivery of great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that the financial impact of the BAMS separation will be generally accretive to our results over the next few years. Overall, there's nothing more important than delivering on the promise of new Fiserv. Our unifying purpose across the enterprise is to build an extraordinary company for our clients, associates and shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start off by saying that we feel great about our financial performance and have confidence in our ability to create sustained value for clients and shareholders. Internal revenue growth was 5% as expected in the quarter and 6% for the year. We were pleased to see modest contributions from our revenue synergies which we believe will accelerate to at least $100 million in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.2 billion in the quarter and was up 8% to $4.3 billion for the year, which includes an early contribution from synergies. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points to 31.4%. The improvement was driven by a combination of continued revenue growth, the lapping of prior year's tax reinvestment and the early benefits from synergies, partially offset by the expected lower periodic revenue compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 100 basis points to 29.7%, driven by improved revenue growth, cost efficiencies and a modest impact from early synergy realization. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18% to $1.13 in the quarter and increased 16% to $4 for the year, which also marked our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. These results include a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.11 per share for the quarter and full year, respectively. As you know, we intend to modify our segment structure in 2020, and we'll report our future results on that basis. We expect to file an 8-K in March that will provide the new segments along with comparable financial information on a quarterly basis for 2018 and 2019. Now on to the segments. Internal revenue growth in the First Data segment continued to be strong at 6% in the quarter and 7% for the year. This performance included outstanding results in the former GBS segment delivering 9% growth in the quarter and 10% for the full year. Internal revenue growth in GBS North America was a very solid 6% in both the quarter and year. And as we mentioned in our Q3 call, we don't intend to provide this level of subsegment detail beginning in 2020. Global merchant acquiring, both at the physical point-of-sale and in digital markets, were important contributors to our 2018 growth, with strong performance in India, Brazil and Argentina. Additionally, we saw solid performance in our domestic business, including continuing strength in our digital commerce solutions. Our ISV partners grew by more than 25% for the year, translating to almost 25,000 new ISV merchant locations. Importantly, the number of global contracted merchant locations in 2019 expanded by double digits. We also continue to expand our leadership position in card issuing with worldwide accounts on file up solidly in the mid-single digits for the full year. Segment adjusted operating income increased 6% to $708 million in the quarter, and was up 5% to $2.7 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 50 basis points to 31.9% in the quarter and 30.7% for the year, driven primarily by strong revenue growth. An original Fiserv Payments segment delivered the internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter and 5% for the year, impacted, as expected, in the quarter by lower periodic revenue. We saw strong segment growth performance in card services, output solutions and some early network revenue synergy benefits. Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 12% to $353 million in the quarter and up 11% to $1.3 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was outstanding, up a very strong 250 basis points to 39.2% and was up 70 basis points to 36.3% in the year. This increase was generally from growth in high-quality revenue, the reduction of last year's tax-funded investments and the benefits from productivity and early synergy performance. Transactional businesses performed well with debit transactions up in the high single digits for the quarter and the year, and Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 11% in the quarter to more than $9 million. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, doubling versus Q4 last year and up 18% sequentially. Zelle transactions tripled in 2019, and the number of live clients increased tenfold compared to a year ago. Zelle signings were also very strong for the year, almost doubling to more than 360, which included 112 in the fourth quarter alone. Internal revenue in the financial segment for the quarter was flat as expected, driven by much lower periodic revenue, partially offset by gains in high-quality recurring revenue. For the full year, internal revenue growth was up a solid 3%, led by our account and item processing businesses. Adjusted operating income in the financial segment was flat in the quarter at $207 million and was up 1% to $805 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.1%, with the benefit of growing recurring revenue and operational effectiveness more than offsetting the impact of lower periodic revenue. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 20 basis points to 33.5%, which is the highest level attained in the last several years. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter was flat to the prior year at $100 million and down 11% to $414 million for the full year, primarily due to a combination of cost synergies and operational efficiency benefits in both original companies. The adjusted effective tax rate came in slightly better than expected at 22.8% for the quarter and 21.4% for the year, primarily due to higher-than-expected benefits and stock-based compensation. Due to the transaction close, we expect this benefit to be reduced in 2020 and become a bit of a tax rate headwind, with the largest impact likely in Q1. Accordingly, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Free cash flow of $984 million in the quarter was driven by a combination of strong operating results and some benefit from settlement timing in our merchant business. Full year free cash flow was up a very strong 16% to $3.3 billion, and free cash flow conversion was 118%. We expect to see continued free cash flow benefits from the utilization of the First Data tax NOL in 2020. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $238 million in the quarter and 4.2 million shares for nearly $400 million in the year. We are pleased to have reentered a more regular cadence on share repurchase, which should carry into 2020. As of December 31, we had 680 million shares outstanding and 22 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding, which is about 78% fixed rate, was $21.9 billion, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8x as of December 31. We repaid nearly $600 million of debt in the quarter and remain committed to returning our historic leverage level within 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth. In December, we announced an agreement to sell a 60% interest in our investment services business to Motive Partners. Along with entering into a joint venture, we expect to receive approximately $510 million of net after-tax proceeds from the sale, which will be primarily redeployed to share repurchase. Overall, the net expected dilution from our 4 -- 2019 divestitures should be about $0.05 in 2020. We will continue to use our portfolio management discipline to ensure we have the optimal mix of businesses to deliver sustained client and shareholder value in your company. In conjunction with the First Data merger, we recorded a noncash impairment charge in the GAAP results in the quarter, associated with an international core account plus -- excuse me, core account processing platform. Lastly, using the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, we will have already achieved approximately 25% accretion from the First Data transaction. We will remain on track to meet or exceed our commitment of more than 40% accretion over the 5-year synergy period. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, market momentum continued in Q4 with a 15% increase in sales for the second quarter in a row and with strong performance across several areas, including bank solutions, card services, merchant solutions and biller. The Q4 results are even more noteworthy considering original Fiserv sales results in the comparable period were at a record level. On a combined basis, sales was up 10% for the year, and our pipeline remains strong. We are seeing synergy opportunities grow as the market explores the benefits of new Fiserv, which we believe will lead to incremental revenue growth in 2020 and beyond. For original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 41% sequentially and up 5% for the year. During the fourth quarter, we achieved $11 million of operational effectiveness benefits and $47 million of savings in 2019, which completes our 5-year $250 million program 1 year early. As you know, we provided a preliminary view of 2020 performance in Q3, and our actual 2020 outlook is right in line with that preview. We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, with growth rate acceleration coming from continuing strength in our global merchant business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementations and the achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2020 adjusted earnings per share growth of 23% to 27% or $4.86 to $5.02 off the revised 2019 result of $3.95, which reflects the net divestiture impact Bob mentioned earlier. Our outlook also contains negative FX impact of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share, which is incremental to the decline in 2019. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points, and that free cash flow conversion will be greater than 112% for the year. For modeling purposes, we expect our Q1 results to be pressured by the comparison against last year's strongest quarter, which also had a high level of nonrecurring and periodic revenue. Additionally, we expect revenue growth and earnings to build sequentially throughout the year as action plans are executed and cost and revenue synergies fold into our results. Overall, we expect the quantum of these benefits and the impact to our P&L to be sustainably higher in the second half of the year, which should also provide a strong jumping-off point as we enter 2021. 2019 was a watershed year for Fiserv. We were again named a world's most admired company, achieved our 34th consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth, and most importantly, acquired First Data in a market-defining transaction that significantly advanced our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world. We're excited to enter a new decade of growth and opportunity. We believe we have assembled the strongest, client-centric solutions in the industry, the best associate team and are focused on delivering above-market returns for you, our shareholders. As we close, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world who work relentlessly to serve clients and to deliver Fiserv at our best. With that, Ivy, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue is Brett Huff from Stephens. Brett Huff : Congrats on a nice quarter and a first quarter -- first annual outlook. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Brett. Brett Huff : Just quick questions on -- as we look and kind of enumerate, and Frank, you talk a little bit about this. As you think about the various categories of revenue synergies, you mentioned network synergies card issuing, things like that. If you -- would you order the priority of those for us? And now that you've kind of been at this for 6 months or so and give us a little bit more color on each of those buckets? Frank Bisignano : Well, bank merchant and the merchant opportunity, we would put at the highest level. And you see that performing and how we're signing it up. And when Jeff and I thought about this, we always thought that we would have a strategic advantage with the Clover platform, and I'll create a privileged position in core processing, account processing and along with our deep bank relationships. Second, the bringing together of these 2 networks is a very, very unique opportunity that takes us -- we were already, in some cases, #3, when you put it together, we're a powerful #3. But we have this merchant business that affords our clients opportunity. So you're watching the client-centricity of these opportunities that are good for our shareholders and good for our clients. And then the ability to take the privileged positions both companies had with the long list of assets, output is a very strong product. We know that we can have check free and our payment of Dovetail, all those are very strong opportunities in the cross-sell. And as Jeff talked about, the market reaction is every time we're together with the client, we get this very deep feeling of even more we can do for them. And we look forward to Investor Day to talk more deeply about that. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Brett, I would say, I think Frank is exactly right. The only other thing I would say is, as we continue to have the privilege of spending more time together, we are identifying more and more unique opportunities. We currently have more than 80 different synergy -- revenue synergy opportunities in play, and that list continues to grow. And so the beauty of this is not only do we see opportunities to deliver value, as we've talked about, whether it's in the bank merchant, the network and output, kind of some of the nearer in opportunities, but the ability to drive continuing value through the wonderful solutions and people that we have in the organization, we're increasingly bullish. And again, we'll spend more time on that in March. Brett Huff : That's great. My quick follow-up is the longer -- the bigger picture, longer-term idea of owning both the funding account in the merchant point of sale, that was, I know, one of the things on the list that intrigued you about the combination. As you -- again, as you're 6 months into this, what is your view on that? Has it changed? Has it evolved at all? Gotten more concrete? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Brett. And I would say that it continues to evolve. We believe that there is, again, kind of an even more increased privileged position where you can have access to the transactional account with all of the evolution that's happening in the payment space around real-time money movement, and we continue to see that as a very interesting future opportunity. And that would be incremental to the kinds of opportunity that we see today. And so we're -- we continue to be very excited about that. Operator : Next, David Koning with Baird. David Koning : Great year. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, David. David Koning : Yes, yes. I guess, my first question, when we think of 6% to 8% growth, I mean, it's very encouraging. And is it both segments, both Fiserv and First Data accelerating? Like is Fiserv is going to be 5-ish and First Data 7 to 9? Is that kind of what we should be thinking of? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. So Dave, I would say that that, as Bob talked about, we will be moving away from our traditional segment structure and we'll move to a new segmentation, and we would expect each of those areas to continue to grow. I would say, if you went back to the old, kind of the original structures, we would expect to see our payments, our payments segment have incremental growth, really driven by strength in our digital and mobile capabilities in Zelle, in network, some of those areas. So around card -- sorry, around card processing and on balance. So we would expect that to grow. As we've talked about before, we would expect to see some level of improvement in the traditional financial segment. But as you know, that segment both produces good solid returns and margins on a stand-alone basis, but also does the double duty of being a hub for us to deliver future and integrated value through other solutions, whether it be bank, merchant, card or any of the other capabilities that we have. So a longer answer, but yes, we would expect to see acceleration in each of the different traditional segments on balance. David Koning : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Free cash flow, incredibly strong, over 112%, I think, is what you said you're guiding to. And I know that includes a little bit of NOL. Is there a way to think of what that is without the NOL, maybe on a longer-term basis? Is it still like 105 or something like that? Jeffery Yabuki : I would say, and Bob will certainly add in here. There's no reason to believe that our free cash flow performance will be below what it had been historically, which is in that range, Dave. Robert Hau : Yes, absolutely the right way to look at it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Dave, we've got the NOL benefit repeating, reoccurring in 2020 and have expectation of at least 112%, long-standing above 100% for the company, going back many, many years. I expect to see that going forward. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say, Dave, the only other caveat to keep in mind, and it's not an annual caveat, but it's a quarterly caveat, in that depending on the days at -- the quarter's end and everything else, you could have some merchant settlement moving up and down. So you'll have a little bit more of that between quarters. But on an annual basis, we are absolutely committed to running free cash ahead of normal earnings. Operator : Next, we have Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : I just want to start off, the Q4 results. If you normalize for the periodic revenues you talked about, I guess, what would you -- what kind of impact does that have on the quarter's internal growth of 5%? And then just thinking about the outlook, the 6% to 8% range. I mean what would go right for the top end of that? What do you expect to be? Are you just being conservative for the 6 part of it? Just a little bit more color would be great. Sure. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So if you think about the deal, it's hard to talk about it in terms of the entire business because, obviously, a fair amount of the periodic revenue comes out of the traditional or the original Fiserv business. But in the original Fiserv business, it's kind of a little bit more than 1 point of revenue growth we gave up because of the periodic revenue. And we also have had a drag, most of the year, in our Biller Solutions business, where we had a large client grow over from the prior year. And so those kinds of negatives are running through -- certainly running through Q4 and did have an impact. Again, consistent with what we laid out in Q3, but on an absolute basis, that would have been the case. Going into 2020, we feel really good about where we sit. We had 15% sales growth in Q4. We had 15% sales growth in Q3. And one of the great things about that is we were worried what might happen when the market frees up. And what we saw is very strong growth. And so that 30% growth in the last 6 months of the year, we'll start to see some of that roll in. And one of the levers that you could move us up on the continuum is faster implementations, faster growth of those clients. As you know, almost all of our clients end up ramping up. I think the other thing would be, do we see higher levels of performance outside the U.S. than we're planning for today. I think that could move us up, move us up on the continuum. And I think the last thing would be faster realization of revenue synergies. And so as Frank talked about, whether it's bank merchant, network output, those kinds of areas could all conspire to have higher growth kind of move us up to the top end. But nothing has changed from where we sat at Q3. We think this range is prudent, but our perspective is still the same as it was in Q3. Darrin Peller : All right. That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. The 40% growth in Clover, I mean, that continues to be extremely strong. And is that still just the organic trend of follow-through from what First Data has already built? Or are you starting to see some benefit from cross-selling through the Fiserv banks or any other cross-sell on that front? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, yes. Thanks, Darrin. I would say that there has been exactly no impact on the Clover GPV growth. In fact, each of the quarters for the year, Clover grew above 40%, really stellar performance and an annualized run rate in excess of $100 billion. So we feel quite good about that. And while we're excited about the progress that we made on bank merchant, there's really been no contribution yet. And really, I don't think we'll start to see any movement and contribution until the second half of next year. And even that will take time to ramp, as you've seen it up in Clover. Historically, for the great work that Frank and the team has done, but we do believe that's going to be a meaningful, meaningful tailwind to growth over the next several years. Operator : Next, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : As you sit down with your bank and credit union CEOs to discuss 2020 spending priorities, first, what would you characterize as the top spending priorities for your bank and credit union clients? How does your solution set match up against those? And then number two, how would you characterize the overall demand environment for 2020 in the core Fiserv financial sector based upon your conversations with bank and credit union CEOs? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Thanks, David. I would say that the priorities for financial institutions in the U.S. are continuing as they were. I would say, everything digital, whether it is on the consumer side, the small business side and the commercial side, that's really job one. Continuing to make the institutions more efficient through straight-through processing, right? Digital really requires a straight-through processing. We're seeing a lot of discussion around money movement. Frank made reference to the Dovetail payments hub as one of the interesting cross-sell opportunities that we have as a result of the combination. And that's really illustrative of modernizing the back office. So we continue to see that as an important priority. And then third, I would say it's all about cyber, making sure that banks are doing everything they can to solidify their position around safety and soundness, right, which is instrumental to the banking system. So I would say those will be the top 3 priorities. We're also seeing some modernization going on behind the scenes around the infrastructure that's required to operate in a digital, kind of, think about a digital real-time 24/7 world, but that is still secondary to the first 3 items that we talked about. So that trend continues. We think we are very well positioned in what we are doing today around digital. We've been talking about it for a while, whether it's around mobility, our architect solution, it's helping to reenergize the account processing, the core banking space, both in the bank and credit union side. We're making a lot of progress in our security solutions and some of our other solutions that are around safety and soundness. So again, good progress there. And third, like payments have been a big deal for us, and so we continue to make progress overall. I would say that on balance, the spend environment, if you would have asked me 6 months ago, given where interest rates were moving, I would have thought that we would see a more muted spend environment. The spend environment has actually held up. I think part of it is we're getting used to a lower spread world, and banks realize they have to continue to spend. You, of course, are seeing discretionary spending being pulled from places that may not be in the top priorities. But on balance, we remain bullish going into 2020 on the spend front with that segment of the base, including the synergy work, bank merchant and other areas. We're bullish and optimistic going into the year. Operator : Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the competitive takeaways, specifically on the merchant services cross-selling into the banks. What -- how can you kind of characterize the sort of secret ingredient to picking off those relationships? Is it Clover? Is it more just focused sales attention? Is it bundling with other services? Like what's giving you the sort of torque in those negotiations in order to sort of pick up customers? Jeffery Yabuki : So I would say that we have, for years, talked about the importance of the core processing as a hub to a strategically privileged relationship. And so I would say, at the top of the house is that relationship that we have with clients. However, it's really been complemented beautifully by the technological innovation that Clover brings to the party and offers banks an opportunity to bring Apple-like innovation to their commercial clients, to their small businesses. So from that perspective, those 2 items have been very important. Thirdly, because of the privileged position we have, we've been driving deeper integration, integration into digital capability, integration into commercial cash management. And if -- we're working on innovation into our notify a learning hub. We're working on innovation that's going to allow banks to have deeper relationships with these small businesses and commercial customers. So from that perspective, I would say that combination is what's allowed us to get off to such a good start, both, as Frank talked about, in the de novo space as well as in the competitive space. So on balance, good, and we're also seeing -- I would have anticipated or I did anticipate that we would see smaller banks take the lead. And while they have almost 20% of the conversions are institutions that are greater than $1 billion of assets. So from that perspective, we feel good about the place and the reaction from the market. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That's super helpful. And then in light of some of the recent divestiture activity, how would you describe the collection of assets that you have now under the combined companies? Is it sort of where you want it to be? Or should we expect kind of a steady stream of incremental divestitures as we move forward? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Ramsey, we're still in the process of reviewing strategic fit and really making sure that we have the bandwidth to put effort into some of these businesses. So if you take the investment services business, which was the -- obviously, the large divestiture we announced in the fourth quarter, that's -- we think that's a fantastic business. We think with the right leadership and the right capital that, that is a wonderful business, which is why we kept 40% of the business. But we believe that needed additional management and the opportunity cost for us was too great given everything we have that Bob and Frank and I have been talking about. So from that perspective, that was important. I would say that while you may see us do some trimming over time, we don't -- I don't -- we're not sitting here with a list of big divestitures that are coming. We're really looking, and we like our portfolio a lot. I think we talked about it. We think we actually have the best solution set in the industry in terms of growth capability, but really, most important, around client centricity and the ability to move our clients forward with our solutions. Operator : Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities. Jeffrey Cantwell : Jeff, you just touched on this, but I wanted to ask you on something about what you're seeing right now on the Fiserv side of the platform. And clearly, we seem to -- we've made a number of moves over the past couple of years, which you've positioned Fiserv quite well to capture market share. And so I was just wondering if you could frame something for us. Where are you seeing the most significant change in client demand over time? Is it coming to you from smaller financial situations? Is it coming from midsized FIs? Maybe it's coming from larger FIs? I was just curious if you can help us figure that out because we're really just trying to figure out who's capturing share in each of the buckets, looking at it like that, so it would be great if you could give us your thoughts on where you think you're taking share. I appreciate it. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. That's a really interesting question. I would say that we are taking share on balance in the areas where we have market strength. And I use that descriptor because it's less about, is it in the small end of the base or in the large end of the base? So when I say the base, I mean the market, sorry. And instead, it's in places where we have solution strength that delivers value for clients. So if you are a small e-commerce merchant or a very large e-commerce merchant, and I think we indicated we signed roughly 80 new e-commerce logos during the year, some of those are smaller, and some of them are very important household names that we're all familiar with. And so what we're seeing is more consistency around the decision making that's being made in the market. So really looking for quality more than any segment will accept something that is in quality. So from that perspective, whether it be a solution like CheckFree RXP or Dovetail or our ISV solution, or e-commerce solution or Clover, you're seeing choices be made based on the quality of the solution. As it relates to kind of deeper into the segments, I would say I feel right now across the enterprise that we're doing well, gaining share in the places that matter to us strategically. And that we're well positioned to continue to do that, especially as we bring things together. Probably the most important trend that we're seeing is, if you think about the -- below the top 60 or 70 banks, you're just continuing to see more move towards outsourcing, right? We have fantastic capabilities as an outsourcer that got even better through our combination with First Data. And so we're seeing more and more capability. In fact, some of the more interesting opportunities that we have synergistically are, in fact, bringing things together with solutions that the original Fiserv had that we didn't offer on a hosted or ASP basis. Jeffrey Cantwell : Great. I appreciate that. And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're growing by 25% in integrated, if I heard that correctly, which certainly sounds strong. So could you talk to us a little more about that? Maybe tell us what's driving that? And also about the -- maybe a little bit about the go-forward picture for yourselves in integrated? I'm just curious as to whether there's any specific verticals, for example, where you're seeing the strongest momentum and how sustainable you feel that growth is overall. Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Jeff, let me quickly give you the data, and then I think Frank can add a little bit more color on that. In the ISV, the integrated payment space, I think we said, we increased the number of ISV merchants by 25%, and transaction growth was -- or sorry, revenue growth was up 60, right? So a very strong year in that space. We continue to make it a priority kind of taking on the way First Data that Frank and his team had done. We see lots of opportunity to grow. But let me have Frank give a little bit more color on that. Frank Bisignano : Yes. In ISV, it's a very -- as Jeff said in the earlier points, a very technical product. It is not a vertical attempt here. There's not a look at 1 single vertical. It's really across, and it's really a technology solution. So I feel very comfortable that our solution plays in all spaces, and we are winning across all spaces from car washes to retailers of different sizes and shapes. So it's not a vertical-specific capability. Jeffrey Cantwell : Congrats on the results. Jeffery Yabuki : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask about the Fiserv stand-alone. I know Fiserv started the year guiding to 4.5% to 5% internal revenue growth, but there's been some moving pieces with divestitures, and obviously, acquisitions came in. So just hoping to get a report card on how Fiserv stand-alone did versus original expectations? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, thanks, Bryan. I would say that on balance, it was probably slightly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year. The comparables are a little bit more difficult because of -- upon the combination, we made some changes that had an impact to some of the revenue recognition, and therefore, some of the growth. So we had some impact there. But I would say, on balance, slightly less than we would have expected. I would also say that when we closed in July, we've made a series of decisions around allocating resources to places that we didn't have in our sights originally. And so from our perspective, we thought it was most important to make sure that we were getting the integration right, that we are focused on laying the track for synergies, both on the cost and on the revenue side. And then third, just making sure that we're continuing to invest and have these capabilities ready to drive more growth this year, which we think they will. Bryan Keane : Got it. Got it. Helpful. And then I wanted to ask on the adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 250 basis points. How much of that is from the core companies versus the synergies? Is there a way to break that out? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, Bryan. I would say that we're doing everything in our power to make sure that we're running the company on a kind of a combined single view. But the reality is, I think we said in our prepared remarks, that we expected at least $300 million of cost synergies this year. And so therefore, a large part of the unusual gain in margin is going to come from that. I will also tell you that embedded in that are investments that we are making that are required to drive revenue synergies that are kind of consuming some of the gains in margin. So that $300 million is not a net number of all of the investments we have to make. But again, to get to your exact question, a large part of that would be coming from the synergies. But we, as a normal entity, would continue to do the things that we would do to drive margin. If you think about original Fiserv, greater than 50 basis points per year. Bryan Keane : Right, right. And just to be clear, the $300 million in cost synergies, is that up from previous expectations? Jeffery Yabuki : We have never guided in any year. We've said we expected to do $900 million over 5 years. And so we did $46 million -- I think we did $46 million in the first 5 months that we were a combined company. We've said in our prepared remarks, we'd do at least $300 million this year. So we'll -- after 17 months, we'll be roughly at least $346 million. Bryan Keane : Okay. Helpful. Looking forward to the Analyst Day. Jeffery Yabuki : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to follow-up on -- I think it was Darrin's question earlier, just on the outlook for the 2020 organic. I think last quarter, you'd said at least 7%. Now we're refining it maybe around the edges a little bit. And I guess, 6% is in the equation here. Just any particular reason why 6% is part of the guidance? Because it kind of sounds like you're thinking that the high end, the 8% is a lot more likely than the low end at 6%, but just wanted to understand the nuance there in terms of how the commentary evolved incrementally from last quarter? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So thanks, Jason. I would say, and I tried to make this point clear in the prepared remarks, that nothing has changed from our preliminary view that we gave in Q3. We continue to be confident in the numbers that we provided. We do believe it's prudent to have a range that is -- that encompasses kind of 2 percentage points. And therefore, we thought 6% to 8% made sense. The center point is not accidentally 7%. And so we feel good about where we are. And 7% is a very healthy gain over where we ended this year. And we feel like we -- if we execute well, and we believe we will, that we will not only increase our internal revenue growth rate this year, but we will be well positioned jumping off into 2021 given our commentary about how synergies will lay in and stronger performance in the second half of the year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Digital distribution initiatives for Clover, any metrics you might be able to share there in terms of the percent of new activations that are maybe coming through digital channels now versus through physical bank branches? And how that mix is kind of evolving? I know that was a big focus for First Data heading into the merger. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say, we still are very bullish on digital distribution as an opportunity for us. And we actually think that opportunity grew in the combination of Fiserv and First Data because of the fact that we now have, not only more digital distribution points through the cash management and retail, digital capabilities of the banks and credit unions that we will sign up, and the ability to be more targeted on the data that we would use. So we continue to believe that all makes sense. However, I would say that as we sit here today, the results of digital are quite low, probably immeasurable relative to the successes that we have had in other parts of the business. And so we will continue to grow that. And that the results, at least for the next couple of years, are not contingent on us dramatically increasing digital distribution. We see that to be a journey. We're early in the journey, and we'll continue to work it and knock it down. Operator : Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Jeff, a lot of good stuff in terms of where you're investing and where do you think the sweet spot is. And I just wonder if I could get your perspective. On sort of the competitive environment, there are a few things, I think, that have emerged of late. Temenos launched a new solution for neobanks, a SaaS-based solution. We saw the Worldline-Ingenico deal yesterday. We saw BigCommerce tap Barclaycard for payments, also the rest of world development for the most part, maybe Temenos domestic. I just wonder, you kind of kicked off this consolidation trend and now it seems like there are some new entrants. Can you just frame up your strengths and investment priorities against the competitive backdrop? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. It's a great question. We -- I'm not sure we can take credit for kicking off this entire trend, but I do think we can take credit... Andrew Jeffrey : You were first, though. Jeffery Yabuki : Well, thank you. But I do think we can take credit for understanding between Frank and me and the rest of our team that the world was changing, and that we felt like getting on the train early would be good for -- good for us, good for our clients and obviously, good for our shareholders. And so the things that are happening right now are generally consistent with what we would have expected in terms of the overall transformation. When we think about this transformation that's going on, we see some things happening around the fringes. We see people coming together to create more -- in some cases, more capacity to invest, in some cases, more unique partnerships, all of that recognizing the change that's going on. And it's part of why we earmarked $500 million in incremental innovation to make sure that not only did -- could we generate a significant amount of free cash flow so that we could allocate that to acquisitions and other inorganic uses of capital, but that we would be very focused on investing while we are restructuring and reshaping the company for the future. So we actually take a fair amount of comfort in the things that are going on in the market because they do confirm for us that the world is changing. And I think you will see us look for our inherent competitive advantages. So we think we have a treasure trove of data. And so whether it's around fraud or better authorization rates or better ability to know your customer, better ability to make decisions on the basis of transactional data, we think that's quite important, investing in advancing our e-commerce capabilities, whether it is some of the voice that we talked about today, but really leveraging the unique strengths that we have because we have the ability to take advantage of the platforms that we're operating today and making them better. So whether it is moving to the cloud or using AI and RPA as ways to get there faster, we have all of that. We have all of that capability. We're quite excited to do it, and I think we'll be able to share some of that in March. But I do think we're going to continue to see announcements that talk to the fact that the world is changing, and it's incumbent upon us to make sure we're staying in front of that change but really focused on the areas where we have strong competitive positions and that will make us stronger. Operator : George Mihalos from Cowen. Georgios Mihalos : Just had a follow-up question as it relates to the ISV channel and all the progress you're making there. Appreciate the commentary on the revenue growth being up, I think, 60%, you said. But can you actually size that business for us in terms of revenue dollars? I think the last time that First Data did that was back in 2018, when I think it was around $50 million or so. Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, I would say, George, that compared to the $14.5 billion or so of revenue that we have, it's certainly a small -- it's certainly on a relatively small base. But that relatively small base is growing quite comfortably, and we're excited about that. And we're also excited about using some of the different -- sorry, the competitively differentiated services that they have across other parts of the ecosystem. So it's, again, a relatively small base, but growing in a very, very nice clip. And as you know, the space on balance relative to merchant acquiring globally is still quite small. Georgios Mihalos : Yes. Appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item for Bob. The $0.05 of dilution from the investment services majority sale, that is net of the $500 million being redeployed in buyback, right? Robert Hau : Yes, that's correct. But more importantly, that's actually an aggregation of 4 divestitures in total. So investment services being part of that. But yes, the capital redeployment is included in that calculation. Operator : And Chris Shutler with William Blair. Christopher Shutler : Just one quick one. Really good sales numbers. Again, the 10% for the year. Would you confirm that, that is an annual contract value, not TCV? And if so, could you give us the comparable numbers for the last couple of years? I think you previously reported it on a TCV basis? Jeffery Yabuki : Yes, you're right, Chris. And we have changed our methodology to align with how First Data had talked about in reported sales. And so -- but I -- we have not talked about the quantum. We've always only talked about percent growth. But I would say that, that percent growth is, obviously, up 10% for the year, but importantly, up 30% over the last 6 months. Operator : Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Jeff, I wanted to just ask a little bit about the First Data SMB portfolio, especially in the U.S. I know, Frank, in the past, you've talked about the attrition or retention rate of that portfolio. And I'm just wondering where it stands today and just your opportunity to maybe improve the yield in that portfolio? Frank Bisignano : Yes. As you probably remember, the long journey that we took, but today, we're in a much different place than when we started on the journey. I think we talk about being a gainer of share and growing our portfolio here. And I think when you look at what attrition rates have done versus when we first started on it, they're practically in half. So we are a much different portfolio than when I talked to you years ago. And I think you see it in the growth of the merchant numbers that we have in total. Jeffery Yabuki : And I think, Kartik, one of the things that's interesting when you dig in and look at the data, is you -- not only is Clover really an attractive vehicle in the acquiring market, but the fact is that we see better retention. And the beauty there is it's a platform, right? So we have add-on services that we talk about. So better retention, more services, happier clients. So it really is both sides, and it's one of the things that the First Data team, the original First Data team, had done quite well. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last one, Jeff. Just as far as capital -- use of capital is concerned, I know you said going back to buying back shares. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on repaying debt in 2020 or maybe if you have a goal -- something in mind for the debt for the company as we end this year? Jeffery Yabuki : So Kartik, I would say that we've been very consistent since the time we announced that we were going into this transformative combination that we would repay debt and grow EBITDA at a healthy clip to get our debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to our historic levels, and I think we said we would do that over an 18- to 24-month period. We ended the year at 3.8x. Bob paid down $600 million of debt in the fourth quarter. And so we'll continue to move down that path. The good news is, is we were able to move back to our programmatic buying at the very beginning of the fourth quarter. And so we think we have the firepower to do both. And certainly, we'll meet our commitments to the agencies. Operator : Next, we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : I think you mentioned that you've signed 80 new direct-to-merchant e-com wins for the year and 23 in the fourth quarter alone. This isn't a metric that First Data historically reported. So is this kind of growth a change from the historic win rates on direct-to-merchant e-comm? And if so, I assume it is. What are you doing differently? And do you -- are you executing against a specific strategy to diversify away from processing for PayFac and going more direct to merchant in that business? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure, Lisa. Thanks. I would say that while we have not -- while we have not shared that metric previously, as you know well, we think it's important that people understand that not only do we have strength through our very important joint venture partners, but that on a direct basis, we are able to win business worldwide. And we think the fact that we won 80 logos for the year, and this is 80 new logos to the firm, which I think is quite important, again, 24 in Q4, a range -- granted a range of size of merchants, but some very important names. So from that perspective, I would say it's a continuation of the strategy that Frank and his team started, but we have been putting more -- and what I mean me, I mean, the collective company -- just putting more focus and energy. Part of it is having a stronger technology platform, part of it is more focused on innovation, part of it is more sales-focused, part of it is better service to existing clients. And so it's the entire gamut that Frank and the team started. We're continuing to make it a high priority, as you and I have discussed. E-commerce and technology-based acquiring on balance is a very high priority for the company, just like SMBs and everything else, but obviously, this space is important. And being a consistent share gainer is our absolute objective. Lisa Dejong Ellis : And then maybe my quick follow-up. On the issuer processing business is realizing they're still sort of split in the current reporting across a couple of different segments. Can you just provide a little bit of color on how the combined issuer processing businesses are doing and specifically combined revenue growth trajectory and how you're tracking so far on the synergies that you've been expecting across those 2 businesses as well, both domestically and internationally? Jeffery Yabuki : Sure. So Lisa, I would say that it probably will make more sense to cover this in-depth in a little bit more depth in March. But at a high level, we are not -- we have not combined our respective original issuer processing businesses. They run different platforms, they're different value propositions. We are looking to combine capabilities and move them more ubiquitously across platforms where it makes sense. We're looking to make sure that we have the right clients on the right platforms where it makes sense. And so we like the fact that we now, both sides of the original organizations, have more tools in the tool chest to go out and serve clients and win business. I would say that, that on the traditional, the original First Data issuer processing business, specifically on the credit side, we're seeing some really interesting opportunities in the market. It's one of the places that you will see us invest kind of in thinking about more as next-gen capabilities there. So very important, specifically on the credit side. And also, we're seeing a better-than-anticipated responsiveness in the Fiserv original clients, both domestically and internationally in providing those kinds of capabilities, whether they be more integrated into the core systems in the U.S., but outside the U.S., sold into our larger signature or other relationships, we're seeing that to be a little bit better than we would have expected at this point. Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. We're excited for the future. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great evening. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line, and have a great day or a great evening.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Thank you. You may begin. Peter Poillon : Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter, which includes slides on our updated revenue and cost synergy targets announced in March, are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the first quarter of 2019 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. To say we are living in interesting times is an understatement. As an example, Bob and I are here in Milwaukee, appropriately social distanced; Frank and Peter are joining from separate locations in New York; and many of you are likely at home. We are all adapting to this transitory time as we approach a new normal. We're incredibly proud of how the Fiserv team has responded, protecting your company while executing on our number one priority, keeping associates and clients safe. We activated our business continuity plan quickly, starting in Asia and continued around the world. Today, about 85% of our associates are working remotely, and the remainder are following rigorous safety protocols to protect the health of the team. Additionally, hourly associates whose jobs cannot be performed remotely have received a 25% increase in pay while we navigate the COVID crisis. We are supporting clients by providing them with the leading-edge solutions they need to serve their customers. Our account sales and service teams are adjusting the changes required in this new world, including travel by tech, connecting with clients through individual and team-based video capabilities. The substantial majority of our implementations are progressing as scheduled, and sales in the quarter held up reasonably well, coming in just shy of the prior year. We entered Q2 with a solid pipeline. And in fact, our preliminary sales results for April were up more than 20% over the prior year. We have a strong, resilient business model, which is buttressed by the delivery of mission-critical solutions to financial institutions, corporate clients and merchants around the world. We also believe leadership matters. And having more than our fair share of experienced executives who have successfully navigated the global financial and economic events of the last 30 years will contribute to even stronger results as we navigate these changing economic times. In early March, we communicated meaningful increases to our five year synergy targets, including a 20% increase in revenue to at least $600 million. And on the cost side, we increased our target by $300 million to a total of $1.2 billion which, as you will recall, does not include our sizable interest expense benefits. From day one, we believe that our significant synergies would help mitigate the potential adverse impacts of a recession. In addition to the quantum, we are intently focused on the speed to attain those synergies, all of which Frank will discuss later. The financial results for the first 10 weeks of the year were quite strong, even with some limited weakness outside the U.S. The last two weeks of the quarter got progressively worse as shelter-in-place and other restrictions ramped up around the world. The majority of the business displayed resilience with the largest negative impact in the merchant business, along with pressure in our debit-oriented transaction businesses not seen in previous downturns. The circumstances also spurred some incremental growth across several areas, including payments and digital. Global merchant transactions are generally on the upswing with some variability by country but with meaningful improvements from the lows seen in late March and early April. In the U.S., we've seen early signs of recovery in later April and May to date with comparative transactions down in the low double digits after declining nearly 30% in the last week of March. Since then, we've been seeing continuing, gradual improvement in merchant transaction recovery including into May. U.S. debit transactions were pressured but also showed improvement in the second half of April, finishing the month with low double-digit declines, a substantial improvement from the approximately 20% drop we saw in the last week of March and into early April. Overall, we are quite optimistic about the improvement we are seeing in the current trends and believe we will see further acceleration as shelter-in-place restrictions are eased in the U.S. and around the world. Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we are withdrawing our previously communicated 2020 financial outlook. Consistent with the trends we have seen, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2's results and anticipate improvements throughout the second half of the year. Given the strength and resilience of our business model, including the significant synergy opportunities, we see a solid, actionable path to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth again this year. You will recall that we had expected our first quarter's results to be the weakest of the year due to a difficult compare and the ramping of synergies throughout the year. Given that, along with the impact of COVID-19, we produced solid results, including internal revenue growth of 4%, adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 16% and free cash flow increasing to $760 million for the quarter. Our capital allocation strategy was in full force, including closing the sale of a 60% interest in Investment Services, adding to our merchant capabilities through two small acquisitions and repurchasing 8.6 million shares in the quarter. Importantly, we are making excellent progress on integration with a focus on value creation across strategic, operational and financial fronts. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses continue to expand, adding 12 new clients in the quarter, including five on DNA, such as Jeanne D'Arc Credit Union in Massachusetts with $1.5 billion in assets; and Nelnet, an existing output solutions client that selected DNA to support its mission of helping students make their educational dreams possible. Clover gross payment volume started strong, up 40% through February and despite the COVID hit, still ended up 29% for the quarter. Clover devices shipped was up about 25%. And the adoption of add-on software services such as virtual terminal and our new order ahead functionality continues to expand rapidly across the base. We saw important momentum in e-commerce, adding 36 new direct clients globally, including Total Wine & More, the country's largest independent retailer of fine wine; the U.S. Army Installation Management Command; USA Technologies; and Regis Salons, the largest hair salon chain in the world. We also added the German grocery chain Tegut; and MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's largest consumer electronics retail chain with over 1,000 stores in 14 countries. E-commerce transactions remained strong in the quarter, up 26% in the U.S. and 20% globally, reflecting our market position and opportunity in digital commerce. Our integrated payments value proposition also continued to expand, growing partners more than 20% in the quarter. Impressively, ISV revenue grew more than 55% even in the face of late March weakness. We continue to see strong opportunities to grow in this important space. Overall, total contracted merchant locations globally grew 12% in the quarter. We also had very strong Zelle results, implementing eight times more clients in Q1 compared to the prior year and payment volumes skyrocketed, up nearly 90% in the quarter, and we saw even stronger growth in the second half of April as people look for new ways to pay in this new environment. We continue to see a significant value creation opportunity at the intersection of cards, DDA-based payments and our merchant scale around the world. Importantly, we remain fully committed to deploying our $500 million innovation investment. We've identified important opportunities in areas such as enterprise digital, card, merchant e-commerce, ISV and Clover. We also see expanded opportunities across the data horizon, including risk fraud and decisioning with a specific emphasis on authorization rates, network innovation and next-generation integration. We will continue to invest in 2020 and over the next several years to ensure that we are focused on where the market is going and what we need to do to win. Lastly, as you have seen, we announced our CEO succession plan earlier today, which elects Frank Bisignano to succeed me on July 1. I will serve as Executive Chairman for the remainder of the year, working closely with Frank to ensure a smooth transition. We will also work closely together to continue advancing our longer-term strategy, which will be heavily based on the well-honed capital allocation discipline which is embedded in the DNA of the company. Given my 15-year tenure, the Board and I have been engaged in deep succession planning conversations for a number of years. It has been my long-held belief that organizations benefit from changes in leadership and have used that principle to maintain a fresh approach over my time at Fiserv including, most recently, through the First Data acquisition. My conviction has gotten even stronger given the current pandemic and resultant need to manage and lead differently. Frank will bring new energy and perspective to the company while fully embracing the strategic foundation of Fiserv's value creation playbook. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Frank over the last 18 months, and it will be two years since the announcement when I ultimately depart. In addition to the things that you know such as Frank being an accomplished executive with vast experience in large, complex organizations, including doing a fantastic job as CEO of First Data, he's further established himself with our team, leading our businesses and integration, exceeding goals on our synergies and working closely with me to establish the foundation for our future success. The Board and I feel great about Frank, and he has our unanimous support as Fiserv's next CEO, only the first fourth person in our 36-year history. I'm incredibly happy for Frank and his family and offer my heartfelt congratulations to him as a business partner and my friend. It has been an honor and privilege to lead your company for what now amounts to one-four of my life. Over that time, we have transformed Fiserv into a global leader in payments and fintech and have been named the world's most admired company for seven consecutive years, all while building a sustaining culture of delivering differentiated value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. My primary objective has been to leave the company stronger than when I found it. And while some might say we accomplished that objective, I firmly believe that the best days for Fiserv lie ahead. With that, let me turn the call to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon. And I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed these 18 months and how much I look forward to all the things we're going to do right here in the future. So first of all, let me say how honored I am to be elected the next CEO at Fiserv, a company with a great history and a bright future. My thanks to Jeff for his partnership and leadership to create one of the world's most admired companies. Jeff's vision for a company which invests for the future growth and allocates capital for the benefit of shareholders is the platform from which the company will continue to execute. This strategy will continue to serve our shareholders, associates and clients extremely well for the long term. We have jointly assembled a world-class team that will continue to drive innovation and excellence, allowing us to be known as the greatest fintech on the planet. I greatly appreciate Jeff and the Board's confidence in me leading the company. I feel privileged and tremendously humbled to serve our clients, our communities, our shareholders and this great company. Now on to business. A lot has changed since our last call. And while we've made great progress on integration, we have put even more focus on ensuring business continuity, protecting the health and safety of our associates and delivering on client commitments in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The team has come together beautifully. And I am incredibly proud of the company. As Jeff mentioned, Fiserv was well prepared to serve our clients through a well-tested and robust business continuity plan and an experienced and seasoned leadership team. A crisis waits for no one, whether moving 40,000 people to remote work environments, securing over 200 global locations, proactively managing credit risk or introducing alternative ways for merchant acceptance. Urgency, certainty and expertise are critical ingredients to a successful outcome. Delivering value to our clients is why we exist. Over the past several weeks, COVID has presented a number of unique opportunities to serve clients with speed, agility and innovation. Let me provide a few examples of how our solutions are helping our clients navigate these uncharted waters. Through both our Clover platform and our financial institution clients, we've processed tens of thousands of loans to enable small businesses to share in PPP funding. We are enabling a variety of expedited use cases through our MoneyNetwork prepaid card solution, including supporting the National Institute of Health's C19 research project and enabling not-for-profits to provide funds for those in need. In Argentina, we're working closely with government-owned banks to enable the distribution of benefit and subsidy payments. We've partnered with NIC to offer a walk-in bill payment services across 28 states to enable payments outside of government offices. Through our SpendTrend solution, we are providing proprietary data and insights to merchants, financial institutions and governments to enhance the understanding of economic implications across business segments and geographies. At Clover, we expedited the delivery of our new order-ahead capability which, since launch in early April, is already being used by nearly 1,800 restaurants. As Jeff mentioned, implementations have generally continued as scheduled as technology agendas for our clients remain very important. One terrific example, using a virtual team's approach. MONETA Money Bank in the Czech Republic recently completed a full migration of the bank's credit and debit card portfolios to our outsourced FirstVision service during a full quarantine period. MONETA Money Bank highlights the new ways to deliver great service, which are emerging in this challenging time. Our focus now, more than ever, is to consistently deliver high-value services. Our engagement model is at an all-time high with an enhanced focus on daily client service requests and prioritizing resources. In March, we communicated significant increases of our synergy targets, moving the cost side up by one-three from $900 million to $1.2 billion or roughly 12% of our total cost base. We also took our revenue synergy target up 20% by $100 million to $600 million over the five year period. While we are pleased with the progress to date, the synergy work is not complete. We remain fully committed to unlocking additional opportunity where possible, across both revenue and cost pools as we work toward being the best fintech and payment company on the planet. The enhanced cost synergies include additional opportunities in vendor efficiencies, contractor replacements, infrastructure and operational leverage. First, we've had great results working with our vendor partners to identify cost efficiencies for the combined company as well as acquiring new capabilities, which will have the dual benefit of avoiding internal investment and reducing capex. As a result, we have increased our expectations on procurement, primarily in technology, by about $200 million. Second, we expect to achieve additional synergy benefits from shifting original First Data's outsourced offshore operations to original Fiserv's captive. The primary savings are from converting third-party contractors, which generates cost arbitrage, improve operational efficiency and most important, no loss of knowledge as we rebadge existing third-party resources. Last, we're identifying even more savings from the consolidation of real estate, data centers and back-office systems. We've also had success extending the sophisticated call center operations of original First Data, including an AI-based virtual agent and enhanced self-service capabilities, all geared to meaningfully improve the overall experience. We have also packaged these capabilities to help supplement our clients while delivering revenue for us. We are moving more quickly to accelerate cost synergy timing as a way to offset some of the coronavirus revenue pressure. Our original expectation was more than $300 million this year. We now expect $500 million of full year synergy savings with an annualized exit rate of more than $700 million entering 2021. We feel great about our progress, and we'll continue to look for ways to add even more value. As we mentioned, on the revenue side, we raised our initial target 20% or $100 million, based primarily on anticipated outperformance in bank merchant and new opportunities in areas such as digital disbursements, payment innovation and much stronger momentum outside the U.S. than we expected. We are seeing continued strength in linking the account processing privilege relationships with our market-leading Clover solution to create unique value for our clients. To that end, we signed 55 new bank merchant clients in the quarter, with 42 of those wins through the end of February. We've now signed 109 new FI clients since the start of the program with competitive takeaways at about 40% and an even higher percentage in the larger bank space. Although sales activity has slowed due to the COVID disruption, interest remains very high with nearly 400 institutions in the pipeline. While we expect the current environment will moderate the pace of near-term revenue realization, we have raised our current expectation 15% to $230 million. In addition, we also signed another 16 institutions to our bank merchant program outside of our synergy efforts over the period, not including the expansion of nonbank partners. Although we have recalibrated the expected timing of our revenue synergies given the current economic situation, we are still expecting $75 million to $100 million of revenue synergy in 2020. Our integration is building an organization that will sustainably provide unique value. This is a critical time for the market. And we believe Fiserv, with highly differentiated market-leading solutions, is the best place for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now let me pass the call to Bob for a review of our financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our results utilizing our new reportable segment structure included on the 8-K filed on April 1. We have three business segments. Merchant Acceptance, which we may refer to as acceptance or merchant, is primarily the global merchant acquiring business of original First Data. Financial Technology, or fintech, comprises original Fiserv's core account processing businesses, along with digital banking, financial and risk management and other software-oriented solutions. And finally, Payments and Network, or payments, is the most blended segment between the original companies and is primarily global debit, credit and prepaid card issuer processing, print and card production services and electronic payment services such as bill payment, biller and Zelle. As you heard, the company had a very strong performance through mid-March, well above our original expectations, and even with the significant decline in the last two weeks, still achieved 4% internal revenue growth. The results are even better when considering that result was against our most difficult quarterly comparison as Q1 2019 included a high level of nonrecurring and periodic revenue. Revenue synergies were a strong $27 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating income, which includes the grow over impact of the Investment Services Transaction, increased 1% to $968 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin up 10 basis points to 27.8%. Operating margin was lower than anticipated due to the sharp decline in revenue in the second half of March and expected lower onetime and periodic revenue, partially offset by about $90 million of expense synergies in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $0.99 compared to the $0.85 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services Transaction that closed this quarter. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very solid 6% for the quarter. These results were buoyed by our geographical breadth, diverse industry verticals and broad payment capabilities. North America internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter after being up double digits through February. Our international business grew 7% on a constant currency basis, even as COVID impacts were seen in Asia and Europe earlier in Q1. We continue to make great progress on the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture. Consistent with our internal revenue growth methodology, beginning this quarter, we are excluding the 51% share of BAMS acquiring revenue from our internal revenue growth calculation due to the planned dissolution at the end of June. We will incorporate our new direct BAMS revenue as we would in any acquired business beginning one year post the close of the transaction. We look forward to continuing to serve this important client. Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment decreased 17% to $283 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 440 basis points to 21.2%. Two issues drove the unusual margin decline, led by roughly 270 basis point headwind, primarily related to the very sharp COVID volume decline at quarter's end, with roughly two-three of that amount from our higher growth international business. Next, the comparative negative impact of brand assessment fees, along with the expiration of a 10-year deferred revenue item in BAMS, which ended in Q2 last year, pushed margin down by another 200 basis points. Although we were able to outgrow the revenue decline in March, the resulting mix changed, served to compress operating performance in the quarter. We anticipate the segment operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2 due to the COVID-19 impacts. The Payments and Network segment delivered internal revenue growth of 3% in the quarter. Growth was led by card services and output solutions, including revenue synergy benefits, partially offset by lower growth in biller solutions and prepaid as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 at the end of the quarter. Transactional businesses performed well in the first 10 weeks of the quarter but saw a significant falloff at the finish. Debit transactions were up mid-single digits for the quarter, which includes the impact of double-digit declines in late March which also carried into early April. As you heard, we've seen improvements through April as some markets reopen and stimulus payments hit in the U.S. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, nearly doubling versus Q1 last year and up 14% sequentially. The number of clients using Zelle has increased nearly tenfold compared to a year ago and is up 44% from Q4 2019. We've also been seeing even stronger performance in Zelle and TransferNow over the last couple of weeks as we believe consumers are expanding their use of safe and secure digital money movement. Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 10% to $575 million in the quarter, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 41.2%. The increase was primarily from growth in high-quality revenue, synergy benefits and productivity gains. The fintech segment saw internal revenue growth of 1% as gains in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in periodic revenue. Revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient and less subject to variation due to the macroeconomics. We saw strong interest in demand for a broad array of digital solutions in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 9% in the quarter to more than 9.2 million. And Architect, our single digital platform, had year-over-year growth of 34% to four million users. We also saw a measurable increase in digital interactions, along with a greater use of underlying functionality. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter at $204 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 28.3%. The underlying results are stronger than they appear given a meaningful decline in license and termination fee revenue in the quarter. Core performance was driven primarily by higher recurring revenue, along with cost and operational efficiencies. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 10% to $94 million due to the benefits of cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate was up 80 basis points to 17.5% due to the combination of lower discrete tax items and reduced stock-based compensation benefits in the current year resulting from the First Data transaction. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23% for the full year. Free cash flow was up 3% to $760 million in the quarter, driven by strong operating results despite an approximate $100 million year-over-year headwind associated with merchant settlement timing. Free cash flow conversion was 111% in the quarter. We repurchased 8.6 million shares for $885 million in the quarter, which included redeploying just over $500 million of net proceeds from the majority sale of Investment Services. We bought more shares than anticipated under our 10b5-1 plan due to the volatility in the quarter and do not anticipate repurchasing shares at the first quarter's level for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, we had 674 million shares outstanding and over 13 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding, which is about 75% fixed rate, was $22 billion, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of March 31. We are on track to return to our historic level of leverage within 18 to 24 months post First Data merger through a combination of debt repayment and EBITDA growth. Additionally, we anticipate refinancing some of our current debt as we have an $850 million bond maturing this quarter. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are very strong, and we continue to expect we will generate significant free cash flow even in this economic downturn. We repaid $123 million of bank debt in the quarter and expect to repay more than $1 billion over the remainder of the year. While we are uncertain of the full impact of COVID-19 on our near-term business results, the combination of a resilient business model, a well-honed capital allocation strategy, $1.2 billion of anticipated cost synergies and a very experienced management team provides us with confidence that we will create sustained value for clients and shareholders through any economic cycle. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Bob. Given the crisis, we are pleased with our sales results for the quarter, down only about 1% to the prior year as travel limitations and pandemic actions took center stage. We are seeing very few deals being canceled but did see a bit more deal slippage than normal. We are pleased to see how quickly our sales and account teams have adopted virtual selling and how well market engagement has held up in this unique time. Our pipeline is solid with good visibility into Q2, including a number of recent COVID-related opportunities. We are also seeing our larger deals in the pipeline continue to progress as clients remain completely committed to their technology agendas. For example, on April 30, we expanded our relationship with OXXO, the largest and fastest-growing chain of convenience stores in the Americas, with presence in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. In Mexico, OXXO is, by far, the convenience store leader with more than 19,000 locations, and these stores also offer bill payment, money transfers and a financial inclusion product used by millions of people. Our significantly expanded relationship will begin with their Mexico-based fintech business providing account and card processing services through our first API and FirstVision solutions. We are very excited to partner with OXXO to help them even better serve their customers. As mentioned, we are withdrawing our 2020 outlook given the uncertainty in the environment. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2 revenue and earnings results compared to the prior year. However, given our strong business model and accelerated cost synergies, we see a solid path to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. This path generally incorporates two COVID-19 macroeconomic assumptions : first, that April and, therefore, Q2 are the transaction and volume low points, followed by a measured recovery through the balance of the year; and that we are not subject to a sweeping second wave of social distancing and shelter orders, which create further economic duress. While we don't have enough clarity to call this formal outlook, we expect far more visibility at our second quarter call, and we'll provide further directional clarity on our full year financial outlook. Your company is performing well in the midst of this once-in-a-century event. We are enhancing our already resilient business by accelerating integration, enhancing services for clients and developing strategies that will allow us to lead the industry regardless of the economic environment. We will also invest to ensure that we not only win now but emerge from this transformational time stronger and better positioned to deliver value for many, many years to come. Let me also say thank you to the 44,000 people of Fiserv, who have made us all so Fiserv proud, navigating this unprecedented time with a single focus, to serve clients with excellence and commitment each and every day. It's an honor for all of us to work with you. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Koning from Baird. David Koning : Hey Jeff, sad to see you go, but congrats to everybody. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Dave. Really appreciate it. David Koning : Are you thinking of running for President? I'd vote for you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Dave, right now, I just want to I want to do a great job on this quarterly call. David Koning : There we go. All right. Well, I guess my first question, just on the merchant segment. When we think about some you gave a lot of really good metrics, clearly doing well. It felt like you were saying maybe low double digits were kind of the trend in the last couple of weeks in revenue. Is that kind of what you're saying? Jeffery W. Yabuki: In transaction volume, we're seeing an improvement from kind of think about it in the 30s and has improved by about two-three. And we've continued to see improvement really that started toward the end of April but really since then has continued up to and including yesterday. And we're kind of seeing that gradual improvement happening. David Koning : Great. Okay. And then I guess just my follow-up. Maybe if you could talk a little more about in the merchant segment, revenue was flattish year-over-year, just on a pure reported basis. Obviously, you grew better than that, organic. But EBIT was down, I think, $60 million. You talked a little about periodic revenue. There's also probably a lot of benefits from synergies. So maybe you could just parse out why EBIT was down $60 million or so. Robert W. Hau: Yes. Dave, it's Bob. I think we try to give some color in the prepared remarks around that. From a synergy standpoint, recall that the Merchant Acceptance segment is largely is comprised of the original First Data merchant business. And so you're not seeing a lot of straight natural synergies, of overlap that you might first of all, in the corporate segment as well as in our Payments and Network business, where you see more of the synergies particularly in the early stages post merger. David Koning : Thank you, very much Operator : Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Hi, Glad to hear you doing OK, and congrats also, Frank and Jeff to both of you. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Darrin. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes, thanks. Darrin Peller : Listen, I wanted to just hone in for a minute on the merchant segment because it clearly outperformed what we've been seeing across the industry. And curious if you could just give us a little bit more color on the mix. When we think about the trends, 6% for the quarter, it clearly shows like the end of the quarter was better-for-you guys than others. And then you're talking about reaccelerating to some degree as well. Clover, I know you commented on. And then, I guess, the mix on discretionary versus non. Any further color you can give us would be great. Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would Darrin, let me take a shot at it, and then Frank and Bob will add as needed. I would say that one of the things that's most interesting in all of this crisis is there are macro factors that really matter. So where are you what geographies are you operating in and what is going on in those countries. And then probably at least as important, what are the industries in which you are serving and where may you have concentrations. And so if you are highly concentrated in industry verticals like travel, right, airlines, things like that, you're obviously going to see a different mix than if you are, say, serving retail, grocery, those kinds of things. And the same thing applies even in e-commerce, right? E-commerce, the idea, it still depends on where it is you are laid out. And I think one of the things that's important is because of where we sit geographically, even in some of the early stages of this that we were seeing around the world when it was starting in Asia and moving around, we our concentrations are such that we weren't getting beat up as bad early as we were seeing in some other places. I think the second thing is our vertical coverage in the most impacted areas is probably more favorable for us. And so we don't have those high concentrations. And then the third piece that I would throw in there is we've continued to grow in ISV, continue to grow in e-commerce in some of the digital areas. We talked about the wins that we had. And last year, we had 80-or-so wins. And that all creates an aggregate benefit. And then lastly, some of our larger merchants, if you look at our top merchants, they tend to be more resilient or maybe less impacted on a relative basis than others. And so all of that, I think, has added up to us having better results. By the same token, we obviously have SMB exposure in Clover that we were impacted in ways that were similar to others. I think based on some of what we were hearing, we might be seeing slightly better improvements over the last few weeks. And we're looking at it very closely every day to see how it's coming together. But it's all speculation, not knowing what's inside of other people's books. We're pretty certain about what's in our book. We like the way it's trending. And we are seeing absolutely when states or countries open up, you can literally see the lights come back on in places where they were not on before, and that's a benefit to our numbers. And again, we're tracking that very closely, sometimes it feels like every minute of every day. Darrin Peller : Yes. All right. That makes a lot of sense. When we and just my quick follow-up is really structural. I mean I think when we look at Clover, e-com, integrated or even on the fintech, on the core banking side, I mean, where do you think you come out of this pandemic where you gained market share because of your technology differentiation? And maybe just touch on the inbound demand for some of those fintech offerings versus what you would have seen before the pandemic. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. Thanks, Darrin. I would say that one of the things that we think is most differentiating about Fiserv versus some of the other companies is we are not just a merchant business, we are not just a fintech, and we are not just a payments. We happen to have leading market positions in each of those verticals as well as a very well-structured geographic presence that, prior to this crisis, was growing very significantly. And we believe and we're continuing to invest because we believe that's going to come back on that basis. But we were seeing toward the end of April, we were seeing a pickup in Zelle. We were seeing a pickup in TransferNow. We were seeing a pickup in RDC. So all of these things that are digitally oriented, we have found to be quite valuable. The other thing that's interesting, and this is not meant to cast aspersions on fintechs because we love the fact that innovators are continuing to create what's going on, but there's been very little discussion about fintech lately and much more discussion about scale, about certainty, about making sure we're there for the customers of our clients when it's needed most. I would say that other that idea, that idea of scale, if you take a microcosm like the merchant business, which is a very fragmented business with companies like us and others of our peers, all the way through independent service organizations, smaller providers, and in those cases, whether they are long-established ISOs or brand-new innovators, scale matters, the ability to make good decisions on onboarding, how do you manage risk in a time like this, that's all very important. And we think that the team that we've assembled, combined with the assets, is going to leave us in a place where we will be a share gainer, or we should be a share gainer, in this time, and we're certainly focused on making sure that happens. That's one of the reasons why we remain committed to $500 million of innovation, including spending money this year, which we think is very important when maybe others are putting the money back on the shelf. Darrin Peller : Got it thanks Operator : Next, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you, and Congratulations, Jeff, on a great 15-year run. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, David. David Togut : And congrats to you as well, Frank, on the big promotion. I'd just like to start there, if I could. Obviously, you've worked together for 18 months or so. Frank, what do you think you would do differently as you take leadership of the company from what Jeff has done historically? Frank J. Bisignano: Well, it sunk in that I'm the fourth CEO in a storied history. And I think if you look, we've been the world's most admired company most of 90% of this decade and before that, too. And what I've seen here and learned is a whole bunch of things. So I don't see us veering from any item that we were strategically driving. The innovation, we're very committed to that $500 million. Our capital allocation strategy, which is tried and true, is aspirational for most companies and was something that I saw when I came here and fully subscribed to it. Jeff and I have worked really, really closely together. I think we brought the team together very well. And I think really it's about continuing the client initiatives, being in the client's office and continue to innovate. Our innovation really is coming from our clients. So I don't there's look, this has been an honor and is a bittersweet moment to not be doing it with Jeff, to be honest with you. And so I don't sit here and say and never once said, said to each other, well, we're going to do that different. It's more about how we're just going to continue. And this team has really come together fabulously. So I think it's going to kind of really our best days are in front of us. So I don't there's no big changes happening here. David Togut : Just as a follow-up, could you put some guardrails around the growth trends you're seeing in Financial Technology, Payments and Network Q2 to date? I think these segments historically would be seen as being more defensive in a downturn. How should we think about the range of possible outcomes around revenue for these two segments going forward? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So David, I would say that the big difference in this economic dislocation versus anything that at least I've seen in my career is the manner in which the economic dislocation occurred, right? It wasn't a slant a slanted line, it was a cliff. And what we have never seen is an ability or an inability for people to use their cards or use their phones to pay for things. So we did see more impact in the debit and credit space than we would have expected. And had this been \"normal\", which is probably an unfair way to say it, normal recession, not that there's any such thing as that, I think we would have seen the normal hold up there that we had seen previously. And again, we're seeing that same recovery that we were talking about earlier happening in this area, but that's primarily because if you most of us here have been working at home largely for the last six or seven weeks. I don't fill my gas tank up very much when I don't drive it. And so it's just things like that, that people don't have the opportunities to use their debit cards and maybe their credit cards a little bit less. So you have that. In the financial segment, you or the Financial Technology segment, we're seeing exactly what we've always seen, David, and that is that's a transactionally oriented business. People are still using their they're still processing transactions, things still getting posted to the GL. I think interestingly, I think we just did a quick scan, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of PPP loans have been boarded in our core systems, and that those are new accounts. That will be part of the ecosystem. So all of those things will continue to create the stability, debit will come back. So we feel very comfortable that we still have a business of which the substantial majority of the business is highly resilient, think back to the '08, '09 days. David Togut : Understood. Congrats again. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Thanks for taking question just want to ask about cost controls. Any additional controls you guys are putting in place to manage the margins, especially in this second quarter where the impact will probably be the greatest? Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean we've talked a lot about what we're doing on synergies and acceleration of synergies. But we obviously have taken other measures inside the company. And I think you'll see them come through as we go forward. I mean we stopped the 401(k) match, as an example, which was a significant effort in the company. And you probably saw us still filing on the stock plan. But more importantly, it's I think during this horrible crisis, we've been able to have tremendous focus on every element of the company. So we're continuing to spend to innovate. I think we'll or we see more development hours, not less, going on, but them going on in a very, very measured way, delivering for the client in a different manner. So as you know, both Jeff and I have always had a good eye on the cost, and we'll continue that. The synergies are forever, and we're very, very committed to those. And we as you hear us talk about them, you could see how confidence continue to build. So I think you'll see us continue to do both very well. And stay, number one, focused on our clients and revenue. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And Bryan, I would say that we evaluated, should we take steps that would try to better align against Q2, because to your point, Q2 is going to be a rough quarter. But we believe that as the economy opens back up, we will see that kind of slower but a gradual improvement. And doing things that damage the business for a quarter, we don't think makes sense. I'm sure you don't think they make sense. But there is a lot of discretionary opportunity to, as Frank said, reallocate effort, make sure that we are only doing things that are needed right now and potentially redirect to places that we may have a better opportunity in the future. Again, on balance, we see a very solid actionable path to double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth this year. And so we're taking the steps to kind of center on that and being ready for the economic recovery. Robert W. Hau: And Bryan, the one thing I would add to kind of follow on and echo Frank's comment. One of the things we've talked about the last six months is should we end up in a recession, having now $1.2 billion of cost synergies ahead of us gives us an opportunity to pull levers harder. And you heard us talk about original expectation of $300 million of cost synergies, now grown to $500 million with an exit run rate of $700 million, that's permanent cost-out. That is not damaging the business. That is executing an integration plan a little bit faster than we had initially planned, given the opportunity that we have to do that, and reallocate resources. So we feel quite good about our ability to mitigate the downside during the COVID crisis but, more importantly, come up much stronger on the other side as we exit 2020 and exit 2021 and beyond. Bryan Keane : Got it. And just a follow-up to that is on the merchant segment. Just thinking about the cadence of improving margins. Is that as simple as just as volumes come back, we can get to more stable to potentially improving margins in the future? Jeffery W. Yabuki: The short, easy answer is yes. It's this business is a very intriguingly fixed cost business where you there are little, nano economics to costs to process that next transaction. But when you need to add a mainframe or you need to take down more bytes in a cloud or whatever, whatever technology metaphor that you want to use, you're buying that in bulk. And so from that perspective, we've got to make sure that I'm sorry, so from our perspective, as the revenue comes back on, it will flow through at a very high level. I think Bob talked about 270 basis points of impact in the quarter from that last very, very sharp off-the-cliff decline. And the other thing is the first quarter had the onetime kind of these onetime assessment items and other things that aren't we won't have to grow over. When we had given guidance, Bryan, we knew that, that was an issue. It's one of the reasons why we said, \"Hey, Q1 is going to be weaker.\" So we knew that was there. We knew it was coming. And so as things come back, we will absolutely see the benefit. I would just throw one other thing in there. We have had lots and lots of conversation around what can we do systemically to better manage, not in a short-term way, but what are the transformational things that we can do to get better leverage and flexibility in the cost structure, right? The beauty of this of not wasting a crisis is what can you learn. And we are seeing ways in which we think we can switch some of the cost structure from more fixed to variable, do different things so that when the revenue comes back, that, over time this is not a 2020 thing, but over time, we'll see an even bigger pickup in long-term margin accretion, which, as you know, is something that Fiserv has been famous for, for a long, long time. Bryan Keane : Thanks appreciate it Operator : Next, we have George Mihalos from Cowen & Company. George Mihalos : Thank you, and congrats to both of you, Jeff and Frank. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, George. Frank J. Bisignano: Thank you. George Mihalos : I guess, to start off, Bob, if we can go back to that commentary in merchant around the transaction volume now down, I think, sort of low double digits, so a big improvement there. Is the right way to think about that from a revenue impact that revenue will be down somewhat higher than that given that, I would think, there's more of a shift to sort of larger merchants versus SMBs? Is that the appropriate way to be thinking about it? Robert W. Hau: Yes. I would say nominally higher, relatively close. And of course, the other impact is relative Q1 to Q2. Q1, we saw that rapid decline in just the last two weeks where we're dealing with the improvement over a longer period of time. So we didn't bounce right back after just two weeks. Although we've seen some nice improvement, we're still down that low double digits in the quarter. Jeffery W. Yabuki: George, I think where you might see more impact is less on the differential between transaction and volume. And I think you'd see that maybe play out more at the margin line only because these very large merchants are going to be priced in a different way. But again, that's all accounted for when we think about how the recovery is structured and what the puts and takes are in that as we think about what do we need to do to achieve double-digit EPS growth. George Mihalos : Okay. That's very helpful and very impressive, frankly. One more question, if I may, just on the old issuer processing business within First Data. I'm just curious, are you guys seeing any sort of a push or early signs of any of your FI partners kind of pushing an account or card purge going on? Or are things just sort of steady as they go? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. George, we have seen purges going on in different places. As you would expect, I mean, banks and FIs are managing their cost structure just as tightly, if not more tightly, than we are. But again, I mean, bankers are usually pretty good at this. I think the increment is not substantial, at least not for what we've seen so far. And we expect that as we start to see a little bit more stability, that you're going to see less of that because the last thing you want to do right now is purge away for an FI to make money. George Mihalos : Thanks very helpful Operator : Next, we have Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, Hope you're doing well. Congratulations to both of you. I wanted to just come back to the commentary around the line of sight to the double-digit EPS growth this year. Maybe we can just talk a little bit about the algorithm, the rough algorithm to get us there. In other words, how much top line pressure can this absorb and still get to those levels? I guess it kind of comes back to those base case macro assumptions that you laid out near the end of the prepared remarks. And try and give us a sense of what sort of rough revenue growth range that would yield. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. It would be difficult to do that. I'm even though I'm appropriately social distanced from Bob, I think he would throw something at me or slap me if we gave that kind of detail in the algorithm. I think we'll be in a better place in July when we announced Q2 to provide that data. But I will give you some qualitative. So we have been looking at scenarios since very early April. And the scenarios have stayed fairly constant up until the last probably 10, 15 days probably 15 days, where you started to everyone was a little tentative as you started to see improvements, and you'd see up and down and up and down. But now we're seeing that trend come together. And one of the reasons why we pushed our call out, in fact, the primary reason why we pushed our call out, was we wanted to have April data by the time we got together. And I would say that April outperformed where we thought it was going to be even as recent as two weeks ago. And so from our perspective, we feel like we are taking a realistic trend to how the revenue will come in. But I would also caution us all to say we are living in unpredictable times. So we think we have a fair level of assumptions that are not incredibly aggressive, but they don't imply that we stay where we are right now for the remainder of the year, right? It's that kind of moderate, gradual improvement that gets us nowhere near where we were in the first 10 weeks of the year and nowhere near where we were last year in terms of growth rates, right? So we've taken that way down. We think it's fair and conservative. But the real reason why we're able to do this is, as Bob mentioned and Frank mentioned, we took our synergy targets up $300 million in March. And we had been working on that for quite a while, that was not new. And for us to, on a nontemporary basis, take our cost synergies up from more than $300 million to $500 million, with an exit rate of $700 million, while that took a lot of hard work at the team and it's going to continue to take hard work at the team, we did not recreate the wheel. All we did was accelerate our synergy plans, make sure we were doing the things that we need to do. And as Frank mentioned, we have another layer of things that we're looking at. We're not done. We snapped the line. We took a picture. But we will continue to do that. And as the world evolves, we'll do everything in our power to make sure that we are moderating our cost structure to the extent that revenues do things that maybe we don't think they should be doing, or we'd like them to be doing. So I apologize, Jason, for the longer answer. But that's at least the way we're thinking about it philosophically. And again, we wouldn't have made the statement if we didn't feel like we had a good, solid path and an actionable path to get there. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's a good, thoughtful answer. Just a quick follow-up on Clover. Wondering if you're seeing any significant uptick in terms of chargeback risk as you think about the prospects for churn at the very low end, any qualitative or quantitative observations there would be great. Frank J. Bisignano: No, we don't. I mean relative to Clover, we won't see chargeback risk. And I think you heard us talk about what we did in terms of using technical expertise to get that restaurant app out there pretty quick. I mean, we've also had tremendous growth right prior to what you saw at the end of March. But I think what you'll see in Clover is us continuing to invest in it. And you should expect us to have that continue to grow very nicely and the clients with a high satisfaction level. So a full commitment, we don't see look at small businesses struggling, and we're continuing to bring functionality that helped them through this difficult period. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And Jason, I think we would also add, from our perspective, and you heard this a little bit in the prepared remarks, we have people who have been through all kinds of cycles. And one of the things that was so incredibly heartening to me is not only do we have people who work for us today, but Frank, through his very powerful Rolodex I'm probably too old to use that word but through his powerful Rolodex, brought back people who have incredible G2 incredible experience, and we were able to very quickly get our arms around the exposures in the company. And we have been paying a lot of attention to what's going on, whether they be around industry verticals, refund levels, chargebacks, those kinds of things. And we feel like we are very appropriately reserved for where we are today, especially in Clover. In terms of the kind of exposures you have in areas like that are not nearly as meaningful as you would in merchant acquiring for industries that are on a deferred delivery basis. And most of what Clover does is a kind of right now or very near-end kind of service delivery. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, Operator : Next, we have Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Hey Frank, we're looking forward to your leadership. And Jeff, you'll be missed. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, Brett. Brett Huff : Two questions. One is, Jeff, you kind of alluded to this, and I kind of think about it as an arms race, the $500 million pot of gold that you have that only a select few of fintechs have. You mentioned some priorities in terms of investments, and I think we're all familiar with those. But has anything really changed? Or has anything really popped up where you said, you and Frank talking about this said, in this new environment, we're going to press our advantage in X and really throw some more time and effort and money after this vertical, this product, whatever, because that's the thing where we can move the needle most coming out of this? Is there a big change? Or is it just kind of more of the same? Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would say, at least right now, we have not seen new innovations this may be a little bit unfair, but new innovations yet that we would say, let's shift our focus from this basket to this basket. However, I would say that there are several things that we have been working on that we are quite excited about that we had planned to talk a little bit about at Investor Day, but areas that we think there's really significant opportunity. And we at some point, we'll be able to talk about it, but we don't necessarily think it would be prudent to do that right this second. But Brett, there are some really interesting opportunities out there, overall, probably in shades of the things that we've talked about before but could have a real impact on revenue, margin growth but, most importantly, client value. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then follow-up, and I'm not sure if this is answerable, but as you stand now, you talked about last 10 days outperforming in April versus what you thought just 10 days ago. So pretty remarkable changes between then and now. Knowing what we know now, and you have a lot of great data from Clover to big clients and etc., where do you guys fall on the V versus U versus W versus swoosh? Do you if you had to describe your base case, where would that fall in that kind of range of recovery? Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would say it probably not exactly sure what the economic variability is in a swoosh model. But if it stands for kind of a slow, gradual, moderate recovery over time, I would say we're more there than we would be any of the others. However, the difference is I think it likely is going to be more stair stepped. I think you're going to see jurisdictions open. You'll see kind of a small amount of lift-up. It will feel like a V, and then it will plateau, and then it'll feel like a V, and it will plateau. And it will feel more stair-oriented than any of the other examples. And I don't think any of us yet know this was a comment about a second wave. I just don't think we understand yet how might that impact us and how will this fall out. But we do believe that we will ultimately get back to a place where people are going to work, right? And if people are going to work, they'll probably eat something, they'll probably stop at the convenience store, they might even buy gasoline, and maybe one day, they'll take vacations. So we think over time, we're going to get back, but none of us know yet what that new normal is going to be. Brett Huff : Thanks for color Operator : Next, we have Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Thanks appreciate you squeezing me in here toward the end. Frank, you bring up you brought up Clover a few times, and I the world, at the point of sale, seems to be changing pretty quickly. Can you talk about some of the ways perhaps you're driving revenue beyond merchant discount, thinking about other sort of software solutions and stickier offerings that you may be able to bring to bear, given the advantage of owning the technology? Frank J. Bisignano: Well, I think one of the ways to think about it is specifically what we talked about. As we bring in software apps to do things like dine ahead, that's a perfect example, and you see such a great pickup in it, I think we've been very, very successful in adding apps and SaaS fees. So I think there's a great desire. We hone that skill over time, and we've built a lot more there. But what you also find is the power of our data and information and clients' ability to use it, very, very powerful. So I think that Clover was always designed to be much more of a platform than be a point-of-sale only. So we feel very good about it. We've invested more there, and we see the application take-up rate, very, very high. I think you're watching a change. And I think that change is pretty powerful. You see our virtual terminal expansion, very, very high. You're seeing our ability to move more businesses to be online and physical than ever before. And I think you'll see that conversion continue. And we've seen very, very good strength on it. Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would say the other thing we're doing is I mean, we one of the things that we are quite interested is, given the assets that we have and the partnerships that we have, we see real opportunities to create ecosystems that create more value for the Clover merchant. So expanding, kind of going beyond point-of-sale and starting to create the idea of a control panel for the SMB or the business owner to better run their overall business. So we see, as we have proprietary access to solutions that allow customers to move money, to transfer, pay bills, all kinds of things, we think there's an interesting ecosystem opportunity there, which, over time, we expect to grow. It's one of the reasons why we went direct to Clover to Clover users to help them apply for PPP, the PPP program and things like that. So just think about it as an ecosystem. We think there could be real value there both in retention as well as incremental revenue on a per terminal basis. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That's helpful. And if I may, as we see also what might be an accelerating transition to fintechs, especially around stimulus and PPP, do you have a sense of urgency feeling a sense of urgency from your bank customers to perhaps accelerate their investments in technology? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. It's a good question, Andrew. I think the answer is yes. We do see people, especially over the last few weeks, if you think back to it's hard to gauge time anymore. If you think back to mid-March or the third, call it, the third and a half week in March when things really started to hit, there was a lot of focus on the digital experiences, right, no matter what size institution, everyone was very focused on that. And we've seen that continue. We've seen more usage of mobile deposit, we've seen more usage of digital transfer, we see more usage of Zelle. So all of that, I think, stokes the desire for institutions to do more. At this stage, we are being a little bit more measured in believing that will turn that demand will necessarily turn into incremental revenue this year because if you look at interest rates, you can see that there's real pressure at the FIs, and so there's a balance. And so on one hand, we aren't seeing people abandon their technology agendas; on the other hand, I am hard-pressed to see people really decide to substantially increase their level of investment. So we're watching. We like the fact that projects are going. We're able to implement things virtually. We're actually learning a lot there. That could be quite an interesting way for us to change our expense structure but, more importantly, get technologies installed faster. So we'll just keep watching and monitoring what's going on. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you, for your time Operator : And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi, Jeff and Frank, congratulations to both of you. Maybe I can state both my questions upfront. The first one is, as we exit this sort of bottom here, that's for me, what does normalized growth look like in each segment? And then the other question I had was, as you look at the various synergies, and I kind of like the categorization that you've kind of given, are there things that kind of hit nearer term versus further out in terms of just the timing as you think of what hits this year versus, say, later on in that five year time frame? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So Ashwin, let me take the normalized growth question, and then Frank and Bob can add on to that, and then we'll have Frank and Bob take the synergy timing question. On the normalized growth, I think the probably the short answer to that is when will things be normal, and I think it's way premature to call what normal is going to be. I don't think we have any belief that normal this year is going to feel like the growth rates that we saw last year on balance. I think given what we've already seen in Q2, I think it's not at all likely that, that will happen. I think it's going to depend on things that are out of our control from a macro standpoint. Do we have good antibody testing? Do we have a vaccine? I mean until we see those kinds of protections in place that allow people to be more knowledgeable, I just think it's going to be hard to call normal. From our perspective, we expect we do expect to be able to, over time, see continue to win share and continue to execute better than or I'll just say, execute well. And I think that will turn into a good solid growth for us as a company. Frank, why don't you take the synergy timing question? Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. Thank you. I think, first of all, maybe we should start with the we Jeff and I saw the path to 900, very, very clearly and even more opportunity, and we probably made that clear as we were talking through it to you all over time. And as we peel the onion, and the teams came together, and I'd really say our ability to get stuff done from a team approach here has been very, very large, and I think the team saw the path to many more opportunities than Jeff and I actually saw with the initial group of players. And that was how we were also going to bring the best of both companies together. And people say that many times, but this is really where we're bringing that capability together. You heard it around the captive. And Jeff and I knew that one early. We didn't really know that it would go quite as well as it is. We also think about the tools we have to manage the company. You heard about the call centers. You even look at other tools. And they've allowed us to accelerate and to also allow us to be able to increase and recognize, as you could hear in our voice, that there's more opportunity as the team keeps digging in. So we feel very, very good about that. I think it's important to recognize the revenue side of it because as you see on the bank merchant, you have to look at that and see us as the partner of choice, one that gets generally picked in most situations and that people see Clover as a tremendous opportunity. But what we're seeing there is the teams, once again, are digging in, is bringing the cross-section of the company together to even get more opportunity. And I would think about us continuing to expand on that. So time is getting compressed because our leadership is able to do that, and our teams are very committed. The opportunities have gone larger. And we see a very, very good set of opportunities in front of us going forward. Robert W. Hau: Yes. I think the only thing I would add is we've seen, as you saw in our results and in our projections, move from $900 million to $1.2 billion over the five year period, quite quickly ratcheted up the revenue synergies back in early March when we announced both the improvements. And you see in the Q1 results, for example, corporate expense is down 10% year-over-year. We assumed all along that the duplicative corporate structure would be kind of the \"easiest\" to get at. And we've certainly seen that. We've seen nice improvement and acceleration in technology as well as in the operational efficiencies. If you look at our slides that we included in the release today, we've already executed, actioned $565 million of cost synergies. So almost half of the $1.2 billion is actioned, and that's really across all three buckets, getting that quickly. The leadership team grabbing hold of the opportunity and driving hard, particularly in light of the COVID crisis, to Jeff's earlier comment, not wasting the crisis, getting at the opportunity as quickly as we can. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Well, thank you, Ashwin, for the final question. Thank you, everyone. I know this call went a little bit long. There's obviously lots to talk about with the world and the place that it is in. Be safe and healthy. Thanks for your support, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Have a good evening.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Peter Poillon : Thank you and good afternoon. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki our Executive Chairman; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures, unless stated otherwise performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also, note that non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. Lastly, we're holding an Investor Day on December 8th in New York City to share our strategic vision, while we intend to host the event in person with appropriate protocols as circumstances allow, we'll also prepare to broadcast the content for those who prefer that approach. We look forward to seeing you at this important event. And now I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. A lot has changed at Fiserv's since we announced Q1 results. Coming off, tremendous financial performance in January and February, we hit the COVID-19 cliff in the second half of March which further worsened in April. At our May 7th call, we shared our thesis that April would be the likely trough and we expected to see gradual improvement from there and that is exactly what has happened. Each month revenue has improved sequentially from the lows of April and culminated with a return to internal revenue growth in July. Clearly, the results are not what any of us expected prior to the pandemic. However, we are quite pleased with our overall performance, the resilience and strength to produce nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, and tremendous sales momentum, which reinforces our market-leading value propositions and further positions us for accelerated growth. We successfully completed the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture on July 1st. As part of this, we welcomed nearly 120,000 direct clients to Fiserv and inked the new processing agreement with the bank as their provider for Merchant Services. We are grateful to Bank of America for their partnership and are excited about our future. On July 29th we marked the one-year anniversary of closing our historic merger. We've made tremendous integration progress while continuing to invest in our future. We've also gained significant confidence in the size and scope of the opportunity and wrapped up a series of first year accomplishments including generating $3.5 billion of free cash flow. We allocated more than $1.7 billion to share repurchase, well ahead of schedule and also repaid $1.1 billion of debt. We raised our cost synergy target by a third to $1.2 billion and increased our revenue synergy goal by 20% to $600 million, and of that in the first 12 months we have actioned $750 million of cost synergies and $160 million of revenue synergies. Interest expense has been reduced by nearly $290 million annually, which when combined with synergies actioned is more than $1.1 billion of run-rate pre-tax earnings in the first 12 months of what was originally set as a five-year journey. And sales, as measured in annual contract value, grew 15% over the prior year, supporting the power of our combined value proposition. Overall, these proof points are representative of our commitment to delivering on the promise of Fiserv in the client's office, harnessing the power of the best associate team in the industry and delivering sustained above-market returns for our shareholders. And last, we effectuated a seamless CEO transition to Frank on July 1st, seamless because Frank and I have been working closely together since the transaction was announced as we are today. And seamless because Frank continues to bring his leadership and commitment to deliver superior results against our proven Fiserv shareholder value creation strategies. As both an advocate and large shareholder, I assure you that the company is in fantastic hands with Frank at the helm. With that, let me turn the call over to our new CEO. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start by thanking Jeff for his tremendous partnership since we started talking about merging our two great companies almost two years ago and working closely together the last 18 months on the integration. I'm excited to lead this great company, which Jeff has led brilliantly for the last 15 years. While we, all of us, have been navigating the global pandemic, Fiserv has faced those challenges with a clear mandate of serving our clients with excellence, while keeping our associated safe and healthy. The great progress we've made on those fronts is manifesting in accelerated integration, improving results and much stronger than anticipated sales. Importantly revenue has shown sequential improvement each month since April bow. In June, we saw just 1% decline in internal revenue and we returned to internal revenue growth in the month of July. As Jeff mentioned, we have made great progress in the first year actioning over $1.1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings as new Fiserv and we are highly confident of the additional value ahead. In addition to our financial accomplishments, I'm thrilled with how our value proposition is coming together in the client's office. We closed a number of terrific deals in the second quarter, with sales up a very strong 38% over the prior year and 20% year-to-date. Our excellent momentum continued into July with two important competitive takeaways in our credit card processing business. We were selected to provide issuer processing solutions by Atlanticus Holdings and Genesis Financial Services, both leading providers of consumer credit solutions. And each on their own would rank among the top 25 largest card portfolios in the U.S. based on active accounts. Larger issuer's choose Fiserv for a variety of reasons, including our highly configurable processing platform, breadth of integrated digital solutions, and a client-centric approach. We expect both of these important clients to go live with our market-leading solutions next year. The resilience and diversity of our revenue was evident in our second quarter as we navigated a very difficult macro environment and generally delivered results above internal expectations across most key performance measures. Internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter and is down only 2% for the first half of the year. This performance is a strong testament to the great work by our people to deliver value for clients, regardless of the difficulty in the end market. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was down 4% to $0.93 driven primarily by COVID weakness. Adjusted EPS through June 30th is up 6% to $1.92 on excellent cost and revenue synergy performance and the strength and scale and breadth of our business. Importantly, we generated nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up 23% over the comparable quarter and up 13% to $1.7 billion through June 30th. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and for the year-to-date, have repurchased 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion. In dealing with these unchartered waters, we have put our energy and focus on sustainable actions, such as cost synergy acceleration, that we believe will make us stronger and more profitable for the long-term. We delivered $155 million of cost synergies in the second quarter results alone and now expect to book at least $550 million of cost synergy savings in 2020. We've actioned nearly $700 million, of our $1.2 billion target through the end of the second quarter and $750 million through the end of July. Revenue synergies are progressing equally well with continued strong performance in network innovation, bank merchant and cross-selling our market leading solutions across the company. For example, we were able to add our DNA account processing solution for a new clients digital bank, where we were initially awarded credit processing. Revenue synergies sales in annual contract value were more than $50 million in the second quarter. We saw continued strength in our bank merchant synergy program, even with the COVID slowed down, adding 42 new bank merchant clients in the quarter and nearly 70% were competitive takeaways. We signed more than 160 banks and credit unions in our first full year and have a very strong pipeline of nearly 400 institutions. Overall, we had actioned a $130 million in annualized revenue synergies through June and are in a great position to achieve $600 million revenue synergy grow. We signed 17 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 99 DNA including Northwest Federal Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Virginia with $3.4 billion in assets and United Federal Credit Union with $2.9 billion in assets. Another important highlight was South State Bank, an existing Fiserv Premier account processing client, which recently merged with CenterState Bank and selected Fiserv's core platform. And a number of additional solutions for their newly combined $38 billion institution. Even in these challenging times, our leading solutions continue to win in the market. Our industry-leading digital and electronic payment solutions such as Mobiliti, CardValet, Architect, TransferNow and Zelle have us incredibly well-positioned to support our clients in the digital transformation, which we believe is further accelerated by the pandemic. One excellent prove point on our digital momentum was in a recent competitive win with Northwest Bank, a long-term Fiserv's client who expanded our existing relationship to establish us as their strategic digital partner. Northwest added a number of new digital solutions led by Architect, our single digital platform, as well as a number of other customer-centric solutions, which will enable them to offer a more innovative and integrated solution for their clients. In our card-issuing business, we signed a important renewal with PNC, extending our long-term partnership with the seventh-largest bank in the U.S. for both credit and debit processing. Bank of Baroda, one of India's leading public sector banks awarded us their credit card processing in the quarter. When live, we will provide card processing services for four of the top six issuers in India. Prior to the onset of COVID, our merchant business had displayed it's emerging strength recording high single-digit internal revenue growth through all of 2019 and further accelerating to low-double digits in the first few months of this year. Even in the pandemic our merchant business has performed very well relative to the market and we believe is even better position going forward. That strength is attributable to a number of factors including the size and scale of our distribution network, geographic reach, diversity in diverse industry coverage, our Clover platform and rapidly growing and leading digital technologies, including e-commerce and ISV. Clover gross payment volume is recovering well from the weakness it experienced early in the quarter with GPV up 24% in June and was up 32% in July. GPV for the quarter was $23.4 billion or more than $90 billion annualized. Simply stated, our Clover strategy is to grow the number of clients using our platform asset is important. To extend the breadth of services offered to these clients. We're creating deeper client relationships through solutions such as virtual terminal and online ordering that were rolled out in Q2 and are seeing solid early adoption rates. We are pleased to see our digital merchant acquiring platforms riding the growing wave of digital transactions across a variety of industries and geographies. We are seeing accelerated sales momentum in e-commerce solutions, adding 50 new clients in the quarter, 86 year-to-date and a 144 over the last 12 months. As the pandemic spurs the need for innovation, we are seeing our investments in omnichannel merchant capabilities, such as order-ahead to pick up in-store gain even more traction. As a leader in this space, we provide omnichannel solutions to nine of the top 15 QSRs including McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell and Dunkin' Donuts. In Q2 alone these QSR transactions more than doubled to greater than $50 million per month. Given the demand we are expanding these capabilities into more verticals such as grocery as well as other geographic markets around the world. Our integrated payments continue to perform well, expanding our number of partners by more than 20% in the quarter. In spite of COVID, our ISV revenue was up double digits in the quarter. We remain focused on driving additional differentiation to capture additional market share in this space. Overall, we're very pleased with our first half performance in this challenging time. The combination of integration benefits the payoff from targeted investments and delivering new innovation that clients' needs, is translating to significant sales and market momentum, which we will expect will both support growth today and well instead of future. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you Frank and good afternoon everyone. We turned in a relatively strong performance in the face of a tumultuous impact COVID-19 had on business and consumer activity around the world, displaying the resilience and strength of our business. Total company internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter, driven by a significant impact of lower transactional volume associated with the global pandemic. Importantly, as Frank mentioned earlier, we saw internal revenue steadily improve as the quarter progressed with June internal revenue down just 1%. The monthly improvements continued into July with company internal revenue growth turning positive for the first time since February. Year to date, internal revenue has declined just 2% due to the strength of the business and better than anticipated progress on actual revenue synergies, which were $38 million in the quarter and are $65 million year-to-date. We now expect to be above the midpoint of our 2020 revenue synergy estimate of $75 million to $100 million. Although not in the category of formal guidance or outlook, based on what we can see today we estimate that our internal revenue is likely to be in the range of plus or minus flat for the year. Second quarter adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $927 million, which includes a 2 percentage point negative impact from dispositions and decreased 7% to $1.9 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin of 28.8% in the quarter declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year but improved 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin through June 30th declined 50 basis points to 28.3%. As anticipated, adjusted operating margin for both the quarter and the year were severely pressured by the COVID related decline in revenue and the associated expenses, timing of brand assessments and prior year dispositions, partially offset by $155 million of expense synergies achieved in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined 4% to $0.93, compared to $0.97 in the prior year, as adjusted for the investment services transactions that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through June 30th has increased 6% to $1.92, setting the stage to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 23% to $895 million and up 13% to $1.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was a stellar 142% and is 126% year-to-date. This performance was driven by strong working capital, timing of settlement activity in our merchant business and lower capital spending for the combined company. Our impressive free cash flow is the result of our resilient business, mission critical solutions and significant transaction synergies. We expect free cash flow for the second half of the year to remain strong, as cost synergies continue to ramp and we further capitalize on opportunities to drive efficiency across the company. Looking into the segments, internal revenue in the Merchant Acceptance segment, which has been the most impacted by the pandemic, declined 15% for the quarter and is down 5% through June 30th. As the world has begun to gradually reopen, we've seen improving transaction and volume metrics leading to improving revenue performance. In fact, we closed the quarter with acceptance internal revenue down just 2% in June, and in July returned to positive growth. As you've heard, we are seeing improving business trends in the segment. Clover GPV has improved steadily from April through July and Clover units shipped are back to positive territory ending June of 9% year-over-year. Total e-commerce transactions were up 26% in the quarter and omnichannel transactions gained even more steam. Some of the key deals in the quarter include sale of eCom solutions toward in store card processing for California DMV along with eCom solutions for six new regional grocers, including two more in the top-ten. Among the number of wins globally, we added both card present and card-not-present solutions for McDonald's in Germany and omnichannel solutions to Burger King in the U.K. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment decreased 47% to $223 million in the quarter on an adjusted revenue decline of just over $300 million, and adjusted operating margin declined 950 basis points to 19.1%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $506 million and operating margin was down 700 basis points to 20.2%. A combination of sharp COVID revenue decline and associated expenses, negatively impacted second quarter margin by nearly 800 basis points. The timing of network assessment fees in the quarter, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year was almost 300 basis point headwind. These two factors alone, which total roughly 1100 basis points of negative margin impact, more than offset the substantial and sustained positive impact of cost synergy actions in both the second quarter and year-to-date. You will also recall that Q2 is the anniversary of the BAMS deferred revenue item. So, we will no longer be a headwind in the second half of the year. We expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to improve significantly over the remainder of the year to a level above last year's pre-COVID results, with the majority of the gain coming in Q3. This improvement is expected to be driven by improving merchant volumes in revenue, cost synergy actions ramping over the remainder of the year and the reversal of the network assessment timing headwind. We now expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to be up sequentially at least 800 basis points to more than 28% for the second half of the year. As Jeff mentioned, the BAMS dissolution was successfully completed as of July 1st. We have realigned our cost structure as expected, which will reduce our expenses, run rate below the proportional level within the joint venture. Importantly, the dissolution moves a significant amount of scale and the resulting revenue to our small business, middle-market and enterprise client book. As a result, the size of our direct e-commerce and digitally oriented revenue has grown meaningfully and should lead to future growth and expansion, given the macro characteristics of these attractive markets. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% for the quarter as growth in high quality recurring processing revenue was offset by lower periodic revenue, such as license and termination fees, largely due to the pandemic. Year-to-date Internal revenue was in line with prior year, revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient due in large part to the mentioned critical nature of the solutions and as much less susceptible to variation due to macroeconomic impacts. In addition to the 17 new core comp processing wins in the quarter, we are seeing even more demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 6% in the quarter to more than 9.3 million, and Architect, our single digital platform, had growth of 56% to 3 million users. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 14% in the quarter to $252 million and is up 8% year-to-date to $456 million. Adjusted operating margin was up significantly in the quarter increasing 520 basis points to 35.4% and a combination of cost synergies and operational effectiveness, offset somewhat by lower periodic revenue. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points, as we deliver client-value across the scale business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue declined by 3% in the quarter. COVID impacts pressure a global credit issuer processing, prepaid and biller businesses and were partially offset by growth in card services and output solutions in part, benefiting from revenue synergies. Internal revenue through June 30th is comparable to the prior year. Revenue in this segment tends to be driven by transactions and/or accounts, and tends to be fairly resilient in a typical recessionary periods. But this pandemic has been different, for example, debit oriented transactions, which have historically been very resilient were impacted much more than prior recessionary periods and have solidly improved, consistent with the reopening, since the trough in early April. Debit transactions were down in low-single digits in the quarter, improving from down 20% percent early in April to being up mid-single digits in the second half of June and through July. Conversely, we are seeing strong growth in solutions such as the account-to-account transfers and P2P, which is up nearly double the prior year's quarter, and up 20% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has further accelerated, increasing more than five fold, compared to a year ago and is up 31% sequentially. We continue our bullishness on the role of electronic money movement and Zelle specifically, as the pandemic pressures legacy ways of moving money. Adjusted operating income for the segment improved 1% to $558 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.1 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin was up a very strong 220 basis points to 42% in the quarter and is up 250 basis points, to 41.6% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and strong cost synergy performance is driving current results with continuing runway for future expansion. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 5% to $106 million in Q2 and a 7% better to $200 million year-to-date, primarily due to cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter improved 20.5%, primarily due to the benefit of geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax items. Our adjusted effective tax rate is 19% through June 30th and we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%, in line with the prior year and modestly better than previously expected. We continue to allocate capital to build shareholder value, repurchasing 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion year-to-date. As you will recall, we began repurchasing shares much earlier than originally anticipated, given the strength of free cash flow even while meeting our debt commitments. As of June 30th we had 670 million shares outstanding and about 7.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We repaid $100 million of debt in the quarter and total debt outstanding, which is now 85% fixed rate amounted to $21.9 billion. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.9 times as of June 30th and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target by the second half of 2021. We expect to repay more than $1.5 billion in 2020 and therefore we'll allocate a large part -- percentage of our free cash flow to debt repayment for the balance of the year. Finally, let me call your attention to our Q2 earnings slides available in Investor Relations section of our website. Page 9 provides a summary of the financial integration milestones we have achieved in the first year as a combined company, some of which Jeff highlighted in his remarks. Even in the face of this global pandemic, we have taken actions that have locked in more than $1.1 billion of run rate pre-tax earnings, well ahead of our original objectives, and have much more opportunity ahead. While we are pleased with the integration performance to date, we remain committed to unlocking the potential we have in Fiserv to deliver even more differentiated value for our clients, as well as you, our shareholders. With that, let me call -- turn the call back to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. We believe one of the most important aspects of the transformational acquisition of First Data was the commitment to allocate an incremental $500 million to support innovation. This commitment is unique to Fiserv, and we expect this program to create differentiated value for clients, opportunity for our associates, and incremental growth for our shareholders. We will provide a detailed update on our priorities and progress at our December Investor Day. Based on our strong performance and sales momentum in the first half of the year, coupled with the trends we are seeing in our end markets, we are providing new 2020 financial outlook. For adjusted earnings per share to grow at least 10% over last year's level, adjusted for divestitures or at least $4.33 per share for the full year. Our 2020 outlook does not contemplate a sweeping second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances, which creates significant economic duress in the second half of the year. We are pleased with our financial performance in the midst of pandemic uncertainty. We returned to positive internal growth in July and expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. The combination of market momentum along with the $1.1 billion of actions we have already taken, give us increased confidence in delivering strong results in '21 and beyond. Diversity and inclusion have long been core principles of our award-winning people platform. At the same time, we are addressing the significant societal changes, which we believe will have a lasting impact on both life and business as we know it. Through listening and acting upon what we are learning, we are confident we will build a stronger and even more highly committed team. Back in June, we launched our back-to-business program, which supports minority and black-owned small businesses in the areas that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and social unrest. Working directly with local chambers of commerce, we have committed at least $10 million in grants, along with our best talent to help these businesses succeed and thrive. We are on the grounds in Brooklyn and Queens and we'll also expand to other markets such as Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and Oakland. We have already brought business coaching and payment solutions to hundreds of businesses and expect to help multiples more as that program expands. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage each day as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, let's open the line up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good to hear your voices Jeff, Frank and Bob. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hey David. David Togut : Encouraging to see the return to internal growth in the merchant acceptance business in July. Could you talk about the sustainability of that organic growth continuing, specifically for Merchant in the back half of the year and any thoughts you have on underlying drivers would be helpful? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. So, we feel very strong about that sustainable growth. What you hear us talk about, if you look at that business in total, we think the investments that we've made over time have really paid off. You hear us talk about the wins we have in e-com. So that's a tailwind for us. You look at the double-digit growth we talked about in our ISV business, you look at the GPV running through Clover, right now, that we've talked about and the growth of it. And then we have talked about the 162 bank merchant synergy sales which actually have no economics in our numbers yet, but you should expect that to continue, and that's a very, very integrated solution that promise that we would bring together core processing clients and bank merchant and help them grow that business for their institutions. And then I think if you think about the diversity of our client base, you hear us talk about what went on in those omnichannel transactions for the QSRs where we have a leading position, and then you also think about the geographic diversity that we have, which really we think is somewhat unparalleled. So our client diversity, our geographic diversity, and then our integrated solutions, we think we have the broadest and best solution set in the industry, and with all of that, we see very, very strong opportunity is -- the trough was deep but to be back to IRG and the type of GPV, we talked about, what Clover really, really gives us is high confidence about the future. Robert W. Hau: And Dave... David Togut : Great and just a quick follow-up if I could, reinstating the 2020 guidance is very encouraging. Could you talk through dimensioning of expectations for Q3 versus Q4? Robert W. Hau: Yeah, David, it's Bob. Just real quick back on your other question too, I would point out that the return to growth was beyond our merchant business, total company return to growth. So we feel quite good about the progressive improvement we saw throughout the quarter. And in fact, to your second question, that leads us to get our confidence to give the guidance of at least 10% EPS growth. In particular, we will see a nice improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in our merchant margin, the majority of that 800 basis point improvement, second half over first half is sequential improvement will come in third quarter. So we'll see a nice pickup from one of our largest segments in the business and as revenue comes back in those other two businesses, that's a nice scale of opportunities. So we're looking forward to really overall having a strong second half. David Togut : Got it. Just a quick final question on Virgin Atlantic, since that seems to be in the news quite a bit. Could you dimension your financial exposure to Virgin Atlantic as they go through their bankruptcy proceedings? Robert W. Hau: Yeah, I can't give you an overall number but I can tell you absolutely that we've been working closely with them, like all of our client partners in terms of supporting them as they restructure their business as one of their creditors and the filling -- the Chapter 15 filing, you saw yesterday was part of that overall process but bottom line is, we feel we're in good shape. I don't see any issue. We continue to process for them and I feel comfortable our position overall. David Togut : Understood, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys great job. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, David. David J. Koning: Yeah. I guess my first question a little bit like David's question to how sustainable are the growth in the other two segments. It seems like if the total company return to growth and Merchant did it, seems like the other two, probably did too in July. And maybe along with that, how big was the periodic impact in the financial tech business, I know that's the highly sustainable and highly recurring business, maybe just so we can understand if that grew in Q2 on a core basis. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. So I think when you look at the sales numbers we're talking about and how the company is coming together, it's beyond the expectations we had. We always viewed that we had this opportunity to come together and the client saw the same. And if you think about, we talked about, we've had more than 340 total synergy sales and then we also just have the general growth there. You hear about the Architect business up 56%. So in the totality of what we're dealing here, we actually believe that this company has very good growth in the second half relative to the trough that we saw. And so I think there you should feel that it's all, all elements of the company will be growing. You heard us talking about those credit wins and we had ones prior to that and the e-com wins, so across the board. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And David, in terms of your question about the periodic revenue, the Fintech segment would have grown, had we not had the headwind from periodic revenue, call it, really high-single digit headwind and some of that was absolutely driven by what we think is COVID impact, particularly in the license side of that. David J. Koning: Got you. No, that's helpful. And I guess my follow up with the BAMS JV being disassembled now. How -- are you going to start, including those revenues back in your revenue or you going to continue to exclude them the way, just kind of understand your accounting behind it going forward. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. So from a standpoint, first of all, they are in our numbers, they're not included in our growth rate or internal revenue growth rate. The adjustment that we started making as the dissolution took effect, we essentially will follow our standard practice for acquisitions and divestitures and excluded for one year forward and then pull it back in. David J. Koning: Got you. Great, well thanks and great job. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : All right, thanks guys. If we hit on the some of the digital areas that you're growing so well in Clover up 30% you mentioned, e-com I think you said over 20% or 26%. But when you combine that with omni and digital banking, can you talk to us about -- I mean if you could just hit on all the areas that you think are really performing well given the pandemic, maybe accelerated. And where you come out on the other side of this, what are the areas of your business that you're taking share and as a result. And then maybe just talk a little more about Clover firm, because the growth rate there 32% with I think in the $90 billion annualized GPV, was obviously a strong number. So, just I'm curious to hear what the strategy there is, and if you can sustain those kinds of growth rates? Frank J. Bisignano: Well, I think, first of all, if you look across the businesses and as we go across all of the, we have had a deep bent in digital. We've invested heavily in digital and that's why you see us when those type of deals like Atlantic is and Genesis, because of that you see Architect, really winning in the market in some ways. You see us being selected by many is their digital provider, right. And so, we believe the sustainability is high, relative to it. We think in some cases acceleration will occur given the amount of investment we've put into it. I think and we think about in global nature too we have a lot going on in Latin America, where you will see some classic innovative solutions where we take all of our capabilities and bring it to the client. I think if you look at the -- during this pandemic we have almost vested into it. So you don't see us doing anything other than adding resources in the areas like Clover and ISV and your watch that whole integrated solution come together, only adding resources in our credit processing group and not pulling back on anything. We use the synergy opportunity to save money and that acceleration's coming through well. But we consider COVID to have more growth opportunity, then you see right now, even at that set of numbers you heard. And we think our core banking platform has it as does our card processing. And then if you think about what we're going to do with the potential of this ecosystem, as we bring in Zelle and our other Mobiliti assets, our ability for the client's benefit is going to be very, very strong. And those are one of things Jeff and I talked about when we started and why we're playing the $500 million into innovation ultimately to be able to continue that sustained drive, Darrin. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's really helpful. I just wanted to actually ask one follow-up on the capital allocation strategy of the company. Just, during the pandemic, there is a lot of considerations, but you bought back some stock this quarter. Looking forward, obviously, especially with the transition from Jeff to you, Frank. Should we consider 2021-'22 still years where the legacy strategy for Pfizer, for who capital allocation and share buyback is similar still? Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I don't want -- I wanted to limit it '21 and '22 maybe, is what I would say is, one of the things I signed up here and one of the great things I loved about what how Jeff had brilliantly led the company, was the capital allocation strategy. And I think we owe it to our shareholders to continue to put them as our first priority in every dollar we spend. And so I would consider that and tried and true strategy just flow throughout. I mean, 100% and I don't think it's a '21 issue or '22 issue, that's tried and true forever. Darrin Peller : Great. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt O'Neill: Yeah, hi. Thank you guys for taking my call or my question. I asked a similar question about previously. So I think, it fair to ask you as well. I think there is an understanding that coming out of the pandemic, the secular acceleration on things like electronification of payments is well understood. However, part of the thesis that I think is equally compelling here is the newfound desire from your bank customers to potentially incrementally outsource to modernize their digital and mobile footprints and possibly reallocating investment dollars away from things like branches or ATMs or other items. So would you say that there is a newfound enthusiasm from your customer base for a lot of the incremental services that you're able to provide and any of the, the pipeline is maybe as robust as ever along those lines. Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, well I think the pandemic accelerated everything people talk about digital. Maybe what people thought, would take five years, it I will take two years or less than that, I mean you've watched us build capability in digital much faster than maybe we would have thought, it would have taken before and our clients are fully engaged it in. So I think speed matters and clients are completely committed to being digital-first and we're committed to deliver in digital-first for them. Matt O'Neill: Thanks, Frank. And just as a quick follow-up point of clarification I believe what I heard on the capital allocation front for the remainder of the year was a focus on debt pay down, which is certainly reasonable, but could you just confirm that, that's correct. And then presumably once the leverage gets down to the targeted range next year, the share repurchases would really kick in in earnest. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Matt, I would say we've demonstrated an ability to do both. We've done that over the years, we've done that since the merger when we first announced the transaction we suspended share repurchase pending the deal closing, we made commitments on our ability to de-lever, we're well down that path. At the same time, repurchased $1.4 billion in shares and we are paying down some debt to get to our targeted leverage mid next year. There'll be some debt pay down absolutely and I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We'll also see EBITDA growth, that helps create that deleveraging point. So you should absolute expect us to continue to allocate capital both in terms of investing in our business and then free cash flow is split between M&A activity when appropriate, but all through the eyes of a share repurchase and that debt delevering, we've got a really nice quite path to achieve what we set out to achieve by second half of next year and share repurchase has been part of the transaction, since and will continue to be going forward. Matt O'Neill: Very fair. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Ramsey El Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El Assal : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question today. I wanted to ask a little bit about the, about the BAMS JV dissolution and I guess first, can you sort of dimensionalize the magnitude and kind of cadence of the expense savings coming out of that, is that I didn't think I heard you mention that it was a contributor to large increase in margins and merchant next quarter and then also just in terms of the merchants you selected in that JV, are there any, is the tying with Bank of America and/or the pandemic creating any additional kind of like attrition or retention concerns around those merchants? Frank J. Bisignano: No, I'd go back to -- if you go back to last July, when we talked about how this will perform and where we are today, we feel great about our partnership with the bank, we feel great about, probably one of the dissolution, you've seen in industry with zero friction, then expanding, processing agreement for five years beyond our current processing for them and the bank has just been a great partner through it and we feel as good as we did ever. So I just, start with that and think ultimately both parties end up with a very, very strong good situation, but ultimately we do see cost take out and we do see growth opportunity as we talked about, maybe better than what we talked about last July. I will let Bob take you to a couple of more deeper details, it started at the highest level that this dissolution was hugely successful for both Institutions. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, I'd -- Just to add, Ramsey to your specific question. I did point out that as of July 1st with the dissolution completed we do see our overall expenses below the level of proportionate share that we had back when the JV was in place. And so we will see a lift in margins because of that in the second half of this year. Not all of that is yet behind us, but a big chunk of it is with the effectiveness of dissolution on July 1. Ramsey El Assal : Okay, and the second part of the question was just around any type of attrition characteristics around the merchants that you've basically pulled from the JV, whether there is anything that changes the -- any equation in terms of not having the Bank of American connection or maybe the pandemic or anything like that, are these merchants expected to perform on that metric, very similar to your other, the rest of your book effectively? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, No, we feel very good about it all. We feel very good about it all. Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would certainly expect them to experience similar characteristics for the rest of our client base. Ramsey El Assal : Okay, all right, perfect. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Ramsey. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey thanks, hope you can hear me cell service is really bad where I am at. Just a follow-up on Ramsey's question the BAMS merchants, anything to share in terms of type of merchant or the geographic mix of that. I'm just curious how that piece is different than maybe some of the other JV merchants, because I still think the market somewhat under appreciates the mix of what you have inside those JVs. Frank J. Bisignano: Well, I mean if you look at it there are some fabulous names, actually the fact of the matter is many of those names were contributed by the original company and we took those back and they're just fabulous household institutional names that we feel so good about as did the bank itself. And then the geographic dispersity would be exactly what, you remember this was a U.S. business, that was really fundamentally it was and at the SMB level, there is a large Clover base on both sides. So, remember these are large Clover consumers that generate very, very good returns and who we actually believe, we will do more with as we go forward, as we bring out even the functions you heard like virtual terminal and order-ahead and other capabilities. So I'd say great geographic dispersity, great reach from small to tall, some of the largest names you'll here and many of them were long-standing deep relationships with the predecessor company. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Hey Tingen I'd say overall we're quite pleased with how that overall selection process went. We're very happy with the 120,000 merchants, so we picked up and also remember we're still the processor for Bank of America's clients going forward. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yeah, caught that, with the five year extension, got it. And then just my quick follow up just, I know you'll share a lot more at Investor Day, I don't want to preview that too much, but just the $500 million, I'm curious, how much of that could we expect to allocate toward maybe modernizing some of the platforms I know there's a lot of discussion around modern versus traditional or older platforms and I'm just curious if that's going to be part of the roadmap of the $500 million? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I mean we haven't thought on the $500 million in that manner. We actually have been doing that over the past year in a very deep and aggressive manner and been usually successful at it. On that $500 million, we're really talking about next-generation opportunities whether it'd be in deed, whether it'd be in fraud, whether it be in decisioning, so you should expect us to modernize the place away from the $500 million, as annual run rate today. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Okay, that's good to know. Thanks. And Jeff, hope to see you there in person. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Me too, thanks. Frank J. Bisignano: Hey, man, he will. Tien- Tsin Huang : 100%/ Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Jeff, hi Frank and hi Bob good to hear from you, and good job in these circumstances, including free cash flow and sales. I was wondering if you could shed incremental color on sort of 3Q versus 4Q sort of by segment are there any specific, periodic or one-time impacts to watch out for, you, it's great that you are not expecting any periods of duress, like you mentioned, but are you incorporating periods of perhaps plateaued performance up and down, any incremental color would be great. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Ashwin I would say, of the top of my head there is no really big one-timer so to speak or items in the second half that would color Q3 versus Q4. I would expect to continue to see kind of the monthly progress that we've seen through the second quarter ended into July. So August gets a little bit better, September gets a little bit better, October, November, and hopefully, maybe by the end of the year, we get back to whatever normal used to be. I can't remember what that looked like it was so long ago, but we still have progress to go and at this point, we're kind of counting on, or expecting relatively steady progress through the balance of the year. So growth, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter. But as we see the volume come back in Q3 as I have mentioned, we expect margins to bounce pretty nicely in third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then a follow-up question is on bill payment where you guys obviously have sort of the leading franchise. Can you talk a little bit about the impact of the crisis on that segment given a lot of people find it difficult to pay bills and what not. What are you seeing in that segment, what's the volume dependency of any stimulus or anything like that, that one might expect there. Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I would treat it like it was a very small impact, not a large impact and stimulus has a little effect, but those clients and we have a fantastic franchise there and without financial institutions, also those clients are pretty -- have been very-very durable during this process. Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would say, Ashwin that one of the things we saw particularly stimulus coming in movement in Zelle. We saw some nice lift, with that, some real growth come through in sustained. So, it wasn't a one-time sort of a thing. And as you heard us talk, Zelle has been quite positive, both in terms of number of transactions, number of clients signing up, number of clients going live that continues to be a very nice driver for us in our Payment segment. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you. See you guys in December and maybe hopefully even in November. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks. Operator : Thanks. Thank you. Next we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, just wanted to get clarification on the margins in Acceptance. The magnitude of the drop, I think, was kind of surprising in below expectations or at least our expectations, but I am almost equally surprised at the bounce back in the margins being that quick, so I get the network assessments plus and minus there, but just thinking about volume and what that means for margins, does that explain a lot of it and how much your synergy is involved here on this bounce back in the margin as well? Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. So, Bryan, the network assessment fee, as I mentioned is 300 basis points, overall volume being down 15% in a business that's got some good-sized fixed costs really does impact quite substantially. And as those volumes come back, you'll see that lift return, the advantage on the network assessment fees is not only does the headwind side, but actually becomes a tailwind, and so you see a nice recovery there. And then the last item that, kind of, is a or is a change first half to second half is the BAMS deferred revenue, the headwinds ceases because with that lapsed Q2 of last year. So, you don't have the compare in Q3. In terms of synergies, we will continue to generate cost synergies that segment has seen nice progress like the entire company and that will continue into the second half of the year, but I would definitely point to the network assessment fees and timing and as well as just overall volume being a real part of it. Bryan Keane : Got it. And then just on the other segments, are synergies driving some of the massive improvement we're seeing and Fintech and Payments as well? Jeffery W. Yabuki: More so in the Payments, but yes, all three of our segments, plus the corporate expenses are seeing some real benefit where we are driving cost out of our technology, largely through our vendor discussions, you see the benefit across all three of the business segments. Our Payment segment is the area where the business is overlapped the most and so you get the more natural takeout other than the corporate functions in that segment. Fintech definitely seeing some benefit on the technology side. They've also been quite successful in what we used to call operational effectiveness or general productivity and taking cost out of that business. Bryan Keane : Okay, great. Congrats on the execution. Jeffery W. Yabuki: So the key, here, Bryan, I think is these are permanent cost out. This is cost synergy, this is not temporary actions in response to COVID that will naturally snap back, you haven't heard us announce furloughs or employee pay cuts. This is our effort to to drive synergy a little bit faster, then maybe we would have otherwise maybe not, but definitely our permanent cost out, that won't snap back, as you have to put those cost back into business. Bryan Keane : Got it. Helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the 38% increase in sales in the quarter, 20% year-to-date. Can you just talk a little bit about where you're seeing that uptick in demand through the pandemic and how sustainable and more secular is it versus some temporary things related to pandemic? Just a little bit more color there. Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, first of all, where they're 38% sustainable, you can be quite clear that the year-to-date number has large sustainability to it and when Jeff and I put the Company together, one of the phrases we use is, how we would come together in a client's office. And we're seeing it in multiple ways, and remember that 38% does include those competitive takeaways like Atlantic is or in Genesis, those are July numbers. And we talked about the $50 million of synergy wins in the quarter, it's across the board. It's a full demand of suite. I mean, we -- this digital nature that people would like from us is very strong and that's why we talk about Architect and how we're delivering that I think you'll continue to see us as bank merchant really has yet to turn into anything in our P&L yet, although, you would see that in '21. But I mean the sustainability and the durability of our sales efforts are very-very high. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then my follow-up, we just come-- circle back again to the Clover number, as I think that was pretty fantastic number up 32% in July, 24% in June. Can you -- that must mean that you've got a whole bunch of new merchants coming onto Clover in the middle of the pandemic, is that right? Is that the right interpretation of that? And kind of how and why and where and what -- for what segments or through what channels are they coming in? Like what's driving that? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, first of all, if you think about it, we always had growth, this has continued to grow. And now we have virtual terminal out there, we have order ahead out there. So, we believe when we're bringing eCom into Clover, when we're bringing virtual terminal, when we are bringing order ahead. Yes, we are selling more merchants also, but I want you to think also about how the acceptance levels of Clover are much higher than where we were at a different point in time. So it's more merchants, more functionality and more desires for the product by clients. I think that's how I think about it. Jeffery W. Yabuki: And Lisa, I just add one of the data point, we mentioned was unit shipments were up 9% in June, so we are getting more units out there that are helping that. Lisa Ellis : Yeah. Great, thank you. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Vasu Govil from KBW. Your line is open. Vasundhara Govil : Thank you very much for taking my question. I think Bob touched on in for just a second, but maybe if you could talk a little bit more about your appetite for M&A in the near term and what type of assets would be most interesting to you here. Frank J. Bisignano: So, first of all, we feel very-very good. After we put these two companies together and how it's all coming together, both in the client's office and in our ability to invest and build ourselves. You hear a lot about things that we've built in terms of capabilities, right? And look at everything, we're going to do is going to be again share repurchase because of our capability. So, will there be a moment where there may be something that makes sense? But we feel that our hand is completely following capability and we have a deep belief in our technology prowess and the ability to build things and scale them up and in a tremendous way, things like Clover and things like Architect, what we're doing with Zelle. So -- but if you want to go to backdrop, the backdrop is filled in when against share repurchase. Vasundhara Govil : Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Really good growth metrics on e-commerce in Clover and omnichannel type solutions. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color on how big these pieces of the business are today as a percentage of the total margin segment. Frank J. Bisignano: And first of all, eCom business has been thriving and winning and taking market share away, and when you look across the Company, we always thought that it was large, it was a fair amount. When you look at what we're doing in an omnichannel, that's new, but we're creating new total addressable market, was it? it wasn't like that was that all those order-ahead capabilities for QSRs existed before. But when you think about 50 million transactions, you are thinking about a tremendous growth engine that we're going to leverage across the world and across multiple verticals as order ahead has become a way of life for many. So I think when you think about it, these are pretty strong growth engines for us for a long time to create shareholder value for a long time, we've already built it and we've already demonstrated our prowess. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, i think bottom line is they are good and growing every day and might be a topic of conversation for you at Investor Day coming up in December. Lisa Ellis : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, guys, I appreciate the opportunity here. So I just want to come back to the comment around the internal revenue growth turning positive in July, I'm guessing that's maybe low single-digit up and so if that's the case, it sounds like you really don't need to see acceleration of those July levels to get to that rough target of flat for the full year. Am I thinking about that right? Jeffery W. Yabuki: So, Jason, I mentioned this earlier I think we, as we said, we are positive. Yes, it's relatively small positive and we expect that to continue to step up into August, September, October into the balance of the year and that's certainly what we've seen over the last three months now, back in the depths of April successfully every month, in fact, every week has pretty much been a nice steady improvement. We'll see whether that continues. The cost synergy actions and getting some revenue growth over our fixed costs absolutely helps with this phase.[Phonetic] Jason Kupferberg : Right, right. I guess, yeah. I guess the point I was trying to make is, almost it seems like you don't need to see the acceleration off July levels to still get to the neighborhood and flat and if you do see that you would probably be up a little bit for the year if I've got the math right there. Jeffery W. Yabuki: I would expect to see a bit of acceleration or continued increase in order to get to that flat plus or minus that I've talked about in my earlier comments. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, got it. And just one clarification to wrap up, I think, Frank, you had mentioned that the year-to-date bookings growth is sustainable. So just to put a finer point on that, does that mean it's something in the neighborhood of 20% is in your line of sight for the second half of the year? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah, Yeah, I mean you heard us talking about some good wins in July and I expect those to continue we all think its a very strong pipeline and very, very, very, receptive client demands. I mean our clients have commented to us at the highest level relative to how we're serving them during this pandemic. Jason Kupferberg : Well, great, I appreciate the comments. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Great. Frank J. Bisignano: Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. And you have a great evening. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Closing Remarks]",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin. Peter Poillon : Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki, our Executive Chairman; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that the 2019 non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information for periods prior to the acquisition date. Lastly, a reminder that we're holding an Investor Day on December 8. Given the current environment and to ensure the health and safety of attendees, we've made the difficult decision to host the event virtually. We look forward to sharing our strategic vision with you at this important event, and we'll share the details of our broadcast on the Investor Relations section of our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we delivered excellent results this quarter and once again are setting the standard for performance in these difficult and uncertain times. Our strong performance is a testament to the collective power of the more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to serving clients with passion and excellence. Your company has stepped up beautifully and is well down the path to achieving the promise of the transformational combination of Fiserv and First Data, which closed only 15 months ago. We have the strongest solutions, significant synergies, market momentum and a $500 million incremental commitment to innovation which have come together to propel market-leading results in these unprecedented times. The strength of our business has been front and center in the midst of a global economic turmoil. The model has proven far more resilient than many anticipated as we fully expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth and are positioned for far stronger performance for years to come. I've been privileged to lead this company for nearly 15 years, and I'm proud of what the team has done to create a platform for future success. I can tell you unequivocally that where we sit today is the best we have ever been positioned to deliver sustained growth and value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Frank and the entire leadership team are the right people at the right time to convert the opportunity ahead into our collective reality. We look forward to sharing much more with you on December 8. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, when I said thanks to Jeff, it's for the friendship and partnership. It's also for the 15 years of great leadership and strategic vision for Fiserv. It also represents a thank you from all the constituents, our associates, our clients and our shareholders. Today is Jeff's last earnings call, but his landmark leadership of this great company will last forever. Once again, thank you, Jeff. When Jeff and I met back in late 2018, one of the benefits we saw in the merger would be the potential power and resiliency of the combined business and the advantages we could expect in the event of a challenging economic environment. Neither one of us contemplated a global pandemic and the resulting economic implications we have faced in 2020. And yet, for the first nine months of the year, amid one of the worst economic downturns in the past century, we've grown our adjusted EPS by double digits, sustained internal revenue, expanded our adjusted operating margin and generated very significant free cash flow. For the quarter, internal revenue growth was 3%, led by our Merchant Acceptance segment of a very strong 6%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 310 basis points and more than 400 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 19% and is now up 11% through September 30. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $939 million in the quarter and totaled $2.6 billion year-to-date. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.6 billion of free cash flow. To put that in perspective, this is equal to the pro forma combined free cash flow, which included the full run rate value of synergies delivered nearly four years earlier than expected. Our ability to both increase and accelerate synergies, along with the overall strength of the business, has combined to deliver these outstanding results. After a terrific second quarter, sales were strong again in the third quarter, up 27%, with great results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and output solution businesses. Sales year-to-date were up 23%, and the pipeline remains strong going into Q4. Our sales teams have transitioned to the current reality of selling in a virtual environment, and the enhanced value proposition of the merger is resonating incredibly well where it matters the most : in the client's office. As you saw, we kicked off Q4 by signing a long-term agreement with Alliance Data, the fourth largest card issuer in the U.S. by accounts, to outsource processing for their co-branded and private label card programs. This important partnership further validates the differentiated value that we are delivering to the changing credit-issuing landscape across our broad suite of innovative technology solutions, digital leadership and commitment to client partnership. It is an absolute privilege to serve Alliance Data, and we look forward to working together for many years to come. As you've heard last quarter, we signed Genesis Financial and Atlanticus Holdings in July, both top 25 issuers. That, combined with Alliance Data, is a clear sign of the very strong momentum in our credit issuer business in the U.S. Globally, our leading VISION platform also continues to win around the world, signing Federal Bank in India, Bank of Queensland in Australia and Up Si Vale in Mexico. Integration continues to go very well. Although we will provide a full update at Investor Day, let me briefly update you on our synergy results, which are well ahead of original expectations. Through September 30, we've already actioned $875 million of our $1.2 billion cost synergy target. Importantly, we expect to enter 2021 with a run rate of more than $800 million of annual P&L savings. Comparatively, you will recall that we had originally targeted a total of $900 million over a 5-year period. We've also actioned more than $185 million in annualized revenue synergies through September and fully expect to achieve over our $600 million goal. Our network solutions have driven a meaningful percentage of our early success as we lay the groundwork for additional revenue growth over the next several years. The combination of ACCEL and STAR Networks makes us the clear number three debit network and, when connected to our other market leading solutions, should unlock new areas of growth and innovation for many years. Another of our top synergy opportunities is to deliver our world-class credit processing services to our core account processing clients. In the quarter, we were pleased that Golden One Credit Union, the seventh largest credit union in the U.S., went live with a cards payment bundle, including credit and debit processing, debit network and ATM-managed services, which provides its members a consistent and integrated cardholder experience. Our bank merchant synergy program also continues to make strong progress. In October, we signed out 200th financial institution since the merger. In the third quarter, we added 35 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to more than 130 new clients this year, with about 60% of those as competitive takeaways. We have increased the pipeline to more than 500 financial institutions for one of the most important opportunities for the combined company. We are privileged to have both a direct and partner distribution model for our merchant solutions, which allows us to cover the sales landscape across all business types and sizes. Next month, Verizon will begin marketing our new merchant solutions to its large portfolio of SMB customers, utilizing an exclusive Clover Flex terminal integrated with Verizon wireless technology. We also expanded our strategic partnership with Paychex, a leading provider of human capital management solutions, including payroll services, to more than 680,000 businesses in the U.S. to deliver merchant capabilities to their base of clients. This partnership is a perfect complement to Clover as both services are widely used by SMBs. We continue to see stellar results through our Clover platform with gross payment volume in the quarter of 30% to $33 billion. Momentum continued to be excellent in the digital-enabled segments of our merchant business, which includes e-commerce and ISV solutions. We added 42 new global e-com clients in the quarter and 128 year-to-date, a 41% increase over the prior year. Additionally, we signed more than 130 new ISVs so far this year and have seen a nearly 40% increase in new active merchants through our ISV channel. Global e-commerce transactions were up about 25% both in the quarter and year-to-date. Our e-commerce solutions have continued to grow with a significant focus on our direct business. We will provide you with important insights into the size, scale and reach of our digital-acquiring business at our Investor Day, which we believe will provide important context on both our direct and overall position in the current market structure. We renewed a number of key client relationships in the quarter with household names who value the breadth and depth of our solutions across both physical and digital presence, including Costco, Dunkin' and McDonald's. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and are seeing strong success with financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, de novo banks and fintechs. We signed 12 new core account processing clients in the quarter, bringing the total to 41 for the year, including 20 on DNA. We have signed six de novo banks this year, including signing First Women's Bank to our Premier platform in the quarter. We're particularly proud of this new relationship as First Women's Bank is a commercial bank with a primary strategic focus on lending to women-owned businesses. Lastly, even in these challenging times, we continue to invest for growth, including deploying some of the $500 million innovation commitment we made as part of our combination. We have already delivered solutions in areas such as advanced card fraud, digital disbursements and several unique innovations to support a touchless shopping experience across our digital merchant solutions. We look forward to sharing more on this important topic at our Investor Day. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We turned in a very strong performance in the quarter even as COVID-19 continued to pressure the global economy, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Total company internal revenue growth was a strong 3% in the quarter, with merchant acceptance leading the way at 6%. Year-to-date internal revenue was flat with the prior year pressured by multiple impacts of the COVID-19 on our business, partially offset by better-than-anticipated growth from revenue synergies, which were $49 million in the quarter and $114 million year-to-date. We now expect about $150 million growth from revenue synergies for the full year, up from nearly $100 million previously expected. During our last call, we shared the trends we were seeing at that time, including strong sequential improvement in transactions each month through the second quarter and into July from the April low. Since August, we've seen transaction growth rates generally stabilize at or around July levels. The current run rate of growth is aligned with our full year expectations for this challenging macroeconomic environment. Although we aren't providing formal internal revenue guidance, we continue to estimate internal revenue to be plus or minus flat for the full year, barring any incremental large-scale economic slowdown. Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a very strong 9% to $1.2 billion. Year-to-date adjusted operating income decreased by 2% to $3.1 billion impacted by divestitures and negative impact from COVID, partially offset by strong synergy performance. Adjusted operating margin increased 310 basis points to 32.9% in the quarter on the strength of $184 million of incremental cost synergies and excellent performance across each of our segments. Consistent with our comments last quarter, Q3 adjusted operating margin improved 410 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 29.9% through September 30 driven by the strength of our business and excellent synergy execution, which we dramatically accelerated to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Our cost actions are largely focused on synergy acceleration and not on actions that deliver short-term benefits, which would bounce back in subsequent years. We expect that our margin improvements are sustainable and should continue into the future. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 19% to $1.20 compared to $1.01 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services transaction that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through September 30 has increased 11% to $3.12. Given where we are to date, we fully expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the 35th consecutive year. As you heard, free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 12% to $939 million and up 13% to $2.6 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was 115% and is a strong 122% year-to-date. Looking into the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 6% for the quarter. Our results were bolstered by strong performance from our flexible Clover platform, our global suite of e-commerce and omni-channel solutions and our leading suite of ISV solutions. Clover gross payment volume grew 30% to $33 billion in the quarter and more than $130 billion annualized, and active merchant outlets increased nearly 10% sequentially. While the growth rate is not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels, it is impressive given the economic environment and considering that Clover tends to serve small- and medium-sized merchants, which are later in the recovery cycle. We continue to extend the breadth of services to Clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience like scan-to-order, which was launched recently to allow consumers to scan a QR code to order and pay directly from their table. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, is performing very well with adjusted revenue growth of nearly 50% in the quarter and is approaching pre-COVID growth rates. Our differentiated solutions for both ISVs and their merchants are driving excellent results, and we expect this business to be a strong grower for many years. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $425 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 180 basis points in the quarter to 29.2%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $931 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 370 basis points to 23.5% due to the revenue impact of COVID. On our second quarter earnings call, I shared our expectations that this segment margin would improve significantly in the second half of 2020 by more than 800 basis points sequentially, with the majority of that benefit expected to come in Q3. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up over 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by improved revenue, including the timing reversal of the network assessment fees compared to the first half of the year, which will not be as pronounced in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin improvement was also driven by continued progress in cost synergies and BAMS cost benefits. The Fintech segment saw internal revenue in line with the prior year's quarters as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was offset by much lower periodic revenue and specifically, termination fees, which created about 300 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, processing revenue was up 5% in the quarter, which demonstrated the scale and leverage in the business. Year-to-date internal revenue is also in line with prior year. We continue to see strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 15% in the quarter to more than 11 million users. Despite the pandemic, we implemented more clients on Architect than in any previous quarter, which should help bolster growth into 2021. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 19% in the quarter to $265 million and is up 11% year-to-date to $721 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 600 basis points in the quarter to 36.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 390 basis points to 33.4%. We continue to deliver client value across this highly scaled business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness, partially offset by the decline in periodic revenue. We're also pleased with the synergy benefits, which are positively impacting segment performance in areas such as technology infrastructure and procurement. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and up four percentage points sequentially. Growth in our card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was partially offset by COVID-driven weakness in our prepaid, credit processing and biller businesses globally. Internal revenue through September 30 is in line with prior year. The revenue improvements we saw throughout the second quarter continued in the third quarter. We were especially pleased to see a normalization in our debit business in the quarter as transaction growth was back to mid-single digits in the quarter and up significantly over the second quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as account transfers and P2P, which again were nearly doubled compared to the prior year's quarter and up 21% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle grew more than fourfold compared to a year ago, and we expect to see meaningful growth across our electronic money movement solutions as consumers move money in a more real-time world. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 8% to $608 million in the quarter and is up 6% to $1.7 billion through September 30. Adjusted operating margin was up 310 basis points to 43.5% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 42.3% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and cost synergy performance is driving our strong bottom line performance. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $117 million in the third quarter, with the year-over-year and sequential increase in the quarter driven primarily by timing of variable compensation and incremental COVID expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter increased as expected to about 23% compared to 22% in prior year period. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September 30 is 20.5%, and we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be generally in line with the prior year. As we shared last quarter, our capital allocation focus for the second half of the year is debt repayment after repurchasing 14 million shares for $1.4 billion in the first half of the year. We repaid $769 million of debt in the quarter, $1 billion year-to-date, and expect to pay down at least $1.5 billion for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.3 billion at September 30, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.7 times. We are well on track to achieve our leverage target in the second half of 2021 on the basis of both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment. We remain fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovation, high-value acquisitions and, most important, share repurchase remains our primary benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for our financial outlook for the rest of the year. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned, we saw a solid rebound off the trough of April into early August and seeing that consistent level of performance through last week. Looking at the business environment, our client conversations continue to be quite encouraging and generally centered on helping them grow their business, reducing their operating costs and better serving their customers right in the wheelhouse of what we do. As we had discussed on the last quarterly call, our back-to-business program to help minority and specifically Black-owned small businesses is in full force as we advance our nationwide objective : distributing at least $10 million in grants to qualifying businesses. We continue to see an increased interest in all things digital. Whether it's around e-commerce, more card use at point-of-sale, touchless payments, including digital wallets, or accelerating P2P payments, we are well positioned to provide the capability our merchants, financial institutions and business clients need. As you have heard, we are pleased with our results to date. Given the current economic backdrop and our strong financial performance, we are raising our 2020 financial outlook for adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year adjusted EPS growth of at least 11%, up from the prior guidance of at least 10%, over last year's adjusted level of $3.95 or at least $4.37 per share for the full year. As we've stated previously, our outlook does not contemplate the second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances which creates significant incremental economic duress in the last two months of the year. We put our strong financial performance for both the quarter and year-to-date as we navigate these unprecedented times. Our business is showing incredible strength and resilience, leading to what we fully expect will be our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, along with the foundation for even stronger results in 2021. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Koning : Hey, guys. Remarkable quarter. Great job. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave. Frank J. Bisignano: Thank you. Dave Koning : Yes, a nice start, Frank. First of all, maybe as we kind of look at Q4, it seems like you hit easier comps, less periodic revenue headwinds I would imagine, across Payments and Fintech. And in Merchant, it seems like the months have gotten better in the card industry kind of in September, October. Is there any reason, kind of judging where we are today, where we wouldn't see acceleration in Q4 really across the segments? Robert W. Hau: Yes, Dave, a couple of things you pointed out there. One, as we indicated in our prepared remarks upfront, we saw very nice improvement off the bottoms, the low back in April through July and then saw some leveling off into August, September and even through October at this point. And our expectation right now is for that to continue. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a fair amount of potential variability in that. From a periodic revenue standpoint, we actually do anticipate continued headwind into fourth quarter, both from the standpoint of terminations and licensing revenue, a combination of periodic revenue. It will be more pronounced in the Fintech segment but also we're seeing some of that in the Payments segment. Dave Koning : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just one follow-up. When we think about margins in Acceptance, Q3 was really strong. Was there some catch-up, kind of that assessment fees kind of catch up that would make margins go down sequentially? And then into next year, is the baseline level kind of that 28%, 29% from which to grow? Or should we think about the full 2019 as the baseline from which to grow margins next year? Robert W. Hau: So the brand assessment fees, we expected to rebound meaningfully in the second half of the year after we come off that difficult second quarter. We saw that absolutely come through in third quarter. And we expected that to bounce more meaningfully in the third quarter, a bit more to come to us in the fourth quarter. So sequentially, you'll see less of a ramp that we did, that we got the benefit of in the third quarter. In terms of kind of ongoing margin, I'm not quite ready to give you a guidance for 2021, but I will tell you that in the Merchant segment and, quite frankly, across the company, we feel very good about the cost actions we've taken, being permanent improvement. And as we get revenue growth across a very scaled business, we think these margin improvements can hold into the future. Dave Koning : Great, thanks guys. Nice Job. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll take the question from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Yeah, thanks so much. Really solid results and really like the new sales growth discussion there. I'm curious if -- would you agree that card processing sales activity overall is up? And if so, I'm just -- could you share maybe why? I don't know if you're seeing more off-cycle deals or just clients looking to modernize their systems. And maybe just to add on to that, just the pricing for some of the newer deals like Alliance Data. Anything -- any call-outs on that? Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean we've had these three big wins. In a general year, having one of them, would probably be a big deal. I think we spend a lot of time building out our product set. And it's -- I mean ADS was as big a deal as you're going to find. You take by account size, the fourth largest processor issuer. So my view on all of this is we have a great technical stack. We have tremendous surrounds. We've demonstrated a world-class base system and then a bunch of digital around it, and it's very appealing to larger issuers right now. And I think ADS was a very competitive process. But those are very, very long-term, valuable relationships that we cherish. And I think to develop them as having long-term organic growth capabilities and the ability to, given what we have inside our house, have great, great ability to fit within the platforms we run. So competitive processes, we've been fortunate in the wins, really three top 25 issuers; one, the fourth largest issuer. And I think it has a lot to do with the investments we made in the business and our maniacal focus on the client. Tien- tsin Huang : All right. No, that's great. I know it's -- three deals is a lot. That's why I wanted to ask the question. So just my quick follow-up, just on Acceptance. You're back to tracking the Visa, Mastercard volume here, just like you said it would. So I don't know, Frank and team, how would you rank sort of the drivers that have sort of gotten you to this point? Is it net merchant additions? Is it better sales activity, net of attrition? Is it Clover? I know ISV is a big contributor. But I don't know if there's a way to just rank what's sort of gotten you back to this point where you're seeing sort of good performance benchmarking-wise. Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think one way to think about it is we grew 10% in 2019. We actually had an industry-leading position. We came into January and Feb, and we were low double digits. And then COVID hit and we hit to the trough. But when you look at the breadth of our clients, from the SMBs to the largest global enterprises, that diversity, both of client size and the vertical nature of our clients, we're not over-indexed to any one piece. And then we have a tremendous geographic diversity. So you put those, and then you put Clover growing at 30%, and we all recognize all SMBs aren't in business. And as Bob has said, probably more late cycle. So we feel very good, and the Clover platform is gaining tremendous investment in it. The e-com business, which is our own direct business that we're winning those deals in and that stack that we built, really is resonating. The global presence of it and the omni-channel presence, us having both physical and electronic capability like e-com given that omni-channel has really resonated in the client's office. And I think our distribution is unparalleled. If you think about even signing up 200 new bank merchants since the deal, the great vision Jeff had around this core processing integrating with bank merchant, is showing up in the client's office in a tremendous way. And then you got Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe, so we're a partner of choice. And we're not at the growth rate we were pre-COVID, but we're achieving the growth rate we are because of the massive scale distribution and multichannel capability and being a partner of choice. And so I think it showed up all three quarters of this year just relative to market conditions. I hope that answers it for you. Tien- tsin Huang : It does. Glad to hear. Appreciate it, Frank. And Jeff, all the best again. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tim Chiodo : Thank you for taking the question. My question is around the e-commerce business, and fully appreciate that you mentioned we'll dig into this a little bit more at the Investor Day. But the business did quite well in the recent Forrester Wave Report, placing really just behind Stripe and Adyen, which were listed as the leaders, and really alongside Worldpay, you guys were both named strong performers. They gave you high scores in global acquiring and payouts in disbursement and a little bit weaker in APIs and architecture and updates and release cadence. I was just hoping you could dig into that ranking a little bit more and talk about the strengths and the weaknesses and some of the things maybe to improve some of the areas that weren't as strong but with an overall really strong showing. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. Thank you. I mean, look, I guess the best way to think about it is the competitive wins we have. And we still are building technology. We'll be building it forever. We're iterating always on it. And we're using the power of our data and information and all the other assets we have inside the house. I think the best way for us to cover it all is at Investor Day where we'll walk you through the full stack, give you a full look at really where we sit in the market structure and understand really how strong the e-com product is that we have and why we're winning the business that we're winning. So I think that would do it the most justice. But we feel good, we go head-to-head every day and we win more than we lose by a lot. Tim Chiodo : All right. Great. Thank you. And the quick follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it, but the 300 basis point headwind to margins in the Acceptance segment last quarter from the timing of the assessment fees, when that was, I assume, reversed to a tailwind in Q3, did you put a number on what that boost was to margins in Q3? And I'm assuming, to your point, we should see a little bit less of that boost in Q4. Robert W. Hau: Yes. We didn't actually cite it in the opening remarks. I would say we probably picked up about 2/3 of that in the third quarter. Tim Chiodo : Okay. Really helpful. Okay, so roughly 200 basis points or so. All right thank you so much, I appreciate you taking the questions. Robert W. Hau: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. In the fourth quarter and in 2021, would you expect the gap between the mid-single-digit debit transaction growth and the 1% revenue growth in Payment and Network segment to start to close? Frank J. Bisignano: I wouldn't necessarily think about it that way. But if I think about -- remember, that has multiple businesses in it, right? So you also have businesses right this moment that are affected by foot traffic. You got the prepaids, like gift, you have our TeleCheck business, and you have elements of RPL that are affected, that are negatively affected, by COVID. If you look at sequentially, that business improved 400 basis points. And so I think we believe that our business is very strong. We love the network. We talked about all the characteristics of having a number 3 network. So I would think about it that, yes, we're going to grow more. And I think we're going to talk -- that's why when we get to Investor Day, we'll take you through '21 and medium-term outlook. And we feel very, very strong about the Payments segment and all the innovation we have going on in the Payments segment and why our clients on both the merchant and the issuer side are so motivated by it. David Togut : Got it. Looking at the 12 core wins in Q3 and that followed 17 core wins in Q2, for what percentage of those wins was payment capability a significant component of the decision for the client? Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think the clients are looking at the holistic nature now, the integrated nature. And we've moved to -- which was always there, but even driving it even further, how we deliver an integrated bundle and how that integrated bundle makes it easier for the client to service their clients and, in fact, how we serve our client better. So they really are completely integrated. It'd be very odd not to see that right now given the fact that no one else offers the modern core we have : Debit, credit, merchant solutions and the digital suite. Those digital products are huge in this offering. David Togut : Got it. Quick final question on Zelle. Just going forward, since Fiserv was an early innovator in the P2P space, do you see Zelle becoming more of an ecosystem over time as we've seen, let's say, with Venmo and CashApp? Frank J. Bisignano: 100%. I mean, look at, we have a very long tail of opportunity in Zelle and then how we bring Zelle into the ecosystem and giving the assets within this company, how we utilize them across the payment spectrum. And I think you'll hear some of these things at Investor Day and see how we put this together with our bank partners to deliver them best-in-class payment capability. David Togut : Thank you. All the best to you, Jeff. Frank J. Bisignano: Thank you -- oh, that's Jeff. I answered for him a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt O'Neill: Yes. Hi, thanks everybody for taking my questions. I was just curious, when we think about the extremely impressive pace of cost synergy realization to date since the close of the deal, understanding you've already increased the target once, we're quickly closing in on the original target that was sort of slated for five years after, you guys pointed out, less than, I think, even a year and a half into the deal, so how do we think about that going forward? Are there longer-term incremental cost saves to be realized in the business vis-a-vis data center consolidation, incremental technology, etc? Or would that quantifiable synergy target raise of 1.2 somewhat of an upper bound before getting back to a more normalized level of operating margin expansion following the complete integration of the businesses? And I understand I might be jumping the gun a bit on Investor Day, so I apologize in advance. Frank J. Bisignano: That's OK. That's good.Investor Day would be part of the answer. But look at, we have -- that's 1.2 billion, of which transactions of 875. And you heard us talk about the effect of our synergies on the P&L next year. I think what you can go back to is think about both these companies premerger were very good at operational effectiveness. And there will be a moment where we will continue to drive operational effectiveness and it will -- it's part of the DNA, whether it's using artificial intelligence, whether it's using RPA, we continue to bring AI in through many of our service elements. And both companies had dimensions of it, and we've had the benefit to bring both together. I mean the standard work of closing data centers and consolidating, which we've done more than 20 so far, that will wind down in synergy, but we will always drive an operational effectiveness program. And you could count on us talking about that as a regular way, all right? That will be through -- and we have a deep belief that we are able to improve service, improve quality while, in fact, being more efficient. And that -- I think it resonates our client's office. They feel it, and it's the way that we'll run the company going forward. Matt O'Neill: Thanks frank. That's very helpful. I'll turn back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey. Thanks, guys. So the top line result on Merchant was clearly stronger than expected. I guess just on the Fintech side, to be clear, when we back out, it's fair to back out 300 basis points from term fees, right? And so that would have been a 3% growth rate. You guys have all these wins coming on from new business in DNA and some other platforms. If you could just talk through the tech positioning in that segment since we get asked about that a fair amount, if you really see Fiserv of taking share from -- given all the digital banking initiatives. And with these wins and bookings, when should -- could we see that actually show further acceleration from the, I guess, normalized 3% run rate? Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean you've got the issue of the periodic revenue, so we don't have to go through that again. But I think what you see us is winning in the client's office. And I think a good way to think about it is we had a third-party consultant, FedFis, come out and basically say -- if you look at where we sit, we have 40% share, in the mid- to lower end of the market, right, which we are very, very good at and committed to. Now we've had bigger wins. We just boarded NYCB, which is a huge client. But I think we view ourselves over the long haul as being a market-share gainer. And I think the company was a market-share gainer and is a market-share gainer in various segments. So I think -- and I want to go back to how we're winning. We're winning cause of the bundle. We're winning because of the integrated solution. We're winning because of the digital assets that come along with it. You heard Bob talking about the amount of Architect installs we did and the amount of Architect wins we're having, which all drive ultimately future revenue growth for us. So I think you're going to see a lot over the next few years. You'll see a lot on Investor Day of why these businesses are so strong in Fintech. Darrin Peller : All right. Thanks. And then just quickly on the Merchant side. Look, that obviously surprised folks, up 6%. And I know you touched on Clover, up 30%; and e-com, up 25%. Can you just touch on international? How did that do? And maybe if there's anything on integrated payments you can comment on. And really, Frank, the bigger question is, if you're seeing the top of the funnel filled with new businesses enough to offset the kinds of attrition that some might be seeing in this kind of market, I guess, in other words, if you're taking market share from the banks or anyone else despite some of the pandemic headwinds. Thanks, guys. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes, I mean, look at, international has a lot of countries in it, and every country is different. So I don't ever think about international. I always think about regions, and that's how we run it, and then down to countries. And different countries have different lockdown situations. But we're winning in the market outside the U.S., and we have strong growth in many cases and innovation both in the electronic space and in the physical space. And then if you look at Clover and you look at e-com, what you see is that they have had tremendous investments in their technology. We've had big changes in go-to-market strategy fundamentally in the client's office. We're running a very direct business now across the enterprise, and we are taking share. Darrin Peller : Alright, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks. Hi, Jeff, Frank, Bob, congratulations on the quarter. Good to hear from all of you. So is Peter, not to have him left out. Jeff, it's been a pleasure and hope to stay in touch. My first question is with regards to -- when we look at Fintech, what are your bank clients telling you about their ability to incrementally invest in their business? In other words, as they pivot faster toward digital offerings, what do you get from the digital offerings? Is that going to be incrementally enough to have you accelerate meaningfully versus the traditional stuff that you might have done, like the other stuff that you might have done? And there's two parts to it as well. There's a sales part of it, which you talked about, but also the ramps. We hear mixed feedback about the pace of signed contracts actually ramping, so if you could comment on that as well. Frank J. Bisignano: I can tell you what I hear once or twice a day from a bank CEO or somebody who runs the retail division of a financial institution. Digital transformation speed is one of the most important things we have going on. And so I think from a market structure standpoint, we feel that our digital assets in our core coming together in a client's office and transforming them and bringing all the other -- bringing the debit capability, bringing the credit capabilities, I mean one of the great synergies that Jeff and I knew we had was the capability of bringing credit to smaller institutions, and we're seeing it happen. We're converting them every week. So I think it's a digital transformation on all products. It's bigger than just the core and fintech, but it's how do they integrate together. And to me, I don't think this is about banks deciding how much they're going to spend. It's banks figuring out with us how much they could transform how they operate with their clients, which is way more valuable for them to grow and compete than it is the cost of what they need to pay to us. And that's how they see it. This is no longer a luxury, the digital transformation, it's a way of life. And so I think we are in a fabulous position. Our clients feel good about it. We have the resource availability. We showed a fabulous conversion and implementation machine. And I think all my interactions with people who run financial institutions, which happen every day, is they're highly motivated to get as much as digital opportunity. And that's what I think about when you think about long-term growth in Fintech. Robert W. Hau: Just quickly, to add to that, this is an area that we're absolutely investing in : in digital matters, payments, risk, capabilities to bring to those financial institutions in our fintech space, and we continue to bring additional products and services, and that's helping us win those cores as well as win digital users that you had us talk about. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And you talked about your revenue and the economic assumptions in the near term for 4Q. What about the cost assumptions? At what pace are you bringing cost back? And the cost that you took out incrementally just like many other companies, have you taken a shot yet at determining how many of those and what percent of those costs or what dollar value of those costs are sort of now in the permanent bucket versus temporary that will come back? Robert W. Hau: Yes, absolutely. And I made comments about this upfront. The cost -- the margin improvement that we're seeing this year, including the 300 basis point expansion that we had in the third quarter, is absolutely driven by permanent cost-out. It's one of the things that we actually talked about a year ago when we frequently got the question of how will you perform in an economic downturn, never anticipating that it would be driven by a pandemic and show up in 2020. What we said was, look, you know what, if we're headed for an economic downturn in the near term, we will have, at the time, $900 million, now $1.2 billion worth of cost synergies. And we've been working since the beginning of the year, particularly as the pandemic hit and we saw the economic downturn coming, to accelerate those cost synergies. And in fact, back in mid-March is when we announced the increase from $900 million to $1.2 billion. So the cost actions that we're taking are permanent cost actions. They are not in reaction to the COVID dynamic that you are seeing from a number of places. So we're not doing pay cuts or furloughs or things like that, that naturally come back into the business when the economy comes back. That's why we believe the margin improvement is sustainable, and we have future opportunity ahead of us as we continue to drive our cost synergies and then move to operational effectiveness into the future. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. So really nice results in Acceptance and definitely ahead of our expectations. Frank, I know this is something that might be for the Analyst Day, but can you maybe give us a very broad sense of sort of the run rates, organic run rates, by segment heading into next year for the three segments? Even ballpark numbers, just to help us model, would be great. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean, look, we are probably, I don't know -- it's good to talk to you, Dan. Thanks for being on the call. We're probably like, I don't know, how many days out, Bob, are we from Investors Day? Robert W. Hau: Probably about five, six weeks. Frank J. Bisignano: Five, six weeks, and we'll look at -- on Investor Day, we're going to take you through the inside and out, every business, the strength of our e-com business, right, how our segments operate, why our technology prowess is so strong, why we win in the client's office. We're going to talk to you about our long-established capital allocation strategy, with share repurchase as the primary benchmark for capital deployment. So I mean it's not -- I apologize because you know how well I think you guys, but this isn't the time to do segment guidance, if I may. But I'll answer another question if you got one. Dan Dolev : Yes, I actually had another question, really quick one. We did some work on the BofA attrition. Can you maybe give us a very quick update on how it's trending? I think last quarter, about the majority of the decline was due to COVID, and then about $10 million of that adjustment was due to BofA. How is that trending now in terms of that $20 million-or-so decline year-over-year in the BofA adjustment in terms of the split? Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think if you COVID-adjust, which is a little hard not to say these days, we find our attrition rates to be fundamentally at an outperform against the industry right now given the stack of technology that we're providing for clients. So we feel really, really strong about what we're doing in the client's office and the product set and the stickiness of our clients. Dan Dolev : Got it. Well, great quarter. Thanks guys, Appreciate it. Frank J. Bisignano: Good to talk to you, Dan. I'll see you soon. Thank you. And look, if I would like to take this moment to thank everyone for joining the call. I do look forward to us having a great virtual Investor Day with you, and Bob and I look tremendously forward. I would like one more time to -- I mean Jeff Yabuki has been a legend running this company, and I think you've all been fortunate to follow him, and I'm fortunate to follow him on his footsteps. So you guys have a fabulous, fabulous night. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Closing Remarks]",

And now I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people. We've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. Your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. Our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. We strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. We invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores among companies in the Fortune 500. We made outstanding progress on integration. We accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. We delivered 12% adjusted earnings-per-share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. We are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond. Let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and Bob will provide more detail later on the call. Total company internal revenue growth was 1%. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic. Total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion. Our sales momentum remains quite strong. Fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. Sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. We continue to extend the breadth of services to clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. For example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow Clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically. Carat. So our continued growth with global e-commerce transaction is up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. We saw our omni-channel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. We continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for Overstock.com and Wingstop in North America. In Europe, we signed Total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. We also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as Lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. Clover Connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner solutions business. In the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new ISV partners, bringing us to 176 new ISVs signed for the year. Those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in Q4. And strong revenue growth in the ISV channel. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with RFMS, the largest provider of software services for floor installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their flooring customers. We also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers. To further expand our value-added services for merchants, Fiserv and Citizens Financial Group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through Citizens Pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. The program expands a partnership we've had with Citizen since 2015 to provide new financing options. And we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space. Moving to account processing business. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on DNA. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. Service First, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions. Lakeside Bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed on for our core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes CheckFree, debit card services and Zelle. I'm also pleased that just recently, Republic Bank has partnered with Fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions. Republic is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 Bank in America for Service by Forbes in 2020. All of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. They selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. I'm also pleased to note that we signed three more de novo banks in the quarter. In our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. We gained a new agreement with Capital One to add Cap One's more than 1,500 ATMs to Fiserv's Money Pass ATM network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free ATMs across the country. And I'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate PayPal as a bill payment option for five share billers, a notable synergy sale. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. At Investor Day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinarily well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. Through December 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action a $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year. We entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. As of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. Giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding our $600 million target. Our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. In the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. The pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. We've taken two important steps in the last 60 days in this area. First, we acquired Ondot Systems, the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. We're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future. And second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a Chief Digital and Data Officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of Fiserv. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 3%. For the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. Growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic. During our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around July levels. In the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment volume growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution, which produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance. The fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points to the worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. And since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. Free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. For the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for SMBs. We feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- excuse me, in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. On our Q2 earnings call, after reporting our COVID impact at low point for our Acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. We're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently, termination fees, which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. For the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year. The shift toward digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter. Architect implementations continue at a strong pace. In fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth. Fiserv offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our FI clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service ATM deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. For the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. And as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue. The payments and network segment saw internal revenue decline 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by COVID-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment. Internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. Debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. We've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since June. And remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and P2P. Zelle transactions in the quarter more than doubled compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. The positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. This improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental COVID costs. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. For 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. However, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. As such, we expect our Q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than Q1 last year. As previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. We repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. We have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of December 31. In rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as Frank mentioned earlier, in December, we announced the acquisition of the Ondot Systems and closed that acquisition in January. Total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at December 31 and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.6 times. We are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and some further debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like Ondot. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late December, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy, the overall continuing strength in our global Merchant Business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is $0.05 above the range we provided at our Investor Day in December. The improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the U.S. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. And free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. Our internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021. The midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. There are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre-pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in Q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. Quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. We expect Q1 to be our toughest comparison and Q2, the most favorable comparison, then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. Throughout this past year, every Fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. Faced with these challenges, I'm proud of our results. Across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. Our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. We saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic. We meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of First Data to the verge of completion in 2021. And at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our Forward Together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. Our Forward Together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. A pillar of our Forward Together plan, the Back2Business program was launched last summer. As part of Back2Business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs. We are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. As a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as Head of Corporate Social responsibility to lead these efforts for Fiserv as well as oversee sustainability efforts for the organization. Fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. This is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hardworking and caring Fiserv associates around the world. I will close by thanking all of them, for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hey, good afternoon. Good stuff guys. First question for me is on Carat. You called out 46 new enterprise wins in Merchant Acceptance this quarter. Can you describe how the launch of Carat is improving your value proposition in the enterprise space, and maybe give some color on some of the customer feedback you're getting on that offering? Frank J. Bisignano: Well, I think the strategic point around Carat is that we've integrated for ease of access globally, so although it could be utilized in many currencies in many countries, its multinational capabilities is resonating very, very well in the client's office. And that ease of access, its ability to optimize acceptance is really what's driving a very high win rate there. And the engineering underneath it was bringing to a single platform, a single instance and ability to execute globally. And as you've heard us talk about through the course of the year, the hundreds of wins that we've had institutionally, and those are in active, big names that are leaning into the commerce and economy. So it's resonated very well in the client's office, a lot of work done by the team to build it out and get it to be the platform that's winning in the market. Lisa Ellis : Good stuff. My follow-up quick one is for Bob. Could you just give a little color on the segment level outlooks for 2021, and also what type of transaction growth or unit growth you're anticipating or is embedded in your outlook? Thank you. Robert W. Hau: Sure, Lisa. We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you directionally. Obviously, if you look at our Merchant Acceptance segment, it represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. We had given during Investor Day, an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. We certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that as we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and, in particular, in second quarter of 2020. Frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and EPS growth for that matter. And it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the Merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in Europe, but even across the United States, being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year. If you look at the Fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. We've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. As we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in Q1 and a bit into the second quarter. But by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the Fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6%, to be in that range for the full year 2021. And we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of a periodic revenue/termination fees. It's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. And so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021. And then the final segment, the Payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. Medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. I would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021, as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-COVID, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids and, of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. And as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement. And of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. The very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. But there are quite a few below those top three. It don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provide some nice growth into that business, into that segment. And the last driver of that business, I'd probably point to is Zelle. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of FIs on Zelle through Fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric P2P network and seeing more transaction volume. So that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%. And the last thing I'd point, Lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. Again, Frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. Q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially COVID-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. And we had, had a very strong first quarter until COVID hit really at the latter part of March and, obviously, very significantly in Q2. So I would expect Q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range. Such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and EPS guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half. Lisa Ellis : Fantastic color. Thank you very much. Robert W. Hau: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Koning : Hey, guys. Great year. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, David. Dave Koning : Yeah. Yeah, I guess first of all, I guess, sort of a similar question just on margin expansion by segment. I know you don't give a lot of color on this, but the Merchant segment was the one that was actually still down year-over-year for margins in 2020, where the other two nicely expanded. So should we expect as revenues come back in that segment for that one probably to be the most benefited by margin expansion than the other two closer to the guidance range? Robert W. Hau: Yeah, you're probably not too far off in that thinking. You hit the issue right on the head. Obviously, we had an extremely difficult second quarter. Both in terms of revenue and margin in that segment, really nice recovery sequentially in the second half of the year. And so we head into 2021 in much better position than we did in the first half, so we'll see some nice improvement. Again, you'll get the benefit of the comparison point in second quarter of 2021. Overall, I would say, when we closed the books, 12 months from now, we're on this call, I would expect margin expansion in all three segments and probably a bigger lift out of Merchant Acceptance business. Dave Koning : Got you. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, one thing you don't talk a lot about is the equity income line. It's about 5% of total profits. But I would imagine that got hit pretty hard this year, just the bank JVs and stuff and might correlate more with the Merchant segment, so it would probably be up more than just the average business. I don't know if that's a good way to think about it, but I just wonder if there's any context around the equity income line. Robert W. Hau: No, actually, I think that's exactly the way to think about it. And you're right, that's the largest portion of that is the Merchant joint ventures. And as we see the Merchant business overall recover, I'd expect to see the joint ventures participate in that and help with that equity line. Dave Koning : Awesome. Thanks guys. Robert W. Hau: Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. My question is really around a couple of, I guess, tech-enabled initiatives, generally in Merchant. I'm thinking about e-comm and the enterprise e-comm business and also omni generally, great KPIs in terms of volume. Bob, can you speak to yield contribution, and also maybe even Clover? I assume these are higher-yielding transactions. And given the growth rates should blend up acceptance organic revenue growth, all things considered, I'm just trying to think about order of magnitude and impact from your tech-enabled business generally. Robert W. Hau: Yes. Certainly, you're on the right track. Clover, with obviously heavy exposure in SMBs, generally has higher yield. And in general, tech-enabled does. Certainly, the thing to consider though is that was a big element of the growth in 2020. And so you don't necessarily see a massive acceleration of that because that was actually one of the things that helped the overall growth rate of the Merchant segment. As small businesses and retail broadly shut down again, particularly in the second quarter, people moved to tech-enabled e-commerce type transactions. And you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall Clover volume. We'll obviously see that continue. But as a percent of the overall share of activity within the Merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. So the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, Frank, you called out the bank channel, which is a part of your distribution network that I know you know very well, spent a lot of time on. Lots of new banks, do you feel like you can get adequate productivity out of that channel long term, especially as it relates to SMB merchant acquiring or acceptance? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, yes. It's 100%, yes. And I would think about, it in multiple ways. One, I would think about the bank channel itself. The other I think about, distribution partners also. You've seen us announce Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe. So these are contact points where, in fact, they're touching SMBs. And they think they'll enhance their relationship with the SMB, through a Clover offering. I mean, you see Verizon, packaging us in their offering now. So, I'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership. And then, we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. And because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brand feels very, very good and very strong. Will it have the same margin as our fabulous Carat offering? The answer would be no. But if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. In some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. It gives them a new offering into their base. Our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been two or three years ago. So completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. And it's actually a revenue generator for them also. So, from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. It deepens it. We're building integrated stacks that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also. Andrew Jeffrey : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : All right. Hey, guys. Thanks. I want to circle back to Clover for a minute, because we've done a lot of work on it recently. Again, it was up 25%, as you guys said. And combined with other KPIs, like the omni KPI, I think, 100%, it would seem that your market share position is up year-over-year. And so I'm curious if you can give us a sense of the -- like the growth, if there was growth in the number of mids -- or the number of the merchant count year-over-year, when you couple that in the SMB side together with the -- with both domestic and international and even the enterprise side sounded strong. So really just more than volume growth and revenue growth, I'd be curious to hear anything you can share about number of merchants and the experience in the SMB side versus enterprise. Frank J. Bisignano: Well, why don't I talk to you a little bit about the strategy behind it, and why that growth is happening? And it really is about market share gains. Its market share gains in the ISV space. Its market share gains in the e-comm space. And then, its market share gains on the SMB. And really, Clover has played a significant role in that. I mean, back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's one avenue for us. So what we've seen is growth in all of those. And if you think about, what's happened and the question one might ask is, how has your business performed as it has. It's because of the fabulous client base we have, in general. And then secondarily, us having invested heavily before we got here, actually in '17, '18 and through '19, we had a good strong industry-leading growth rate through '19. And then the combination of the two companies allowed us to be able to grow all facets of this. And I would say, when you look at it, it's growth across all of it; across SMB in every manner, shape and form; across ISVs as we didn't have a big position, and we continue to grow that out, and that will continue that pipeline is strong; and then bringing us into really Carat offering to our large institutional clients. So it is about market share gains. Darrin Peller : Okay. And then just my quick follow-up is on the capital allocation. I know we left your Investor Day looking forward to maybe $5 billion potential or even $5 billion to $6 billion of potential capital allocation potential per year. When we think about your appetite right now, Frank or Bob, when we think about coming out of this blackout period pre earnings, should we expect that you guys see the stock as undervalued like many of your investors do that you'd be proactive about it now going forward from here? And just to remind us, is that right, the right way to think about it where there's maybe as much as $4 billion to $6 billion or $5 billion to $6 billion of potential? Or maybe just between buybacks and deleveraging? Thanks. Robert W. Hau: Yes, Darrin. I think the $5 billion to $6 billion, I assume you're getting we -- during Investor Day, talked about $30 billion of capital available over the next five years. We certainly expect very good free cash flow into 2021. We had a great 2020 and see that continuing this year. And certainly, we continue to focus on capital deployment through the eyes or through the lens of share repurchase. We certainly would tell you that where the share price is today. We're a buyer. And I don't think you'll find many CFOs that tell you otherwise, but we're certainly trading below 52-week high. And given where we see 2021's results and where valuations have moved, we think there's a real opportunity. And so you'll see us continue to be active. We pretty much are in the market every quarter. I think we have been, for the five years, I've been here other than when we suspended for a couple of quarters post announcing the merger with First Data, and we'll continue to do that. We do have some debt to pay down with the balance of this year. But I'm a big believer of \"the genius of the end.\" And like we did in 2020, we'll pay down some debt, we'll buy back some shares, and we'll do some acquisitions. And we'll continue to do that aggressively across the company. Frank, you want to add anything? Frank J. Bisignano: No. I think as we laid out in Investor Day, and even if you look at what we've done over the past year and changed, you see a very balanced approach. We'll buy back shares or pay down debt, and we'll strategically acquire assets. Darrin Peller : Got it. Thank you guys. Robert W. Hau: Thanks, Darrin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Jeff Cantwell : Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Ondot acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about the fit there now that Ondot is part of the team? It sounds like it's a very nice business, have some good scale to it. It sounds like it's a modern platform. So it seems like it's going to be a nice addition. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? And then how can Ondot be enhanced, if that's the right word for it, by becoming part of Fiserv full time? In other words, what are the future synergies or the future opportunities you see there on a combined basis now that it's onboard? Any color there would be great. Thanks very much. Frank J. Bisignano: Yes. First of all, we know Ondot very well for a long time, had a great relationship. And the -- one of the founders actually came over to our company earlier. And so we -- and then we had always had a deep relationship with management. So I'd consider this a company we knew very well. And we could strategically think about how to integrate platforms. I think we always view it as the leading card-enablement platform for virtual access. But when you bring it inside to the company, our excitement and the founder's excitement are that we can do something much larger than they could have done on their own. And if you think about the Clover acquisition and what it turned into, there's great similarities. Of course, this is a much larger enterprise. We definitely increased our digital DNA inside the company. It will be a complement to our Sunnyvale -- large Sunnyvale presence with Clover and then with us sitting up a Chief Digital and Data Officer, the ability to ultimately take debit, credit, core banking and give our financial institutions the opportunity to have one click for their clients to get to all of that data is really where we're taking it. We've already inked a first win as a new company, a large name institution. So we feel great about it. I think we knew it well, so it was easy to integrate, and we are deep in integration meetings weekly and driving the top-line. And I think you could look forward to us having large growth and digital presence through its acquisition. Jeff Cantwell : Okay. I appreciate the color. I'm excited to see what you stating. Thanks very much. Frank J. Bisignano: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Looking at the $500 million innovation fund you announced at the time of acquiring First Data, could you address how much of that innovation spending you expect to occur this year? What's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion target of at least 250 basis points? And then are there any call-outs on specific new product innovations that we should watch out for in the next 12 months? Frank J. Bisignano: Well, thank you for that. And so we had talked about a year ago or so. We had created a number of working groups within the company to begin the generation of where these next ideas for innovation would come. And the output product of that actually was the ending up of creating a Chief Digital and Data Officer within the company. And that would have a structure to allow us to deploy the $500 million. Of course, we already have begun that, and begin to do it in a way that will accelerate growth as we go forward. Now if you go back to Investor Day, we had talked about the $500 million was in our outlook that we had given you. But there was nothing on the top line for it and we're already spending it. So I think what you can find today is a set of initiatives, a series of projects being deployed, a structure built inside the company with a Chief Digital and Data Officer to be able to help it move forward in a manner that is across the whole company. And so I would think as we get into the second half of this year and you move into next year, you'll start seeing these digital and data initiatives, which ultimately will roll into the P&L on the top. And so Ondot isn't viewed as part of the 500, but the capability it brings will allow us to move at a faster rate on many of the digital and data innovations. And what I'd say, connecting the white space between the four pillars of our business to allow us to unlock opportunity for our clients. Bob, anything you want to add? Robert W. Hau: Yeah, Dave, in terms of spending this year, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance and gets us still the 20% or 24% EPS growth and at least 250 basis point margin improvement. There will be some incremental spend this year, of course, recall this is a fair amount of development. And so a portion of this gets capitalized, drawn on the balance sheet and comes over time. And so it isn't necessarily a big increase year-over-year and, again, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance. David Togut : Thank you very much. Operator : And our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you so much. Just one question on new sales. I know up 19% I think, in the fourth quarter, 22% for the year. I'm curious, how you feel about the new sales outlook? Or what kind of targets you set internally for fiscal 2021? Do you feel good about compounding at that SMO level? Frank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I mean we had talked about during the course of last year and through Investor Day that we see ourselves being close to a 20% sales growth company in terms of institutional sales because that's what we're really talking about there. So -- and January is off to a really good start. So I feel really good about January. So that's where I got to start thinking about it. And the pipeline of opportunities is robust. So I mean, it is a very well-received integrated model in the client's office. And so -- and then with our client stats going up, I think that bodes very well. Our employee engagement going up inside the company, while we protected them in this very tough time, so I think we feel very good about what's going to happen during the course of this year around that. Tien- Tsin Huang : Excellent. Thank you. Frank J. Bisignano: Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We tremendously appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us, and have a great evening. Thank you for your time. Operator : [Operator Closing Remarks]",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call. For an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest to applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated performance, references are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. And now I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank J Bisignano : Thank you, Shub. Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. You may have noticed that Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along. I will provide some overview comments captured on the first three pages. And then Bob will provide more detail on a subsequent slides. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 100% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, which strong results in our payments and international businesses and this momentum continues into the second quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa Economica Federal to become the exclusive provider of Merchant Acquiring Services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift toward touch free transactions. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital enabled merchant business is performing through Clover, our leading SMB platform, Carat our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solutions set. We continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 2019 in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year, despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. Carat, our enterprise omni-channel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to prior year. Omni-channel transactions such as order ahead and pickup in store were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a US specialty retailer for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. We had a very strong result sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer offering coffee and convenience food solutions for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services and unattended POS hardware. In LatAm, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the Merchant Acquiring business where Australia's second largest bill payment provider. We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as state barn [Phonetic] where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of US Department of Agriculture SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continuing strength and expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV channel revenue growth, which was up 34%. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its lead in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with mortgage cadence, an accentured company, which provides more origination software to the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated cell continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with e-tail head [Phonetic] to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our [Indecipherable] relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes for a full service of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed two de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focus as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. Majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also like the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients from de novo banks to large financial institutions. In our payment and network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major US healthcare services provider strengthening our position in this industry vertical. Further building on our digital momentum in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as 10 fed credit union in both cases leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI [Phonetic] clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. And we expect to meet or or exceed our $600 million target over the five years post-merger. Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes, the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, six with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust through the rest of 2021. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discussed in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefining the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. An example of that commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondat Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Raduis8, a cloud-based platform that had hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. Now, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Bob Hau : Thank you Frank and good morning everyone. If you're following along at our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final two weeks of March last year. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and 103% percent conversion to adjusted net income impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable driven by a strong rebound in March. Turning to each of the segments, internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us including the UK, Germany, Ireland and Poland. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as a sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7% driven by the strength in the topline and continued cost synergies. The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. The shift toward digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broader way of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions Zelle and prepaid businesses including the benefit from revenue synergies was partially offset by headwinds in our bill-pay and credit businesses. Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account-to-account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. Our bill pay and credit businesses in particular given our retail private label mix saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2% flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former investment services business. In connection with this combination with Wealthtech Holdings. Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31 and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6 times. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank J Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previous. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date. The current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the US driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the US as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full-year outlook range and at once. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full-year outlook range driven by our business momentum and an easier year ago comparison. I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our community. During the quarter, we successfully completed our back to business grant program in the original six locations that were selected in 2020. We also held two additional programs in Milwaukee partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History month, March 2 event partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional brands to minority women owned small businesses. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open. David Koning : Yeah. Hey guys, great job. Frank J Bisignano : Thanks, David. Good morning. Bob Hau : Thank you. Good morning. David Koning : Yeah, thanks. So I guess first of all, just on the Acceptance segment really nice momentum there, maybe could you kind of walk through how January and February trends were? And then how kind of March and April trends were? Just to kind of understand how the months worked as things kind of progressed. Frank J Bisignano : Yeah, I'd take it at the macro level. January and February obviously began a little movement up in volume, but really not very much. If you remember, in February we talked to you all and gave a little look at what we saw up until then, and that's when we took really that bottom end up from through the flow up from 7 to 8 because we felt better than it did when we talk to you on December 8 at Investor Day. We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the US. I'd credit a fair amount of that to whether there is store [Phonetic] going on. We saw a stronger March, but I think on top of that we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I feel as we come into April and as we're going to head to the end of it we see the progression in the US. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up and Brazil continues to perform. And why we take the bottom up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful here. David Koning : Yeah. Thank you. I guess another way, kind of to think through this as we look really into Q2. I look back at the last five years of First Data, the GBS segment and very routinely, it was up about 10% sequentially in Q2, very close to the same every year and margins were up like the incremental margins were nearly 100%. So it's like a 300 basis points, 400 basis points, 500 basis points sequential jump in margins. Is there anything different about that seasonality? It would almost seem like the season now would be even better this Q2 than some of those past trends, but just trying to triangulate that. Frank J Bisignano : Yeah, I think you're thinking about it right. I mean look at it -- and January versus last January was definitely a back compare would consider Q2 and why we talked about it as being outside the top end of the range is because it's against the weak comp. So I would expect that seasonality to perform better than you would have ever seen. Bob Hau : Dave, recall during our earnings call last quarter 90 days ago, when we talked about the cadence of our revenue growth, we expected Q1 to be below the full- year guidance range, given the comps against pre-pandemic period really all of January, February and half of March, then second quarter would actually be above the full-year guidance range with the second half of the year more in line with that overall full year. We do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit Q1 to Q2 in the Merchant segment. We also see the benefit of pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the US as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in EMEA as some of the lockdowns began to be relaxed. David Koning : Yeah, great. Thanks guys. Nice job. Frank J Bisignano : Great to talk to you in the morning too, Dave. David Koning : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey guys, great job. Thanks. I want to just hone in on looking at the outperformance in the Merchant side going back. Frank, if you look at what you guys outperformed on, there's a lot of debate, was it mix or was it -- the technology. You showed some really good data points on Clover and Carat ISVs and now when thinking about coming on the other side of this pandemic. First of all, if you can comment on that point that it's probably a good combination of mix and technology. What was the areas that really stood out technologically? What are the areas that you now see on the other side of the pandemic that are doing more than you would have thought pre-pandemic and could drive even better growth to that 9% to 12% merchant range you've talked about? Frank J Bisignano : Yeah, I think Mercialys [Phonetic] think about Clover growth very, very strong, e-comm wins and that's the backlog that is on boarding continues to be very, very strong. Our ISV business performing well. I mean lockdowns in EMEA definitely affect us and I would see us coming, we could feel that in the UK opening up. Our client mix, we've been bullish on the whole way, but I've also been very clear that we have a huge diversed client base from SMEs to large enterprises across every industry sector as well as the large presence in geographies. And so I think when you look at outlook goal, we still have lagging verticals, restaurants, travel and services. So we have an expectation in the later second quarter and in the third quarter that recover well. We've invested heavily and Clover continue to do it heavily and Carat continue to do it heavily and Clover Connect. So I look forward to us being able to continue the type of momentum we have for a long time. Darrin Peller : Okay. All right. So all of those areas are really going to be a bigger percentage of the mix coming out of this than they were before I guess, right? Frank J Bisignano : Sorry again, Darrin. Darrin Peller : So whether it's Clover or Carat or ISVs the mix contribution -- the revenue contribution from those areas probably will be notably bigger percent of revenue coming out of the pandemic than they were before. I would say, and I don't know if you can give any update on data points around that, but the Investor Day started this off with some good ones. Is that fair? Bob Hau : Yeah, Darrin. I think there's a couple of things that will play. Number one is as Frank pointed out, while we have strength of diversity of geography and client base, meaning we serve the largest retailers in the world, all the way down to the smallest SMBs, the breadth has served us well. But we also of course have pretty meaningful exposure to restaurants and retail that have still a lot of recovery ahead of them that will help us with growth going forward. We think we've outperformed the market in the last four, six, eight quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue that. The other dynamic of course is as Clover and ISV and e-comm, which are growing faster than the overall average, become a larger part. You will see better growth from those becoming a more meaningful piece of the overall company. As we pointed out $1 billion e-comm business to grow nicely, it becomes a bigger part of that $6 billion segment and providing some nice growth. Darrin Peller : All right. Just very quickly, repurchasing shares. I think you did 5 -- a little over 5 million shares. Again that's a key area that we focus on for you guys, especially given good free cash conversion. So, just can you update us on your appetite and your capacity for the rest of this year. And thanks again, guys. Bob Hau : Yeah, sure. We feel great about the position that we're in, good cash generation in the first quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a little bit of accounts receivable growth driven this given the strong March, which of course will generate cash in the second quarter as we collect those receivables, 103% conversion in the first quarter, well on track to do the 108% for the full year. So we feel that we've got continued good strong free cash flow generation, gives us the capacity to buy back shares and of course, as you heard us lay out in our earnings, looks to me at our Investor Day back in December $30 billion of capital to deploy over the next five years. We did a meaningful buyback in the first quarter and we see the opportunity to do that for the balance of the year. Darrin Peller : Great. Thanks again, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Good morning, guys. I had a specific question on the use of the digital sales channels for Clover. If I recall prior to the merger with Fiserv, this was an area of First Data had invested really heavily in building online sales channel so a merchant could apply, get approved instantly by their Clover's directly and I realize we hadn't heard a lot about this too much in the last year or two. So I was just wondering at the time that was a major differentiator for your platform compared to your large competitors. Could you just update us on how widely this channel has been deployed and how significant of a factor it is in Clover sales? Thank you. Frank J Bisignano : I'd say, first of all, we continue to hear in there and when you hear us talk about the addition of new bank programs we view every one of those as us ultimately driving digital adoption, right? We always believe that partners were great places for digital adoption and we believe Clover itself was great place for digital adoption. When you look at the totality of our business globally, I would still put it in the not meaningful in total category, but a channel, which continues to accelerate its growth and one that we believe we will deliver more integrated opportunities for digital sign-up. And when you think about things we will do longer-term with our bank partners having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with Paychex and the Verizons also and using our direct channels to digitally sign up. So I think it will be part of the five-year journey we talk about. It's not the overwhelming part of our sign-up machine, but our capability is huge and our ability to attract new partners because of that digital capability and sign up merchants is being contributing to the growth rate. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then my follow-up, another one related to go to market or distribution on the Merchant side. Just a question on your strategy with e-commerce platforms and I'm thinking specifically about businesses that aggregate SMBs in a particular industry like restaurant aggregators or retail aggregators of a particular type. With everything you're doing with Clover, with Carat, with Clover Connect with the recent acquisitions, how are you serving these types of customers? Or how are you -- how do they sort of fit into your strategy in Merchant? Thank you. Frank J Bisignano : Well, I think it fits completely in our strategy. We've always viewed us as a partner of choice., a great distributor. We operate in basically every vertical and every capability and you hear us today, talk about extending our relationship in Brazil, in Latin America with one of the largest income players. That's really an example of us, our commitment to market places actually and you'll see that happen internally on the new open coming marketplaces us being an enabler and a distributor for them too. So I think we have a deep commitment there as you can capabilities are strong and you hear it and the things we will say today in our announcement. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Good stuff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, thank you. Amazing results, very impressive. Great job, Frank and team. Frank J Bisignano : Thank you, Dan. Dan Dolev : So I almost refused to accept the explanation that it's just a macro improvement. I mean I think there is significant share gains that you guys are getting out there and that's what we are hearing from the channel in Merchant Acquiring. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an understanding of who you're taking share from, who you're displacing? What are you seeing out there? How are you winning and who are you winning against? Thank you. Frank J Bisignano : Well, if you think about, -- it's a global -- it's a global business we're in. So you saw us announcing a large deal in Brazil. And we've been -- we started that Brazilian business back '14 and '15 and we've been taking share beyond where anybody had thought was capable on that market itself. So I'd point to that because we weren't a big ISV player back in '15 and '16 or probably '17 until we bought CardConnect and BluePay [Phonetic] but there we fit together with Clover and began that journey. You see that. You well know probably people thought we're an e-comm lagger [Phonetic] and we continue to win in that space. Now in summary statements. It's new markets but in many cases, taking it from all the places you won't suspect and you know I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we have talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly. And that in every market and in every vertical and it gets back to what we had said on Investor Day, when you look at this portfolio with Clover, with Clover Connect, with Carat, with global distribution with the client base that we have from largest in the world to the corner as I like to say it the corner store I think we've built a business that's the most diverse and probably has the most technology in all honesty. Dan Dolev : Thank you. And then, a quick follow-up. If I think about that 8% growth in Merchant, would you -- and I'm sorry if I missed it, can you give us maybe the cadence like January, February, March, and what it's looking like in April specifically on that 8% in Merchant? Is there any way to parse it out a little bit? Bob Hau : Yeah. Dan. I think there is a couple of things. If you look at the year-over-year growth rate obviously given the pre-pandemic comparison in January and February and then March half of the quarter was pre-pandemic. The other half -- half a month -- the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as particularly in the US, but also in Europe. People really significantly went home and commerce really took a hit in the second half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last two weeks. If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong, February as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather, particularly in the south in the US slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you -- if you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice, February again adjusted for weather was again in line or good with January and then we started seeing things really pick up in March, I'm sure not coincidentally and help supported by the SIM 3 payments that started flowing out. And we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the the recovery of the pandemic as vaccines really spread in the US. We're seeing more and more commerce retail picking up, restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely. Dan Dolev : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Pardon me. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. Lots of helpful inputs and commentary in the Acceptance business. Can you talk a little bit about churn. I'm just trying to get a sense of how that might improve or what the dynamic looks like as we reopen in terms of what's coming in the top of the funnel be that Clover SME enterprise e-comm versus what's coming out of the bottom the funnel and how we think about that sort of all translating into sustainable internal revenue growth in your Acceptance business? Frank J Bisignano : Yeah. Well a pandemic, I guess, a lot of people did shut down their businesses and get a lot of people to open up new businesses. I think we're going to see the strongest small business formation in the second half that we've ever seen. And that's why these channels we have are so darn valuable. Our commitment to the small businesses you probably saw us as a technical provider one of a few to the SBA for the restaurant brand. So I think we've done a good job over the long haul of keeping our clients and I think our Clover platform, our ISV platform, our Carat platform all are well received by our client base. And I look for strength in small business formation even for those who shut down to come back in a different shape and form. So I guess churn seems very good for us, if you want to think about attrition, I mean we feel strong about what job we're doing and of course any client leaving upsets us at any level. But I think the other part we got to put on top of it is tremendously strong small business formation and why all of these channels we have we believe are so darn valuable for us in that process. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And Bob, quick follow-up on payments. Again really nice KPIs, whether it's Zelle or debit transaction growth and I realize there are some pandemic headwinds perhaps in credit. Can you offer some insight as to win some of the digital solutions P2P I'm thinking in particular really start to move the needle from a topline perspective in that business. Bob Hau : Yeah. Andrew, there -- as you pointed out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. We continue to love the acquisition of Ondat and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There are some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today. We expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue. So we believe 2022, 2023 that Payments segment can grow 5% to 8% and we think this year will be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year and we see the full-year results. So I think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the Payments and we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing particularly the retail private label in the second half. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, good morning. Really appreciate the new slide formats real good. Just looking at the Acceptance side here, the 8% internal revenue growth and 13% global volume growth, do you see potential for that spread between revenue volume growth to narrow or even flip in the second quarter or the second half of the year? I'm asking because based on what Frank said around new businesses reforming and hopefully more in-store behavior that should help you I think on the spread. So I just wanted to check that. Bob Hau : Yeah, I think, that's the right way to think about it. There is certainly opportunity going forward and we'll see obviously how the economy rebounds into the second half of the year. All indications right now are quite strong. It's why we lifted the bottom end of our guidance range now twice in a row from 7% back in December to 8% in last quarter and now 9%. We see the economy improving and that helps overall Merchant Acceptance it helps the overall company but Merchant Acceptance in that spread also. Tien- tsin Huang : That's great. And then just a quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about Star and your PINless debit initiatives and investments in light of I think Visa did disclose that DOJ is looking in into some of the debit practices so those good time to check in with you on, on what's happening with the PINless debit. Frank J Bisignano : Yeah, I mean Star and Excel are standout performers for us and our investment and business continues to be large. I think you'll continue to see us invest where card on PINless debit and other aspects around signature too as we had talked about over time. That's a long haul. It's not a short haul. It's a lot of the infrastructure work, but we're investing heavily in the network and we have a deep belief in the growth in network and the power of the network, especially in this company, where we have a network business and we have merchants and it is good for financial institutions, Star and Excel together and good ground merchants, so a long journey. But that will continue to be something that we'll talk to you about it and we're committed to and show as part of the star-performing businesses in the company. No but intended. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. Thanks for the update. Bob Hau : Thanks, Tsein-tsin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the acceleration in Clover TPV growth from 25% in Q4 to 36% in Q1, can you drill down a little bit into the drivers there, for example, how much would have been from on-boarding new clients versus an improvement in same-store sales? Just trying to understand the sustainability of this higher growth rate for Clover. Bob Hau : Yeah, I think the way to think about it is, number one, we do think the growth rate of Clover is quite sustainable. We've seen very strong growth the last several years, 25%. 30%, 35%, 40% in a given quarter. I think you saw in fourth quarter really the second half of last year some slowing driven the pandemic obviously as we anniversary that and continue to see, as Frank pointed out, new business formation that certainly is a beneficiary to Clover given the depth of our channel capability and our distribution system, we think we can benefit very nicely from that new business formation. So I would expect that Clover revenue to me their GPV growth to continue for some time going forward, and we continue to invest in capability there and continue to enhance our solution set. David Togut : Understood. Just as a follow-up. Looking at the 2% organic revenue growth in the Fintech segment in Q1, can you call out the headwind that you saw from declining periodic revenue, so we can gauge the underlying internal growth going forward? Bob Hau : Yeah. For Q1, that periodic headwind, which again was largely driven by termination fees, was about 150 basis points. Said another way, outside of that, we would have grown about 350 bps. We do expect the headwind to continue into second quarter although to a slightly abated rate level and then as we enter the second half of the year that will no longer be a headwind for us going forward as it gets to a diminished level and then we'll see what happens beyond that in terms of, as the economy improves, do you see more bank mergers, which tends to be a driver of termination fees, but that headwind subsides a bit in Q2 and then I anticipated not being a headwind that we discussed in the second half of the year. David Togut : Understood. Thanks so much for the helpful detail. Bob Hau : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the broader M&A strategy. Should we expect more deals sort of similar size to Pineapple and Ondat? Or would you take a swing at something a little larger if -- or maybe more transformative if the opportunity presented itself? Frank J Bisignano : Well, I think, first, we feel great about our capabilities and the total hand we have, The tuck-ins have played very, very well for us for a very long time. I think if you'll look at Ondot and you're going to see that gets spread across the product base, to client base that digital capability and integrated fashion. I think Pineapple takes us on another area around our ISV capability. I think if you look at Radius8, it is about bringing that across this large platform, so they played very, very well for us. We've been very committed to our capital allocation strategy, tried and true and all of these acquisitions fit exactly within that envelope but of course, we pay attention, think about everything and as a dynamic world it keeps changing. So I think we're pretty committed to the path we're on, and we think about all things in the market always around the table. And so it has to work for our shareholders for it to make sense and that's why we held our capital allocation strategy. Ramsey El-Assal: All right. That makes lot of sense. Lastly for me, this is just a point of clarification, forgive me if you guys already covered off on it, but in the slide deck you mentioned pressure on long cycle credit processing in the Payments segment, what is that exactly? And as a headwind, do you expect to persist? Bob Hau : Yeah, I would -- that is essentially -- our credit issuer processing business is not transaction driven. And so as we see the economy improve in more active accounts, we'll see an improvement in that revenue. And so that's a bit of a lagging indicator and we expect that to to take place really in the second half, as the economy improves, we'll see more activity. In addition, you'll get different comparisons. And so we think that helps lift the growth of the the Payments segment and obviously the credit issuer processing. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. Got it. Okay. So that's just a euphemism for credit issuer processing effect, right? Okay. Terrific. Thanks so much. Frank J Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is open. George Mihalos : Hey guys, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask kicking things off on the Merchant side, the nice momentum you're seeing there. As it relates to EMEA, we're hearing anecdotally that things are getting better throughout the course of April, particularly in the UK, and I'm just curious if you could share any high-level trends that you might be seeing through the month of April and would you guys expect that region to be in the black in 2Q. Is there any reason why that's not possible? Frank J Bisignano : I think the UK is, we can feel it, we see it. I think referred to potentially somewhere along the line here too. I think Ireland still has challenges but you know, our expectation is that in the second half. EMEA is in recovery. I don't want to be thinking too hard about this quarter itself as much as the full year. And we believe the EMEA business will perform well in the second half. I think it's been under pressure in the first half. Bob Hau : Certainly feels like it's in the right trajectory though, as you say the restrictions are beginning to lift UK in particular and hopefully some of the other countries in that region soon. George Mihalos : Okay, that's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, Bob, on the on the Fintech segment, should we continue to believe. I mean it seems like it's tracking in the right direction, but is the 4% to 6% growth for Fintech. I think that you laid out last quarter, is that still on the table for '21 or how are you guys feeling about that range? Bob Hau : Yeah, we didn't give a guidance for '21, that 4% to 6% is our medium-term guidance. We don't give specific in your guidance on our [Indecipherable] segment level. I'd just reiterate we did -- we printed it too, if you adjust for the periodic revenue. It's a 3.5% in the quarter that subsides pretty meaningfully in the second quarter and is no longer a headwind in the third and fourth quarter. So we'll see a nice uptick in that segment and believe we'll be in that range in the second half of the year for sure. Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the results. Thank you very much. Frank J Bisignano : I'd like to thank everybody for their time today. I look forward to taking to you all. And we appreciate everything you do. Have a great day.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. And now I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank J Bisignano : Thank you, Shub. Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. On the macroeconomic side, we saw continued recovery in the US with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core but also on new services, business models and adjacencies. Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. Drilling down to the business segments, the quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro and restaurants. One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. Our lead in omni commerce is the reason we were honored with the omni channel provider of the Year Award from The Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat and Clover Connect are Fiserv's leading platforms for small and medium-sized merchants, enterprises, and ISVs respectively. Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical specific solutions in retail, restaurants and services. Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the Top 15 QSRs. Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands international expansion in the UK and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the Top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, ALDI, and the companies of Ahold Delhaize USA, expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. Evidence to Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the Top 10 retailers, we're expanding our merchant services by working with clients such as Adidas on innovative solutions, including our new consumer recommendation engine. This engine connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of Radius8, an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets, where we power cards funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we helped consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. We're signing up ISVs that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners derive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot and integrating with Clover. On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's CaixaBank in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing, once again demonstrating our speed to market. In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, SnapPay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. Moving to the Payments and Network segment, we posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of Zelle, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding Atlanticus in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these three banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all three clients in the third quarter of this year. We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage fintechs, digital banks and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with Prosper, a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. Our revenue with fintech issuance grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate toward institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated two recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all three business segments : in payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing in digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating SpendLabs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, STAR and Accel as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. Moving to the Financial Technologies segment, the quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is SunStream Business Services, a service entity which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. SunStream will be converted into DNA and a number of surround solutions. Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed LCA Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, Abiliti is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. We had our first client go live on the Abiliti platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated fintech app marketplace where our financial institutions clients can acquire, test and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we've already actioned over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing our $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network and card sales across our three major client segments FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution across the business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100% and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as SportTrade, ALDI, and Yapstone. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. The Financial Technology segment internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We completed two acquisitions in the quarter, SpendLabs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and Pineapple Payments, a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the Investment Services business and received pre-tax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction. Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3 times, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times by the end of this year. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank J Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've delivered. The quality of our assets, our relentless focus on innovation, our agility, speed of new client implementation with examples like CAXIA, ADS, Atlanticus and Genesis put us in a great spot to serve our clients. Our speed to market with the enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday along with the integration of business expense management into the Clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, add to our continued success. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa Race Massacre. None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. And finally before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Bucks for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Bucks are terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. They also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. Congratulations to the entire Milwaukee Bucks organization. With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Good to hear from you. I wanted to follow up on the two-year CAGR call out for the Merchant Acceptance segment. I believe you said it's running now at a 13% internal revenue growth on a two-year CAGR basis. One, wanted to just confirm that number. And then two, I wanted to kind of just drill into it a little bit, given that that's above your medium-term outlook for that segment, which as per Investor Day was 9% to 12%. Can you just highlight like what you're seeing, say, in North America versus ex-US? And are there any unusual dynamics in this quarter or do you see that sustainable going forward? And kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic when I believe it was running close to about 10%? Thank you. Frank J Bisignano : Well, I think it starts with the US has been the strong spot in the recovery right now. You heard us talk about unevenness outside the US. But I do think you saw a robust even last July when it all began coming back. I do think you've got to focus on the three legs in the US and internationally. The three legs are Clover, Carat and Clover Connect, right? And all of those were continued investments, continued build out and we're seeing it show up in the clients' office. So I would say, it's really driven by US. When you see that we say US and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same and you could kind of map to where recoveries happened or not. So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our teams galvanized very well around it. Robert Hau : And Lisa, just to hit the first part of that question, the 13% is an average growth rate. If you look at Q2 of last year, it was actually down 15% over the prior year. We're now up 41% over 2020. So the average 13% there. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : Maybe my first question, just on the Merchant segment momentum, I guess a little bit like what Lisa was asking about, I went back several years and the second half usually has quarters that look a lot like Q2. So usually Q3 and Q4 look a lot like Q2. But the question, I guess is, is the momentum building? You mentioned international still has room to improve. US momentum seems kind of off the charts, BAMS actually grew faster year-over-year than your core merchant business for the first time probably in many, many years. So are we in a momentum situation that Q3 and Q4 could actually be better than Q2 this year compared to when normally it's the same? Frank J Bisignano : I think the answer to that is yes. There is concern in the world. Right? So that's a little bit in how we think about it when we talk to about what we're doing. So there is a degree of us saying, the world's not out of the woods yet, although I think they've learned how to grow with this. So it's highly possible what you're saying could happen. We're driving the business to get the results we're getting. You see all the partnerships we're aligning to, to bring more. So, yeah, I'd say it's possible. But the world has spottiness right now too. David Koning : Yeah, that's great. And I guess, secondly, just as a follow-up, the past, I guess, handful of quarters at different times KKR has sold -- they're down to a much smaller position they were a year or two ago. But on the heels of now a really good quarter, what do you think their thoughts are about selling now? Frank J Bisignano : I'd start off with, first and foremost, I do not anticipate them conducting additional secondary offerings. Their holdings are just under 10% now. And they have told us they intend to sell shares on the open market over time in a routine and pragmatic way going forward. So I don't think we're going to see another secondary. David Koning : Sounds great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question. So over the last year or so, we've seen a few merchant acquirers become public. They have pretty fast growth in some more niche verticals. So online gambling, regulated financial services. Clearly, the First Data Fiserv merchant acquiring business is extremely well diversified and has a much, much larger scale, meaning that any one vertical can be overly meaningful, but maybe you could just touch on your approach to participation in those types of verticals, the extent to which you either are or will, how much it could help your business, what are the pros, cons, etc.? Thanks a lot. Frank J Bisignano : Well, I think we're in every vertical. When we talk about grocer, QSR, retail but we're in gaming, we're across the board. You don't have a business of this size and scale that isn't serving all markets. And when you look at our capability, we do a good job of bringing base capability, and then segmenting to what verticals specifically need. So I think we are completely deployed against -- and we're deployed against growth, I mean, we're deployed against growth. Where we invest is where we believe the growthier segments are. Robert Hau : Tim, I think one of the keys for our growth and, quite frankly, how we work through the pandemic and continue to grow the business meaningfully is we're very well diversified in terms of the way we go to market, whether that's our direct channel, through our bank partners, through our non-financial institution partners, joint ventures, etc., but also extremely well diversified across verticals and participate essentially in all of them, and have offerings that get us revenue growth across a very wide spectrum. Timothy Chiodo : All right. Excellent. Thank you so much. Really appreciate that. As a minor follow-up, was there any comment you could give on the assessments' timing on the contra revenue, any impact in Q2 given the difference in quarter-over-quarter growth, Q1 to Q2, some of those impacts that we saw last year? Robert Hau : Yeah. You recall, we had a pretty significant impact in Q2 of last year, a negative impact in Q2 that rebounded in the second half of last year. We're seeing the opposite now as we saw a big rebound in second quarter of this year. We do have a tailwind that will be muted a bit in the second half of the year. We don't have quite the same snapback in the second half as we did in the second half of last year. So, call it, roughly, of the 12 full points of margin improvement we saw this year over Q2 of last year, about 4 points of that was the brand assessment fees. And then that will be a bit of a headwind for us in the second half of the year. But we certainly see margin expansion continuing into the second half. Timothy Chiodo : Perfect. That's really helpful. Thank you so much both of you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Thanks a lot. And really appreciate your comments this morning. I know Bob talked a little bit about capital allocation. But I'm wondering if you can just help us think about how priorities or at least the way that you allocate may be changing, if at all, especially given kind of what's happening from the perspective of your stock is a little cheaper now, and so maybe that speaks to wanting to do buybacks. On the other hand, we're kind of continuing to see massive flows of capital into competitors, both through the private and public markets and the like. So just wondering if there's any evolution there on your thinking of how to prioritize use of capital going forward? Frank J Bisignano : I'd start with three[Phonetic] on leverage, that will be well behind us. And we did talk about Investor Day, $30 billion of free cash. And so I think you also see us continuing the strategy of taking Silicon Valley digital expertise and capability, integrate it into our company and fundamentally creating experiences that nobody in peer group can do. You saw it with Clover back in the day. And when I talked about Ondot, I did say that the acquisition of Ondot and then subsequently SpendLabs, but Ondot specifically, would bring a Clover-like effect to our company. And the fact that -- so you'll see us deploy capital to those type of acquisitions. But I want to bring clarity to what I mean in a Clover type. We've created a single instance for consumers to be able to get every banking product they have and have card functionality that surpasses the industry by a lot. So we have tremendous -- everything from digital issuance to the ability to put it in the wallet. I think you've got to really think about what we're doing there. And then we will invest in these products quite heavily. Right? So I think you'll see us continue to do those type of acquisitions that drive the digital presence, but we've done things unparalleled through those acquisitions. So we talked about $30 billion. You see the properties we bought. You see us integrating those properties, integrating for growth. And I think you'll see us unique, always though using buyback as a benchmark. Robert Hau : James, I think this quarter is perhaps a prototypical example, this digital enhancement, this digital innovation that Frank talked about in his prepared remarks and just referenced is a combination of investing in our business organically, internal investment, advancing our digital banking capability with Mobiliti, bringing more feature function capability to our mobile capability, adding to that inorganic investment the acquisitions of SpendLabs and Ondot in a quarter that we also repurchased 5 million shares. So the $30 billion of capital available we have this year and for the next four or five years allows us to buy back shares, making organic investment in M&A and develop internal products and internal innovation and generate very high return. James Faucette : That's great color. Thank you very much to both of you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys, good morning. Great results. So did I hear that correctly you said that this quarter was a record shipment quarter for Clover? Frank J Bisignano : That's correct. Dan Dolev : And so it sounds like it's more idiosyncratic share gains than anything market or reopening related. Maybe can you comment a little bit on who you're gaining share from, maybe specific verticals? And then maybe kind of the trajectory, you went from 36% in Q1 to 96% in Q2. How should we think about the remainder of the year? Thank you. Frank J Bisignano : Well, why don't I start off with a look at -- I think Clover is a platform of choice and Clover is a partner platform of choice. And we did talk about that Clover would get other distribution channels, and that distribution could be our own outside the US. It could be with our ISV partners. And then just in our base core business, our own, I mean, your question of share, when you're as big as we are, we're competing with everybody and we feel that Clover is at the top of the list of what people want as a product. So I think it is about the differentiated product and the capability that gets it the type of numbers you saw in this quarter. Robert Hau : And then, Dan, just to add, the 96% growth year-over-year, remember this is the quarter that's comparing to the second quarter of last year, which was obviously a very difficult year across the board. But I think the pertinent number here is a 38% CAGR over the last two years. So, obviously, Clover growing incredibly well, continue to expect that to be a lift and a share gainer for us as we lead with Clover in the marketplace. We're seeing benefits of continued innovation, continued investments in Clover as new business formation kicks in post-pandemic, as merchants that were not transacting at all or very much come back. Our investments in Clover Dining, etc. pay off when the economy recovers, people think of Clover and allow us to serve them with Clover devices, hitting our record shipment as well as giving us that nice lift in overall GPV. Dan Dolev : Yes, great. I agree, it's definitely everywhere, Great stuff. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Let me just shift to the fintech segment for a minute, which for several quarters was really in the 3% to 4% range and did show the acceleration to that 5%. You guys have talked about it being something that can do 4% to 6% growth. And we're seeing some signs of improvement now. You talked a lot about digital bank in your release also. And so I'm curious from a structural standpoint, given all the new competition out there, if you could touch on the assets you have and your capabilities and, in your view, confidence level around that segment actually being in that 4% to 6% or better versus low single-digit over time, that'd be great. Thanks. Frank J Bisignano : Well, you see a number of things going on our FinTech segment, but let me bring -- I want to bring complete clarity on the digital offering because I think it affects both core and our digital business. And ultimately, what we have a deep belief is that we're here to help our clients serve their clients. So the ability to take 2,100 Mobiliti banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the Ondot and bring that in a way that -- maybe the simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions to digital card issuance to digital card view to card free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your Zelle transactions. So we're going to take 2,100 Mobiliti clients, 1,300 CardValet and bring that to them. And then that will be what we -- and those are financial institutions, we believe that will also help our clients increase their digital adoption quotient with their clients. So we see this as a game changer. So it's early innings. We got banks up and running on it. And we will deploy. And then you hear us talking about, on top of all that for financial institutions, we bring in Abiliti that sits on top of all of it. But the most important thing to think about is our cores are strategic. The front end, though, is where we believe the tip of the spear and where we win to help our clients serve their clients. And you saw what we posted now, but I look forward to continuing to generate more revenue through better function we bring to clients that allow them to do more with their clients. And then, you've got an integration of a SpendLabs into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. And I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rated speeds for those size and scope. CAIXA is unparalleled. 70 days from signing, we're boarding merchants for them every day. And then you look at us taking SpendLabs and Ondot and I think we're going to have that same effect that Clover had when we look years out from now. Robert Hau : Going back to the -- sorry, go ahead. Darrin Peller : No, no, Bob, go ahead, please. Robert Hau : I was just going to bring you it back to the 5% growth. Obviously, we had a good quarter, hitting 5%. We indicated that periodic revenue headwind would abate. I think it was 150 basis points. Last quarter, we said we expected this quarter to be half that. We saw 80 basis points into the second half of the year. We see that no longer being a headwind. And through the first half of the year, we're now at 4%. So we reached the bottom end of that medium-term guidance and continue to be quite comfortable that we will be in that 4% to 6% range this year. And the things that Frank's talked about, the investments we're making in digital banking gives us an opportunity to continue to see that good mid-single digit growth going forward. Darrin Peller : Okay. Great. Hey, Frank, just quick follow-up on M&A. What are your thoughts on doing more tuck-ins that keep improving the tech stack and really thinking about maybe even just accretive to revenue growth, maybe even dilutive to EPS just type deals, just really add to the long-term growth strategy? Thanks, guys. Frank J Bisignano : Well, I feel -- obviously, you've watched over time the type of properties we buy. Our ISV strategy was born out of acquisition. Now it's a winning strategy. Clover was born out of acquisition. And I think you'd have to argue that's a bigger than winning strategy. You'll watch these assets, Ondot and SpendLabs, so I think you're just going to continue. I don't think it needs to be dilutive to EPS. I think we know how to make it accretive pretty darn quick. And what I just talked about was kind of the dream of the acquisition when we put the companies together, that we could take an asset like an Ondot and spread it all the way through because of what a great bank partner we were, and that we could bring it all the way from merchant to our fintech. So I think you should expect us to continue to do more like that. And I think we have a skill at it that we keep the talent, we grow the talent, and we build a bigger digital gene pool in the process. Darrin Peller : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Can you comment just on any July trends in the Acceptance segment? Any impacts from the Delta variant? And then also just on the revenue yield dynamics, I know those were positive in the second quarter in Acceptance, how should we think about that for Q3? Will volumes and revenues be a little bit more in sync? Robert Hau : Yes. So in terms of July trends in our Merchant segment, I'd say, obviously, through what 26 days or so, we have information yesterday, day before, slightly better than June. So continued improvement in growth. And I'm talking about versus 2019. When you do a 2020 compare, you get some real odd variations on the comparison points. So we're looking at versus prior year as well as versus 2019. But slight improvement in July versus what we saw in June, consistent with what we've got loaded in our full-year outlook with that growth rate and EPS growth. Call it mid-20%, 25%, 26% merchant growth, volume growth over 2019. In terms of yield, you saw a recovery, so to speak, in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1 as our SMB portfolio continues to grow nicely. I think that's going to be consistent in the second half of the year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. So, we should expect those positive yield dynamics to continue. I just wanted to switch over to the Payments segment for a minute. I know you're reiterating the higher end of the 5% to 8% target range. And I think you probably have to do 10%, 11% in the second half to get there. I know you've got some new portfolios ramping up, but just talk about the visibility on that acceleration relative to where you were in the first half. Frank J Bisignano : I think you see the credit momentum and you see us talking about that we'll have good second half revenue from that. You see, in general -- that's on the wins, and then, you see general credit momentum beginning in our portfolio. Debit networks, I've talked about the strength of them and we feel very, very strongly about what's going on there in debit transaction growth. So when you put all those in the calculation, you saw us go from 2% to 7%, and you should expect us to continue our trajectory north. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Good stuff. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about your payment mix in the Acceptance segment sort of in a post-pandemic environment. I know we're maybe not 100% there yet. But when you think about digital versus offline, debit versus credit, SMB versus enterprise, do you expect kind of a different mix in your business after the pandemic and how does that feed into your kind of longer-term growth algorithm? Robert Hau : Ramsey, I think we certainly have seen a broad movement to digital everything. That's why you hear his talk about the investments we're making in mobile capability and integrating our digital banking and card management experience. More and more digital transactions, e-commerce, etc. is certainly -- I believe the pandemic brought forward multiple periods of transition into that space. And I do think it was not transitory. Those changes are here to stay. And we'll see, as people return to whatever normal is going to be, what that continued transition growth rate happens, but, obviously, we're seeing great growth in Zelle. We're seeing more and more transactions on account to account transfers and good e-com volume, you heard us talk about in our merchant space, up 21%. So getting mobile first capability and digital experiences was a focus of ours over the last several quarters, and we're bringing a number of that into a single instance right now and continue to see that integration going forward. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. Let me squeeze one quick last one in here, which is, do you see the Feds revisiting the Durbin routing rule as kind of opening up a market opportunity for STAR and Accel? Frank J Bisignano : Yes. Ramsey El-Assal: Short and sweet. Robert Hau : Obviously, Ramsey, it remains to be seen the timing and when that will happen, but does look to be a real opportunity for us. Frank J Bisignano : Yeah. I think the thing is, our capabilities around fraud and chargeback management and our capabilities to serve the biggest issuers is very deep. And I think that many times having a third network is very valuable to everybody, both merchants and issuers, and so -- and STAR and Accel, we've invested heavily in them. And that's why we get the type of transaction growth you're seeing there. So, we really, really love our debit networks. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. Fantastic. Thanks. Frank J Bisignano : So thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Stay safe and have a great day. Operator : [Operator Closing Remarks]",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons.  Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Before I turn the call over to Frank, please note that going forward, we will be using the term organic constant currency revenue to replace internal revenue. There is no change in how we calculate this measure, just a change in terminology.  And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda.  As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs, to mid market, to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. We are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the U.S. We remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth. Turning to our performance. We had a strong third quarter, with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 34.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 23% to $1.47. We attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. To date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger.  As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following : first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of unmet operating loss carryforwards.  On the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted EPS. We now expect organic constant currency growth of 11% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. This raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year.  Turning to the business segments, let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class, omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. We achieved all of this throughout 3 growth platforms : Clover for small business, Clover Connect for ISV and Carat for enterprises.  Driving into our performance, Merchant Acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year, with North America and international largely in line with the segment average for the quarter. Our global merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new merchants across all regions. The quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. North America volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. Excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our JVs, North America volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively.  Next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with Clover. GPV grew 47% year-over-year or a 39% CAGR since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. As part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants. This transaction will expand our Clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience, from quick and casual to fine dining. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the Clover platform, including Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover inventory as well as our unique Clover app marketplace.  On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform, continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. Global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows, with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and buy online, pickup in store, grew 35% in the quarter. We had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson and Caesars Entertainment. We also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with Microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. In the quarter, we added PayPal and Venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global service platform, submitting Carat as a leader in digital payouts with over $10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis.  Additionally, we are building a new partnership with Bakkt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider Bakkt will utilize Fiserv's industry-leading funds-in, funds-out solution. And together, Fiserv and Bakkt will develop new crypto use cases for both merchant and FI clients.  Moving to Clover Connect. The strength of our ISV focused offering showed through the third quarter with ISV volume up 71% year-over-year. Clover Connect allows us to bring together 2 strong Fiserv assets : the world-class hardware and software platform on Clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of CoPilot, which gives ISVs a unique view into all of the merchants' activities, ranging from merchant application processing to support. Our commitment to being the best partner for ISVs is resonating. We signed 47 new ISVs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. We continue signing up ISVs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. This quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways.  Before I address our international progress, I'd like to highlight another focus area in our merchant business, point-of-sale lending. We are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses small, medium and large to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like Clover. We currently have referral agreements with Zip, Citizens Pay and Bread. We're also working with our FI clients to bring payer BNPL offerings to market. For example, we are partnering with Synchrony to offer buy now, pay later solutions on our card processing platform, Optus. Synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through Clover. On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our Merchant Acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. The global expansion of Clover platform into APAC, Latin America and EMEA are all currently in flight. We're on track to roll out Clover in India by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity given the size and growth potential of the market. Clover is already in market in Argentina and is expected to launch in Brazil next year, thereby covering the 2 largest markets in Latin America. In EMEA, Clover is in market across the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, with a further boost expected with the rollout of the Deutsche Bank JV that we announced last quarter. Among the key APAC deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from Bank of China for their fast-growing Macau market. Moving to EMEA, Fiserv partnered with PostFinance, one of the largest financial institutions in Switzerland, to provide credit card acquiring services to their Swiss merchant clients. We're starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the PostFinance today, with plans to expand to the entire merchant base of 60,000 over time.  Fiserv is also supporting Restaurant Brands, owner of iconic brands, including Burger King and Popeyes, as the company expands its footprint across Europe with an omnichannel approach. Fiserv will provide acquiring services for Burger King in the U.K. and the Nordics and Popeyes in the U.K. To close on the merchant segment. As you may recall, in April, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, one of the largest Brazilian banks. We are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of August and is going extremely well, with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week.  Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. Our Payments segment consists of 3 businesses : global credit processing and output solutions, which we call issuer solutions, which is 40% of the segment; debit processing and debit networks, which we call -- we refer to as card services, also 1/3 of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions, bill pay and our prepaid business.  Our issuer solutions business, which grew just below the overall Payments segment average, is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery, with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high single digits. Note that our credit issuer solutions revenue is driven by number of accounts, not credit volume. However, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. Looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including 3 of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year. We also recently completed PNC's conversion of BBVA's card portfolios through our platform. Our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its COVID lows, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.  Within card services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall Payment segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions driving our issuance and network businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. For instance, in the quarter, our STAR debit network signed an agreement with leading U.S. consumer fintech, Chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. We believe that aligning one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the STAR network and positions the network well for future growth. This was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter.  During our Investor Day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by Fiserv credit card issuing option to community FIs and shared that we were actively exploring this market. We are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent credit program offering, branded Credit Choice, and will launch in Q1 2022. Credit Choice is a fully managed credit card issuing-as-a-service solution that allows our community FIs to offer their customers an FI-branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. Credit Choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions, such as OnDot and SpendLabs to expand into a sizable, new, addressable market for Fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. We have already seen strong, early interest from clients, with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline.  On our Q2 call, we spoke to you about our rich, mobile-first consumer and business offerings powered by recent acquisitions, OnDot and SpendLabs. The early results of the launch have been very encouraging. We completed the integration of the CardHub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms and into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform. We are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects as well as existing CardValet clients, whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated CardHub solution by the end of 2022. In addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, installment payment and dispute management, thereby establishing CardHub as a key differentiator and to drive new sales and client retention.  For our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. It enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage, and catapults the FI's overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks. In the third business, results are mixed. We had good growth in our digital payments activity, led by Zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. Prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our Gift Solutions business. We expect growth to continue, driven by new use cases.  Our bill pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions, continues to grow slower than expected. However, we're extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel, going live later this month as an enabler of PayPal's bill payment functionality within PayPal's new app. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our BillMatrix solution.  Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. We added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 7 competitive takeaways and 2 de novo wins. Our DNA platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions, as evidenced in the Valley National Bank and Dollar Bank wins, with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively.  Abiliti, our modern, cloud-based, API-driven digital banking platform, is seeing great momentum with 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which will drive our clients' digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, sale and SpendLabs. The remaining 12 were new logo sales, with half being core competitive takeaways. We also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem, again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference. We launched our new developer portal, which we call the Fiserv developer studio, towards the end of the third quarter. The developer studio provides rich and expansive API integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire Fiserv ecosystem. Additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting new fintechs : FutureFuel.io and Streetshares, aimed at creating new white space opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively.  We believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in the segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as Abiliti; strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surround solutions, like OnDot and SpendLabs; and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer studio API portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like FutureFuel.io and StreetShares. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic constant currency revenue. This does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. It will be the same definition in calculations we've used in prior quarters. On Slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from GAAP revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. This summary can be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation. Now I will cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 4. We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And we are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial results. Total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 21%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.4 billion. Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. This margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. And we have now actioned $1.16 billion programmed today. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Through September 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company.  Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. This result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses; a working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and a reduction in the net operating loss carryforward benefit. With these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full year. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. Our results were once again driven by strong performance across all 3 platforms : Clover for SMBs, Carat for large businesses and Clover Connect for ISVs. Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% GPV growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis, with growth across all of our distribution channels. With Carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. In addition, Carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands, such as Valero. Continuous leading the high-growth, online EBT space, Carat has launched more than 50 clients to online EBT in the past 12 months. Our ISV volume in this quarter through Clover Connect grew 71% year-over-year and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. We are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. Through September 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%. Turning to Slide 7. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. As Frank outlined in his composition of the segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. Global issuer solutions came in just under the segment average, while bill pay was a headwind. Account to account transfers and P2P solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 65% in the quarter. Debit transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus. Given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the Payments and Network segment's full year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. However, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $650 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44.0% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies. Turning to Slide 8. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the quarter. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4%, within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%.  Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. As Frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. We completed our integration of OnDot card management capabilities into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. Mobile deposits in Q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew nearly 60% over last year. Adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36.0%. However, on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. And we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. We have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase. As Frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants, that we will integrate into Clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 32 to 3.2x. Q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. In July, Fiserv was named to the Disability :IN's Disability Equality Index 2021 Best Places To Work, and in September, received the Silver Torch Award from the National Black MBA Association as Partner of the Year, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and talent and client engagement strategies. During the quarter, we also entered into a multiyear relation with -- into multiyear relationships with Girl Scouts USA and the Russell Innovation Center for entrepreneurship. These partnerships focus on increasing access and opportunity for aspiring women and minorities within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We also expanded our Back2Business program to Detroit and the Washington, D.C.; Maryland, Virginia area as well as internationally with our entry into the U.K. Additionally, during the quarter, we also completed our CDP submission, and for the first time, published our EE0-1 filing on our Internet site. None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I want to ask on Acceptance. I'll ask on Acceptance. Looks like you outperformed the global Visa volume, if I'm looking at this correctly. But the yields turned negative in the third quarter. I know it was positive last quarter. So just a question here on pricing and mix in general for Acceptance. And what the outlook on yields might be here going into the fourth quarter? Robert Hau : Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is Bob. I would attribute largely that variation to the difference between volume and trends of our mix relative to what you might see in Visa as well as the yield. Ever so slightly, that ebbs and flows within the quarter depending on the mix of SMB versus enterprises. Overall, we feel quite good about the overall performance, how we're performing against the overall market and against our peers. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got you. So more mix than pricing. Robert Hau : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Terrific. I think I'll follow up on Tien-Tsin's question, and actually specifically ask about the large processing client roll off that you highlighted. That looks like it's about a 5-point drag on overall volumes in Merchant Acceptance and a larger drag on e-com. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that situation? And specifically, how should we think about how it's affecting revenues. Like if it's a low-yielding client? And then also, is that something now that will take another 3 quarters before it lapsed? Or just any additional detail there would be helpful. Robert Hau : Yes, Lisa. The way to think about this, this is a large client that we processed through a joint venture. We pointed it out in terms of adjusting our volume and transactions for transparency, it has very little impact overall on the actual revenue. And the revenue numbers you see there are as reported, so including that decline. That client is largely off our platform at this point, and so you'll see it from a year-over-year standpoint. But there's no more decline going forward because they're essentially off our platform at the end of third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Nice job. I guess, first of all, just in Acceptance, I think last quarter, you even mentioned Q4 being up sequentially from Q3. I guess, is that still the case? And maybe as I look back on some of the more normal years, it seemed like you'd grow a few percent sequentially in Q4. Just wondering anything in Q3 or Q4 that would disrupt that kind of normal few percent up sequentially pattern? Robert Hau : So you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter sequentially? David Koning : Yes. Just sequential revenue growth in Acceptance. It looks like a few percent up is kind of normal in Q4. Robert Hau : Yes, David, I think it's tough to call anything normal these days. I would expect our fourth quarter to be roughly in line with third quarter sequentially for this year. David Koning : Okay. Okay. Cool. And then I guess, secondly, just Payments, I know you kind of called out how it's going to be within the range. You'd said for maybe at the upper end of the range. Is some of that anything that's falling into 2022 now? Were there any maybe delays in implementations? Or anything there that just kind of makes '22 now a little better than it previously would have been? Robert Hau : Yes. I wouldn't call it any delays per se, but we highlighted a few growth drivers that we'll see into 2022 : a couple of the new wins, PayPal going live. We signed a new large U.S. telecom that will go live soon. And of course, the announcement of Credit Choice will help us as we launch that program. As Frank pointed out, we're now in pilot. We're seeing very strong demand for that program, for something that we had not formally announced yet. So we're just now announcing that. So we have some good early read on that. And of course, we'll have CardHub, the offering that we acquired through OnDot, for a full year next year. And that is now fully integrated into our Mobiliti platform, and we continue to build out that capability. Frank Bisignano : We also have those -- 3 of the top 25 issuers that are beginning onboarding. So that will be within the numbers next year. And you heard us talk about us converting BBVA onto our platform also for our client, PNC. So -- and you're going to continue to get the Zelle ramp in there also as that continues to grow and we onboard more. So I think those all will factor into next year's numbers. Operator : Next, we have James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to ask a little bit more of a strategic question. I appreciate all the color on near-term trends and benefits that you're getting from new customer wins. But Frank, it seems like you have picked up a little bit the pace of acquisitions, at least the announced ones recently. Can you talk about how you're feeling about potential and importance of doing acquisitions as part of your FIS or as part of your overall strategy, and if that's evolving at all? And I guess tied to that, Bob highlighted the balanced capital allocation. But I'm wondering if it makes sense to accelerate debt paydown a little bit to improve optionality in case bigger deals come along. Frank Bisignano : Well, maybe I'll talk about what we've been doing on M&A, and how we're looking at M&A. And I think the first thing is, whether it's M&A or building out businesses, we're investing organically and inorganically. And I think the thing that, hopefully, you see is our agility and speed and innovation. We talked about OnDot, and it's fully integrated beyond its initial capability and now in our mobile product and winning in the market. You see us go and look at BentoBox. And we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that will start with restaurants, but actually could be a storefront and much larger. But all of these are nurturing good, strong startups that then we'll allow to thrive in our environment. And we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow. And you hear how we bring SpendLabs along with it. So I think you should expect us to continue that and realize that -- I think we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself. In some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from CardValet to CardHub to an integration. So you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions. But we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically. And we will invest organically in the acquisitions to allow them to thrive within our ecosystem and not to be stand-alone entities. Robert Hau : And then, James, as far as paying down debt, we've seen a significant reduction or improvement in our leverage, now at 3.2x. Back when we completed the merger, we were just over 4x. But we continue to generate good free cash flow. And as you may recall, back at our Investor Day last December, we talked about the capital to deploy over the next 5 years of more than $30 billion. As we enter 2022, not only will we have very strong cash flow, but we will also have capacity on the balance sheet. As EBITDA grows, the company will naturally delever. And so we'll have the capability to borrow just to maintain that historic leverage ratio. So we feel like we're very good -- positioned to be able to complete acquisitions that we feel we want to complete. It's not prohibited or constrained by capital. Operator : Next, we have Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Just wanted to start with a follow-up on the -- that large processing client that is coming out of the numbers here. I guess it looks like it's an e-com client just based on how much it impacted the e-com volume numbers specifically. And was this just a competitive situation that was becoming too price intense from your guys' perspective? Just wanted to get a little bit more color because it's fairly sizable, it appears. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean let's go first to -- that volume coming off our system is in our revenue number. So hold that thought, right? I mean -- so when you look at a large processing client off a JV, that's exactly what it sounds like. Which is, first of all, they -- this was long telegraphed by the client. But when we always talked about our business, we knew the RPT on this and never saw it as an real economic impact. Really just a volume impact to our business. And they went in-house. It wasn't a competitive takeaway, and it was part of their strategy. We're happy to support them with our processing capability through our JV for the period of time that we did it. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just on the free cash flow conversion. I just wanted to hone in on what, I guess, were the most significant changes in your expectations versus last quarter. Because I mean, at the end of the day, I know, on a quarterly basis, obviously, working capital can move around. But the full year revenue is coming in right in line with your plan. Presumably, the diminished benefit of the NOL would have been known previously. So is this really just a function of kind of higher CapEx than you anticipated at the end of the day versus what you were thinking last quarter? Robert Hau : Yes. Jason, the way to think about it is, our 11% revenue outlook, certainly at the high end of our original outlook, was 7% to 12%. So we're growing quite a bit faster than we originally expected overall. We are also seeing meaningful opportunities to invest for growth. So to your point, CapEx is higher in terms of spending on creating new capabilities, new products and services as well as integrating the acquisitions that we announced earlier in the year. Things like OnDot, the software development that we're investing there to not only integrate into our existing capabilities, our other products and services, but to create new capability with some of those acquisitions, led us to make the decision to continue to invest in growth and still have very good free cash flow and good cash conversion overall. Operator : Next, we have Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Frank, I wanted to ask you a kind of a broader question. There seems to be some debate or discussion among investors about potential fintech kind of disruptive forces in the marketplace. At the same time, it seems like you guys function as somewhat of an infrastructure or enablement layer for fintechs. I mean even from the call today, you talked about Chime and Baakt and PayPal, and I know there's a slew of others. So can you talk about this tension between fintech as a competitor and a potential disruptor versus fintech as just sort of a high-growth distribution channel for the business? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean I take this as a long-term issue really back in time, right? I mean we're a platform, as we like to say, for everything from fintechs to SMB to large enterprises. And if you think about what we did with Clover, that was opened up a community to the development community, so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for our end users. So my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves, like you see us doing with the SpendLabs, the OnDots. And even Clover was a disruptor of ourselves. And we'll continue to use our platform to enable. And ultimately, we want to serve all communities. So if you think about things we've talked about here, Chime previously, NYDIG, Baakt being an enabler and one of our clients' coin base. You think about us bringing PayPal into the bill payment ecosystem. We are going to use our platform to enable. And then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. So our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continue innovation. And we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. When you think about all of that -- you hear us talk about being a token provider for Microsoft. That's about bringing their authorization rates higher. So I don't really find any conflict here. We have waterfront property. We open up the waterfront property. And our job is to enable commerce, and we get paid for enabling commerce. Operator : Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : I want to hone in on Clover because I know there's been a lot of discussion on what that asset could mean for you. So help us understand. Any more metrics you think makes sense on the success of that asset? Obviously, it continues to grow well. But any other metrics in terms of how big the revenue is from that now? What kind of growth do you anticipate? Maybe any kind of profitability, volume? And then also, is there an opportunity given some disruption we're hearing about in the market around a Chinese competitor having some challenges on their terminals in the market now? I think they have 1 million -- 3 million or so terminals that might be challenged now. Could there be a replacement opportunity for Clover on that? Robert Hau : Yes, Darrin. It's Bob. Overall, obviously, we are quite pleased with the progress and the continued growth prospects of Clover. GPV up 46%, just under $200 billion for third quarter on an annualized basis. We continue to invest in new capabilities and expand our reach there. As you know, a large proportion -- about 90% of that volume is new to Fiserv, and so that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall and continue to expect that going forward. We're adding capabilities. BentoBox, as a great example, is building out some of the verticals. Across that capability, we have significant, strong distribution channels. And with the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture, we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we didn't see us have a few years back. And so we continue to see good opportunity there. And in terms of the terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own Clover devices. We also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. And we have a variety of different providers of those terminals, and no disruption to us at this point. Frank Bisignano : Yes. And I would just add, Clover is a platform of choice. You heard about the international expansion of that. And I would think that as people are making choices going forward with disruption, for others, that will just further accelerate our growth. Darrin Peller : Yes. Yes. I would think that could be an opportunity for you to take a lot of share in the U.S., at least with what's going on there. A quick follow-up is just on the cash flow and the capital deployment. Just given what normalized earnings could be, how strongly -- or would you consider a more material accelerated share buyback by any chance just given you're now -- you probably will be at about that 2.8 turns leverage target, let's call it, at the end of the year? Robert Hau : Yes, Darrin. I think the way we think about capital deployment has been and remains quite consistent and quite balanced. We continue to focus on growing the business organically, doing value-accretive inorganic growth, i.e., acquisitions. And then, obviously, always looking to return cash to shareholders where appropriate. I don't think you ought to anticipate us doing a large buyback. As you know, we're essentially in the market every quarter and have been for years, short of the short period of time between announcing and closing our merger back in 2019. And we'll continue to be a disciplined capital allocator. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Timothy Chiodo : I wanted to dig in a little bit more with 2 mix-related questions on Clover. And you sort of alluded to in the last question, but hopefully, we can get some of the mix percentages. So first would be around the portions of revenue. So a large portion would be payments related. But also, you highlighted at the Investor Day some increasing software attach; strength in value-added services; and then also, clearly, there's the hardware component. So even if you could just give sort of rough breakdown of those components. And then the second part is around mix and distribution. So you alluded to some of the various channels, whether it be direct, in bank partners, retail ISO, wholesale ISO, even just broad strokes on the mix of distribution would be really helpful. Robert Hau : Yes, Tim. So a couple of things to think about there. One, in terms of channel, we are seeing broad growth across all of our channels, whether it's through partners, through ISV, ISOs, through obviously our joint ventures as well as, as I mentioned in a previous question, building out our direct channel. We have, have had and continue to be focused on having a very wide breadth of distribution capabilities and continue to focus on winning in all of those channels. And that remains -- it has been and will continue to be a broad focus of ours. And then in terms of breakdown of revenue, we haven't given detail around the mix of hardware versus software versus processing. Obviously, the vast majority of our revenue in the Merchant Acceptance business is the merchant acquiring revenue inside of Clover. Obviously, we've got hardware that we sell. But the magic to Clover is you sell the hardware and then you have a processing client, a merchant acquiring client for years and years with high attach and high attainment rate. And we continue to focus on that. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut for -- from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Within Merchant Acceptance, what impact are you seeing on your payment volume when a competitive buy now, pay later solution is added at one of your e-commerce clients? And in particular, I'd appreciate your help with 2 things : Number one, are you retaining the merchant acquiring or merchant processing when a BNPL company is added? Or are they bringing in their own merchant acquirer? And number two, do you have any insights into funding mix when BNPL gets added at one of your clients in terms of debit ACH versus credit? Robert Hau : Yes. I think a couple of things. Number one, we have a number of referral partners. And over the last several quarters, we've announced these or talked about these, whether it's Zip or Bread or Citizens Pay. We continue to be focused on enabling multiple options for our merchants. And obviously, we're the merchant acquirer for those merchants, and so providing that capability maintains that relationship with those merchants. And in terms of credit versus ACH, et cetera, I think broad industry view is, today, a large portion of that -- paying for buy now, pay later activity is actually paid or are finally executed through card payments. David Togut : So you're not seeing any specific mix in terms of ACH when you look across kind of BNPL adoption at your customers. Robert Hau : No. I think the key there is, while buy now, pay later has a high volume in terms of news, it's still a relatively small portion of the overall GPV or merchant space and not moving the needle. And in fact, in some instances, instead of one transaction, you're actually seeing 4 transactions. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan Dolev : Can you give us some color on the -- what's implied in the fourth quarter organic growth guidance for the 2 other segments, for Payments and Fintech? That would be great. Robert Hau : Dan, you were quite muffled. Can you repeat that question? Dan Dolev : Can you give us some color on what's implied by the guidance, the organic growth guidance for the other 2 segments, Fintech and Payments and Networks? Robert Hau : Yes. So I think I tried to give some of that color in our prepared remarks. In our FinTech segment, year-to-date, we're now at 4%. And we expect for the full year to be in that medium-term outlook range of 4% to 6%. And then in our Payments segment, again, relative to kind of our medium-term guidance, our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%, we expect to be in that range. That is adjusted from previously, where we expected to be at the high end of the -- toward the high end of the range. Right now, I'd say just in the range. And year-to-date, we're at 5%. Operator : And that was our last question for today's call. Frank Bisignano : I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day, and thank you for everything. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise noted, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. As a reminder from our last earnings call, we will now be using the term organic revenue, which has replaced internal revenue and is still calculated on a constant currency basis. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. As we exit the second year of pandemic, we had another successful year of delivering on our growth agenda. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year at the high end of our 7% to 12% outlook that we originally provided at our December 2020 Investor Day. We expanded full year adjusted operating margins by 250 basis points. We also achieved 26% growth year-over-year in adjusted earnings per share to $5.58, well above our original outlook of $5.25 to $5.45. Our merchant platforms, Clover and Clover Connect for small- and medium-sized businesses and Carat for enterprises are showing very strong growth. We are winning in omnichannel and seeing strong growth in value-added services such as Clover software, fraud, risk, lending and payment flows, including disbursements and cross-border. Our acquisitions of BentoBox and NetPay give us the assets to enhance self-service offerings in verticals like restaurants and allow us to power new flows via paybacks. We are successfully meeting our FI clients' goal of driving digital engagement through our best-in-class online and mobile banking platform ability as well as integrated mobile-first surround solutions such as CardHub, featuring Ondot for retail customers and SpendLabs for small business customers. Recall that we bought Ondot and SpendLabs in 2021 and are already seeing great traction with them. We expect these solutions will have a positive effect, strengthening our client value proposition across core banking, payment processing and the network business. We made outstanding progress on the integration of Fiserv and First Data. The fourth quarter marks the completion of our cost synergy program. We achieved our target of $1.2 billion, $300 million above our original commitment and 2 years ahead of schedule. We actioned $480 million of revenue synergies and are now at 80% of the increased commitment of $600 million. We anticipate obtaining the full $600 million of revenue synergies by the end of this year, 18 months ahead of schedule. Strengthening our leadership as our clients' partner of choice yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in Finxact. We were an initial investor in Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions that is powering digital transformation across financial services. This is an investment in the next-generation financial technology that supports our strategy to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. Finxact will not only augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions we offer to our existing clients, but also broaden our solutions to include large financial institutions, fintechs, banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities. We've worked closely with the Finxact team and look forward to welcoming Frank Sanchez, his leadership team and the entire Finxact organization to Fiserv when the deal closes later this year. Our business momentum and investments thus far position us very well for the future. Accordingly, we have good visibility into accelerating our organic growth to a rate of 7% to 9%, above our average for the last 3 years and in line with our medium-term outlook. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS to be $6.40 to $6.55, which is a growth of 15% to 17%. This, when combined with the 26% growth we delivered in 2021 will generate a 2-year compounded annual growth of 21%, above the high end of our medium-term outlook range of 15% to 20%. Turning to the business segments. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We continue to focus on investing in our leading merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat, to provide products and services that expand our addressable market and to drive growth for our clients in the SMB and enterprise space. These operating systems continue to perform well and were key drivers of merchant acceptance organic revenue growth of 19% and 20% for the quarter and year, respectively.  Clover continues to be the commerce and business management platform of choice for SMBs in the U.S. and around the world. In 2021, as small business recovery took hold, merchants turned to Clover for leading in-store payment solutions, online commerce capabilities and new vertical services to grow their business. We completed our acquisition of BentoBox, a leading digital ordering and delivering management platform to help out close to 200,000 restaurant owners on our platform reach more customers. In addition to BentoBox, we signed a variety of strategic partnerships to enhance the tools restaurants need to be successful. One such example is our new partnership with Google to enable customers to more easily find and order from Clover restaurant locations. As we roll out these holistic SaaS-based solutions, we see notable increases in the average revenue per merchant. We are very excited about continuing this success and replicating it across other verticals. Closing out 2021, Clover is better positioned than ever as the leading operating system for SMBs. Carat, our omnichannel ecosystem serving enterprise clients continues to grow across the board. We saw particular strength in omnichannel transactions, which were up 51% in 2021. As the demand for omnichannel solutions persisted through 2021, demand for our integrated solutions such as disbursements, payback enablement, EBT and other digital capabilities rose to an all-time high. Disbursements have become an important part of the consumer experience in many verticals through the pandemic. Consumers and businesses want simple, fast access to their money digitally. Carat is well positioned to drive growth in disbursements as evidenced in its expanded relationships with a number of companies within the insurance and ride-sharing sectors as well as digital wallet companies, including marquee brands such as Coinbase.  Turning to our cross-border capabilities, we continue to see strength from the recovery with double-digit cross-border transaction growth in 2021. Looking forward into 2022, we will continue to push deeper into key priority areas, including omnichannel disbursements and cross-border to expand the breadth and depth of services for our enterprise clients. Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Within the issuer business, we saw notable strength in general purpose active accounts, now ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our card business continues to provide growth above the segment average from strength in digital risk solutions, debit network volumes and debit transaction growth. Market-leading innovative solutions like CardHub and SpendLabs are both enhancing revenue and reducing churn. In fact, SpendLabs' product market fit is stronger than we had originally anticipated and this offering, along with CardHub, are notably contributing to our expanded presence with mid-market FIs for card processing solutions. These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offerings, but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, yet again, demonstrating our ability to harness the power of our unmatched distribution platform. Looking to 2022, we expect to see continued momentum from the ramp of our large credit issuer wins in 2020 and 2021, including Alliance Data, Atlanticus and Genesis, 3 top 25 issuers, strengthen our digital offerings with CardHub and SpendLabs and strengthen Zelle. Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, closing out the year up 4%. We finished 2021 strong on sales with 48 new core wins, including competitive takeaways with marquee names such as Valley Bank and Dollar Bank. Not only are we winning in core account processing, but also seeing success in cross-selling pan-Fiserv capabilities to clients. This is demonstrated in our competitive takeaway of Great Southern Bank, an institution with more than $5 billion in assets. With this agreement, Great Southern Bank will be moving to a complete suite of Fiserv offerings across core account processing, digital banking surrounds, card processing and output solutions. We are continuing to win in the higher-growth $1 billion to $50 billion asset segment. Clients continue to choose Fiserv as their strategic technology partner to power combined entities into the future. Key wins in 2021 include NYCB's merger with Flagstar and First Interstate Bank's merger with Great Western. Sales of digital surround solutions grew strong double digits in 2021, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti, our modern online mobile banking platform. We finished the year with 434 sales to existing and new logos. Sales to existing clients helped deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendLabs. It is clear that our solutions are already winning in the market. We will accelerate this momentum through our announced agreement to acquire Finxact, which will enable clients to quickly deploy modular banking services, including deposits, loans, cards as well as launch new banking solutions, including a digital bank, bank-as-a-service and embedded finance. We have already made strides in the category of API development, and the market is recognizing our leadership. In 2021, we are proud to accept an award for the Best in Finance APIs for our Communicator Advantage API platform at the API World Awards and for AllData Connect, our data aggregation portal at the Business Intelligent Group's 2022 BIG Innovation Awards. Looking into 2022 and beyond, the powerful combination of our market-leading banking cores, along with Finxact, which enables clients to launch modern, flexible and highly personalized digital banking experience and ability, our industry-leading online and mobile banking platform will position us to better serve our existing clients and a broader array of customers. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 5. We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the full year, and we are well positioned to achieve a strong 2022 and beyond with sustained value for our clients and our shareholders. As Frank said, we are projecting 7% to 9% revenue growth for 2022, which is 150 to 350 basis points above our average growth over the last 3 years. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 11% to over $4 billion in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted revenue grew 11% to $15.4 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up 11% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year at a very strong 35.6%. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 19% to $5.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 33.9%. We expect 2022 margin to expand an incremental 150 basis points or more above last year. This is driven by strong organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% on a scaled business and a continued focus on productivity, all while we continue to make meaningful investments for organic growth. In addition, as you heard earlier from Frank, we are proud to announce that we reached our $1.2 billion action cost synergy goal in the quarter, which is a result of our disciplined execution to drive value. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.57. And through December 31, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% to $5.58. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 18% from fourth quarter last year, resulting in a conversion of 119%. For the full year, free cash flow was $3.5 billion with a conversion to net income of 94%, driven by strong revenue growth and increases in working capital as well as capital investment and organic innovation for our clients, integration of our acquisitions and investment in technology infrastructure and real estate to create world-class collaboration space for our associates as we return to offices. For 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 95% and 100% of net income, investments in products and services to accelerate growth and the tail end of technology infrastructure and real estate investments, particularly our new technology and innovation hub in North Central New Jersey, which we will occupy later this year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 7. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 19% in the quarter and 20% for 2021. Global transactions and volume grew 13% and 16% in the quarter and 13% and 19% for the year, respectively. Excluding the impact of the exit of a processing client we discussed last quarter, Global Transactions volume grew 18% and 22% in the quarter and 17% and 24% in the year, respectively. Building off one of the best years for merchant location growth, we ended the fourth quarter with 10% higher global merchant locations versus the comparable quarter a year ago. Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as opposed to a very strong 50% GPV growth year-over-year or $201 billion on an annualized basis. We've seen exciting opportunities for Clover this quarter, including our partnership with the University of Notre Dame and the UBS Arena in New York. These wins further strengthen our positioning with sports arenas globally and highlight our success in integrating the Money Pass mobile business we acquired in 2020. Carat, our platform for enterprise clients, saw omnichannel transaction growth of 26% in the quarter, driven by 59 client wins, including notable wins such as Papaya gaming and expanded relationships with Wegmans, a regional supermarket chain with 106 stores and with a leading home improvement client to serve their clients end to end. Our ISV volume this quarter through Clover Connect grew 64% year-over-year and 53% on a 2-year CAGR. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signs to 187 for the year, and we are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. We had several notable international wins in the quarter, including an expanded partnership with UnionPay International, one of the world's largest payment networks to broaden the acceptance of UnionPay cards across Fiserv's global footprint, and with FirstCaribbean International Bank for merchant processing across its banking footprint in the Caribbean region. Additionally, we executed on an agreement with National Australia Bank for merchant processing in Australia. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $533 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points to 31.3%, driven by continued top line strength. Through December 31, adjusted operating income improved 45% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 540 basis points to 30.8%. Before I leave the Merchant segment, as you may have noticed in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we anticipate the sale of a portion of our back book to a merchant alliance partner. This is fully contemplated in our outlook, and will have less than a 50 basis point impact on adjusted revenue for the company in 2022. We expect the transaction to close in the current quarter. Turning to Slide 8. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, resulting in a full year growth of 6%. For the quarter, card services and digital payments outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. Credit came in slightly under the segment average and bill pay continued as a headwind. Within card services, debit transactions grew 14% in the quarter. The strength of our credit offering for financial institutions was manifested in a notable win in the fourth quarter, an agreement with Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, an institution with over $14 billion in assets and over 1 million members to provide our credit processing capabilities. Within issuer solutions, we are well underway with our onboarding the $120 million of new business we announced at our December 2020 Investor Day as well as other mandates awarded since. We have completed the onboarding of Atlanticus, a competitive takeaway; and BBVA, an M&A consolidation win. Onboarding is well underway for Genesis, another competitive takeaway, and for Alliance Data. This momentum continues. In addition to the merchant processing wins I mentioned earlier, we also signed long-term card issuing agreements with both National Australia Bank and UnionPay International. These wins demonstrate our ability to serve our clients on multiple fronts. Consumer demand for content count and P2P offerings continued with Zelle transactions up 71% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. Finally, within bill pay, we have 2 notable fourth quarter wins in the health care vertical, demonstrating our strength in this high-growth segment of the market and broadening our client base from what has traditionally been the utilities and telecom focused offering. Blue Shield of California, a leading health plan in California, has chosen to extend the relationship with Fiserv as part of their enterprise-wide process of digital transformation. Additionally, CareSource, a nationally recognized nonprofit health care plan competitively selected Fiserv to improve their member experience through our robust technology platform. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $713 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 46.2% in the quarter, given tough comps. Q4 operating margin was the second highest margin recorded for the segment, second only to Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $2.6 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 44.1%. Turning to Slide 9. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year within our medium-term outlook for this segment. Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, we added 14 new core account processing clients, bringing us to 48 core wins in the year, more than half of which were takeaways. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 9% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 52% over last year. Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter to $287 million and up 9% year-to-date to $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 37.3%. For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 35.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for both the quarter and full year was 20% and in line with our expectations. We expect 2022's effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, up slightly as 2021 benefited from a few discrete tax planning items. 2021 was another demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes fortifying our strong balance sheet, returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, driving organic growth through investment and pursuing high-value acquisitions. We invested approximately $850 million in M&A to acquire capabilities that we are best positioned to deploy across our scaled platform. We completed our acquisitions of BentoBox, NetPay and Integrity Payments, bringing our total transactions to 7 in 2021. And as Frank mentioned, we further strengthened our portfolio through the announced acquisition of Finxact, a developer of cloud-native banking solutions. Additionally, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase this year, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter for 9.9 million shares. We have more than 42 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. And finally, total debt outstanding was $21 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.1x, down nearly a full turn since we merged. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the goals we've accomplished with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, as well as our history of strong operational performance, we believe we will deliver 7% to 9% organic revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted earnings per share growth to a range of $6.40 to $6.55. We expect each of our business segments to deliver organic revenue growth within the range of our medium-term outlook. Finally, I invite you to participate in an investor call we will be hosting in the next several weeks focused on our merchant acceptance business with a particular emphasis on Clover as a key driver of growth for the segment and the company. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. Our approach to corporate social responsibility is designed to incorporate a philanthropic, associate and community engagement to deliver thoughtful, strategic decisions where we invest our time and talent. Diversity and inclusion remains on the top of our ESG agenda and the results of our efforts speak for themselves. In January of the current year, Fiserv was named to the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, marking our sixth consecutive year for this recognition. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated a best place to work for LGBTQ+ equality in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index. Now in its 20th year, the CEI is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees. Since 2020, we have allocated $35 million of the $50 million commitment designed to help small minority-owned businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated initiatives. In Q4, Fiserv was ranked #4 on Military Times Best for Vets Employers list, the fifth year in a row in the top 5 and #1 ranked in our category. Continuing our initiatives to support better and affiliated businesses, this quarter, we announced an extension of our partnership with the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University. And during our fourth quarter season of giving campaign, associate donations along with corporate matching donations from Fiserv contributed to over 1,200 community groups globally. I am proud of the positive impact of philanthropic and community programs have had in 2021, and I look forward to us doing more in 2022 to help businesses and communities thrive. I will close by thanking all 40,000-plus hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Good stuff here. I had a question with just hoping to drill in a little bit on your outlook for Merchant Acceptance for 2022. I know you mentioned you're expecting it to return to the medium-term range. I think that's 9% to 12%. So are you expecting Merchant Acceptance to get back to double-digit growth? And then could you drill in a little bit on 2 of the big drivers in there, what you're looking for out of Clover and then maybe what you're looking for out of your international business as you look out into 2022 to give you confidence in that outlook? Frank Bisignano : So first of all, yes, 9% to 12%. And yes, we're driving business to double digit. I think there's a multipronged effort here. And obviously, we have a lot of assets in the portfolio that are performing very, very well, whether it be our ISV business, whether it be in Carat. But specifically, the growth in Clover, we believe, will happen both in the U.S. and then in our global expansion on it also. And we continue to see that have very, very strong visibility and how deployment will happen outside the U.S. during the course of this year. And then you layer on top of that the Caixa partnership, the [ Deutsche ] partnership, and you can see us extending out in all regions, really. So you should expect to see Clover growth. You should expect to see geographic expansion. But you should also expect to see strong e-comm trajectory along with ISV trajectory as we continue to invest in Clover and Carat and the ISV business and continue to fuel our international growth. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Really happy to see the 7% to 9% organic revenue growth for this year. I want to ask just on the margin outlook to get there for the segments. Where are you investing more aggressively? I know you have some integrations and implementations to do as well plus productivity. So any color there would be terrific. Robert Hau : Yes, Tien-Tsin, I'll start and Frank can jump in. I think you'll see continued investments in all 3 of our segments. Obviously, each one of them have a slightly different growth trajectory. As Frank just talked in answering Lisa's comment about the 9% to 12% merchant growth, we expect all 3 of our segments to perform in the medium-term outlook range, 4% to 6% for the Fintech segment and 5% to 8% for payments.  And you're seeing us focus on bringing new solutions to our clients on where they want us to meet, obviously, really across the board, the continued drive for digital, for mobile expanding out our capabilities to integrate all of our solutions. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about the new wins with UnionPay and with National Australia Bank, 2 individual contracts that both had merchant and payments incorporated in them. And so we'll continue to invest in building out those capabilities. We continue to invest in our digital capability around our CardHub acquisition with Ondot, with SpendLabs. Our Abiliti solution, our bank -- digital banking solution that we launched earlier this year, a cloud-native online banking solution will continue to expand in the marketplace. And obviously, once we close with Finxact, it will be a focus of ours as we build out that capability. Frank Bisignano : Maybe I'd say 1 or 2 other things. We have tremendous visibility due to the amount of wins you've heard us talk about. You could see that we have had very, very good momentum in the sales cycle, and that's all about future growth. I also think the investments we are making are for future growth. So the 7% to 9% we're talking about here in the medium term is what's right in front of us, and we have good visibility to it. But we also are integrating a lot of products building for the future, being very offensive towards how we're going to build. And so when you think about our spending, it's really not against this year's revenue, it's for future years' revenue. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Wanted to see what color you might give us just on Omicron impacts you may have felt in December and January, particularly in Merchant, but maybe a little bit on the issuer processing side, too. And then just how that translates into how we should be thinking about first quarter revenue growth by segment. I know you generally have some pretty easy comps there in Q1. Frank Bisignano : I'll start, Bob could fill in. I mean it definitely had an effect. We saw it as we came through December. You definitely felt it, and outside the U.S., more than even inside the U.S., I'd say. But -- and it has spilled into January across basically dividend credit when you think about it and affect the spending in general. But I view that as a short-term issue, nothing systemic there. .  Bob, anything you want to add? Robert Hau : No, Jason, I think January, consistent to how we kind of closed out December, a little bit light. Obviously, the U.S., Europe, the globe is dealing with Omicron. We're starting to see the restrictions in Europe lifted, particularly in U.K., Ireland. Germany has still got a number of restrictions in various regions. It's not a country-wide program, it's region by region, and we're starting to see those lift. And so we expect things to improve as we progress through the quarter. I do expect each of the 4 quarters to be within that 7% to 9% range. So I don't think we have any quarter that's well below that and another quarter well above that. But with January being a little bit lighter, there could be some impact to Q1 there. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Nice year. So I guess a couple of questions. First of all, on payments, 2021, it looked like full year about 5.5% organic, and you're kind of saying 5% to 8% would be 2022. So I'm just kind of thinking through the accelerating and decelerating factors, like I would think debit probably decelerates. But then what should accelerate to kind of propel growth in '22 to offset the debit deceleration? Frank Bisignano : Yes. We have seen some of that deceleration in debit. Again, it was part of the December to January dynamic. We certainly see some nice lift from the credit issuer wins that started going live really the second half of 2021. So we've got good lift from those in the full year of 2022. And with Atlanticus and ADS yet to onboard here in early 2021, that will give us some nice lift. So I think our credit issuing business will perform nicely. The improvement or the new contract wins that we talked about in bill pay will help stem some of that headwind that we dealt with in 2021. And broadly, the contract wins and the implementations and new services, CardHub is certainly having an impact on both our debit and credit business as we bring a more fulsome solution, very digital, state-of-the-art capability into our clients. And we see some real opportunity there. David Koning : Got you. And just secondly, the Acceptance segment, I was kind of looking back. It looks like the last few years mostly were down kind of 3% to 5% sequentially in Q1. You also mentioned selling the back book. I don't know how much impact that has. But is -- are we in kind of a pretty normalized like maybe down 3%, 5% sequentially? Frank Bisignano : Yes. So first, the sale of the back book will -- we expect to take place this quarter. We're almost halfway through the quarter. It isn't closed yet, but we do expect it soon. So it will be a modest -- it's a modest impact to the year, less than 50 basis points to the adjusted revenue for the company for the year. So a pretty small impact to Q1, particularly given that it's not yet closed. But I think you're largely in line. I don't expect any difference in terms of the seasonality as you go from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to ask quickly on capital allocation, and you seem to have stepped up the pace of acquisitions recently. And I'm wondering with the slowing in valuations that we've seen at least in public markets, is that creating incremental opportunities for acquisitions, do you think? And how dynamic or flexible can you be on capital allocation, especially between acquisitions, buybacks and debt reduction? Just love to get kind of your sense and color around those topics. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean we talked about $850 million, and then we have Finxact here. Also, I mean we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to deploy capital where appropriate and all of that is to further accelerate growth rate. And I accentuate further accelerate. Two, we think we're darn good at integrating these properties. And the properties that we've acquired, we've also had invested. We invest in properties early, watch them, grow with them, nurture them and integrate them. So I think you should expect that these things are all strategically thought about ahead of time, whether it was a restaurant segment, whether it's our ability to bring a complementary product across our core. Our ability is without scale to be able to acquire some of these founder-led companies and then utilize them across us. I mean you look at an Ondot, and that's already completely deployed, integrated and succeeding in the clients' office. So we feel good about our ability to deploy the capital. We feel good about the platform's ability to scale the use. And they're all to us, middle of the fairway of where our business model is. And that's how you should think about us deploying the capital or against acquisitions. Obviously, we added a very strong year in repurchasing also because we thought it was appropriate to return money to shareholders in that fashion, $2.6 billion. So I think it's a very balanced approach. Robert Hau : James, just to kind of put an emphasis on that last point from Frank, it isn't an either/or it isn't an M&A or a share repurchase. In 2021, we deployed capital across the board. We spent $850 million on M&A. We repurchased $2.6 billion, so returned $2.6 billion to shareholders. That's the highest we've done as Fiserv, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter.  We continue to invest organically. And all that done at the same time, we lowered leverage to 3.1x, down half a turn in the year and really, a full turn since our merger. So our ability is about deploying what is significant free cash flow across the portfolio and in a variety of different ways. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Timothy Chiodo : I want to talk about inflationary impacts to the top line across a few of the segments. Within the Acceptance segment, obviously, there's a little bit of hardware revenue. But with the rest of the revenue, maybe you could just remind us all on the proportion of that, that comes via ad valorem fees or basis points, how much of that is on a cents per transaction or other? And then also within Fintech, maybe you could just touch on the CPI-based pricing escalators worked into the contracts there for core banking. Robert Hau : Sure, Tim. So you had a lot of elements to that question, make sure I hit all of them. First and foremost, as you point out, we have a variety of different methods for revenue generation in our Merchant business, certainly a mix of volume driven as well as transaction driven. And of course, the other element of that is a variety of different distribution channels, whether it's a direct channel or through our partners or through a joint venture. So lots of different ways that, that revenue comes to us. Ultimately, we feel good about the pricing dynamic of the market. Inflation in 2022 will give us a natural lift on the activity that is volume based as volume goes up on higher volume transactions, which can be higher volume activity, we'll get a lift on that. And roughly, in the Merchant business, about 65% of our revenue is volume-based pricing and about 35% is transaction-based. If you turn to the Fintech segment, it's the segment that we probably have the highest level of CPI clauses in our contracts and certainly will be a lift for us in 2022 as those CPI increases go in. I don't have a percentage for you off the top of my head, but it's a good portion of the Fintech or the core account processing portions of Fintech that have a CPI index in it. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Can we just touch on the investments and the capital intensity you're putting into the business? Obviously, it's -- with the strong growth you have, it probably begs the question of whether or not your free cash conversion should stay in this 95% to 100% range versus the historic median term, which I think we kind of anticipated. But I'd just love to hear a little more color on what your thought process is on that. And then also whether or not we still feel good about the $25 billion of free cash over the next few years, $30 billion of capital deployment capabilities. . And then just really one quick follow-up. I thought it was interesting that you guys are hosting this call in the next few weeks on Merchant and Clover. Any kind of preview on what the goal is for that? Is it just to give us more comfort and color on sustainability and the breakdown of the business given how strong growth has been? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Why don't we start with that first? The concept on that is to really get you all to better understand the value being created for each client, that when you think about average revenue per merchant, Clover's impact to give you a real good look at the growth rate. And we talked to you about the e-comm business, too. We said [ covered them both ]. So when you look at it, you could see what that long-term ramp we have in here and the power of both of those platforms. So that would be answering the last part first. We had talked about $30 billion of capital to deploy. That number hasn't changed for us at all, in our changing in a conversion rate here. And if you want to think about what we're doing, I just -- I think it's about delivering integrated solutions as we acquire products, it's about delivering a changed experience ultimately in the client's office, all designed at long-term accelerated growth. So in many cases, we're also building functionality, which has given us a greater total addressable market as we approach it. So it's completely offensive in terms of us leaning into the opportunity. The beauty of this platform is its size and scale and its client base, and that size and scale in that client base avails us more opportunity than we actually imagine when we put the 2 companies together and the complementary nature of the assets and the ability to invest is really about growth. Bob? Robert Hau : Yes, Darrin, the 2 pieces I'd add, I guess is, one, that the $95 to $100 that we have for 2022 and the $94 million we did in '21 is in part driven by our increased spending on really 3 things. One is we are moving with a faster speed than we traditionally have around integrating new acquisitions. So a classic example is we acquired Ondot in the first part of 2021. And within a few months, we had that integrated in some of our mobile banking capability and started selling it as a truly integrated solution where traditionally, we might have taken a bit longer to actually integrate. We might sell it as a bundle, but really integrate it into the software, into the software offering. We're moving at a much faster speed. Secondly, you heard us talk in this -- on the prepared remarks about technology infrastructure spending. It's really associated with the merger of Fiserv First Data and finishing the swing on that. That's capital spending we're doing across our technology infrastructure. And then the third piece is building up some real estate. As we bring our organization back into the office after what's been a couple of years of working from home, we're building out what we think are world-class collaboration spaces to respond to what employees want and need now to enhance that collaboration. You heard us earlier in the year announce our new technology hub, innovation and technology hub in North Central New Jersey. That will be built out and occupied later this year. So that technology infrastructure associated with the Fiserv First Data merger and some of this real estate spend, you'll see kind of tail off at the end of this year, and then we'll see a shift in free cash flow going forward. Operator : And our last question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Just bridging to the earlier question on inflationary impacts on revenue. Could you walk through the impact of inflation on your cost structure and what's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion guidance for 2022? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Well, I would say, first of all, there's definitely a war on talent, and there's definitely an inflation. And when you look in our model, we've accounted for the world we live in within that guide. We are very maniacally focused on how to create these work environments that attract the best talent, retain the best talent and continue driving innovation in a manner that gives us the outcomes that we've been getting and continue to drive forward. You know, Bob, maybe... Robert Hau : Yes. I would punctuate saying, number one, with 7% to 9% top line growth on our scale business that provides some nice operating leverage, that will improve operating margin but also allows us to continue to invest in the company. We also have a long track record of good, strong productivity. The last couple of years that's been called integration savings or synergy. But we continue to have real opportunities for productivity. As such, we feel comfortable that we'll have at least that 150 basis points of margin improvement in 2022. David Togut : Understood. And then is the 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion target for 2022 the new normal going forward as opposed to the 105% plus, which we saw historically? Robert Hau : No, I would not say that. Obviously, at this point, we're not ready to update 2023. But given some of that technology infrastructure spend and the real estate spend that I talk about -- that I talked about earlier, I expect that to drift down as we exit 2022 and beyond. Frank Bisignano : I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks for your time today. Robert Hau : Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients has placed us on the list of the world's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the second consecutive year. We've entered 2022 with strong momentum. We delivered 11% total company organic revenue growth in the first quarter. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 32%. We also achieved 20% adjusted EPS growth to $1.40. We attained $40 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $520 million since the merger, 87% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger, and now expect to hit that goal by the end of this year. As we shared with you on our year-end 2021 earnings call, we concluded our cost synergy program, having actioned the promised $1.2 billion of synergies since the closing of the merger. As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $603 million. The outperformance on the top and bottom line versus our full year guidance ranges puts us in a good position to meet or exceed our full year outlook. As we evaluate the year ahead, we believe it is prudent to leave our 2022 guidance unchanged, given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop with high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical issues looming. Accordingly, we are maintaining our 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.40 to $6.55, representing growth of 15% to 17% for 2022. Now turning to our business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems, Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. This operating systems approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. We grow and create value in 3 ways. First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the organic growth of our existing customer base. Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. In early April, we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions. We have already seen a tremendous amount of interest in the platform from existing and new clients. We believe this acquisition will augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions to existing clients as well as broaden our client base to include large financial institutions and fintechs through banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities. We advanced our strategic focus on data and analytics. This quarter, we announced partnerships with Equifax, Finicity and MX, which will utilize our vast and highly valuable real-time data to create insights to strengthen and create new offerings across fraud, risk and marketing. While early in the journey, we expect data and analytics to be a new growth driver for us. Next, diving deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We posted a very strong organic revenue growth of 20% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, continuing a positive trend since the start of 2021. Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals such as travel and petro. Spending across EMEA was strong in the quarter as restrictions were lifted in the U.K. and The Netherlands in early January, followed by Ireland, Poland and Germany later in the quarter. Travel was particularly strong, followed by restaurants and hospitality. Our merchant business in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter. We've made significant progress in on-boarding merchants through exclusive merchant acquiring mandate from Caixa in Brazil with 140,000 merchants currently on-boarded. In just 1 year since signing the agreement, we are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. Spending trends in APAC were very strong as key markets such as India and Australia continue to resume normalcy, fueling discretionary spend in verticals such as travel, retail and restaurant. In addition to the cyclical rebound, the region has continued to win and implement new business. Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat continue to gain significant traction with clients. Clover's global revenue grew 39% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 39% as well as close to 200 basis points of sequential growth in software and services penetration of revenue to 15%. We continue to make progress on our vertical focus. Starting with restaurants. The integration of BentoBox into Clover is well underway, and the early proof points in both lead conversion rate and ARPU are all very positive. Within the services and retail verticals we are offering merchants leading solutions to address key business functions through a combination of pre-installed apps and tailored vertical SaaS offerings. Carat, the omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20%. We saw broad-based growth across verticals, including travel, government, technology and quick-serve restaurants. In the quarter, we had some impressive wins across omni and e-com acquiring, including a card-not-present acquiring mandate for the leading fantasy sports player, DraftKings; an extension of our long-standing omnichannel partnership with Chick-fil-A; a mandate for fast food brand Jersey Mike's Subs. Within new payment flows, Carat's leadership and digital payouts continues with the doubling of disbursement volume processed in the quarter. During the quarter, we extended our contract with Coinbase to support their launch of an NFT marketplace. We are making rapid inroads into the high-growth markets such as payment facilitators and platforms. The November acquisition of NetPay gives us a differentiated solution in the market, including fully managed on-boarding, risk and funding services to support these high-growth platform businesses. We have seen rapid growth in this end market with new clients signing nearly doubling transactions in the past year. Finally, before closing out the merchant segment, an update on the progress of our point-of-sale lending offering. Our strategy all along has been to leverage our position as the operating platform for businesses, small, medium and large, to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are simplifying the merchant experience through an integration into the Carat operating system for large enterprises and enabling BNPL app downloads through the Clover app market for small and midsized businesses. By enabling our clients to easily connect to BNPL providers of their choice, we are making it possible for them to offer their customers in-demand payment options in an easy-to-manage cost-effective way. Moving to Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers for cross-sell business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 10% versus Q1 of last year. This growth was driven by new business on-boarding and our favorable credit environment. We fully ramped Genesis Financial onto our platform in the quarter, which along with the on-boarding of Atlanticus last year, marked the on-boarding of 2 of the 3 major credit processing mandates we announced in 2020. We had solid growth in our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and debit processing businesses, driven by new wins despite the stimulus-induced tough growth comparisons in the year ago. We've seen impressive growth in engagement metrics across our FIs, driven by market-leading digital solutions like CardHub, SpendTrack, our loyalty platform and our AI-based fraud system. These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offering but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 40% in the quarter. Finally, while we still see softness in our bill payments business, sequential growth rates continue to improve as we create new use cases like bill pay for fintechs, including crypto digital wallets; and enter long-term renewals with large clients, notably U.S. Bank and Regions Bank. Additionally, this summer, we will launch a revamped bill pay interface to elevate the customer experience. Looking ahead, our sales and product pipeline gives us confidence in our ability to grow the payments segment in the 5% to 8% medium-term organic revenue range. Our client wins in the quarter support this momentum. We signed a long-term renewal with a highly valued client, Synchrony, spanning across issuer processing, bank services and merchant acquiring, reinforcing our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our clients. We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the first quarter, we signed a new installment loan provider, Flexiti Financial, in Canada. The debit wins in the quarter included a processing win extending our relationship with KeyBanc; and an integrated debit processing, network and digital surround solutions win with Heritage Federal Credit Union, a $900 million asset size client. These wins showcase the breadth and reach of our debit processing capabilities, spanning from smaller credit unions to some of the nation's largest financial institutions. We also continue to show the power of our enterprise offering and our competitive advantage when working with fintechs. This quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with a new digital financial services company across bank services, credit and debit processing and output services. We will also fully on-board Bread Financial, previously known as Alliance Data, for card processing in the second quarter of this year. The tailwinds from our large-grade implementations, recent debit wins like KeyBanc this quarter, Chime and Great Southern over the last couple of quarters and the investments in our digital surround solutions gives us confidence of continued growth in Payments and Network segment. Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted strong organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. We had 12 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti,  our modern online and mobile banking platform. Sales to existing clients help us deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, thereby creating stickier clients. The competitive landscape continues to evolve quickly, and we believe that our fintech strategy combined with Finxact's modern core capabilities positions us uniquely to offer a full stack of offerings aimed at expanding the addressable market for embedded finance and banking as a service. The linchpin of our fintech strategy is our open finance initiative. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched our new developer portal called the Developer Studio, a platform for exposing our microservice APIs for the developer community with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. Our banking as a service capability enables financial institutions to expose modern fintech solutions to their client base to increase engagement and relevance while extending their reach into new market segments. Our banking as a service capability is also a turnkey solution for fintechs and merchants wanting to offer banking and payment services. We believe we are best positioned to power the ongoing revolution in banking as a service and embedded finance due to our footprint of community financial institutions and breadth of banking and payment capabilities. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some additional operating detail on our 3 segments. If you are following along on our slides, I'm starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, we started off the year strong. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to over $3.9 billion. Our adjusted operating income was up 12% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 32%, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we delivered 360 basis points of margin expansion in the year-ago quarter, resulting in 420 basis points of expansion over the last 2 years. We reaffirm our outlook to deliver at least 150 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.40. Free cash flow was $603 million for the quarter, resulting in a conversion rate of 65%, driven by a combination of : first, increased capital expenditures in the areas of technology and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased hardware inventory to minimize any potential disruption to our clients given the supply constraints; and finally, timing factors impacting cash from one quarter to the next. We reaffirm our outlook to achieve 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 20% in the quarter. Adjusted revenue growth was 18% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, global merchant volume and transactions grew 15% and 10% in the quarter, respectively. Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. In the quarter, Clover posted a strong 39% revenue growth, and quarterly GPV was $49 billion or $197 billion on an annualized basis, 39%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 51% year-over-year. We signed 44 ISVs this quarter. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20% in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 21% to $470 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points to 28.4% as we balanced efficiency gains with continued investment for growth. In the quarter, we completed the sale of certain merchant contracts from an Alliance joint venture that we disclosed last year. As we shared with you on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, the impact of this sale is estimated to be under 50 basis points of total company adjusted revenue. It is fully contemplated in our full year 2022 outlook. Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 5% in the quarter, within our guided range of 5% to 8% for the year. As expected, our credit issuer solutions business saw strong growth, driven by the growth in credit active accounts on file as well as the impact of new clients coming onboard. Our debit processing and network businesses continued to perform well, driven by the compelling value proposition of our digital surrounds even as debit transaction growth decelerated to 3% year-over-year against a very difficult year-ago comparison. Consumer demand for account-to-account and P2P offerings continued with all transactions up 40%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. The offsets in the quarter were the prepaid business, which faced very tough stimulus-driven year-ago comps and bill pay. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $625 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 42.5% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, including 100 basis points from periodic revenue. Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $275 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points to 35.4%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million in the quarter, in line with the average of the last 4 quarters. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, 10 basis points higher than last year. The 2022 adjusted effective tax rate should continue at the same quarterly pacing as last year and is expected to be approximately 21% for the full year. Additionally, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases this quarter. We have more than 37 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on March 31, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.0x as we approach our target leverage level. Turning to a new slide, Slide 8. We highlight our balance sheet performance and capital allocation results over time. We've made meaningful strides to lower our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by over 0.5 turn from Q1 last year and a full turn since the merger. Over the last 2 years, we've generated $7 billion of free cash flow and have allocated $4.9 billion towards a combination of M&A and share repurchases, representing 5% of shares outstanding. Additionally, we have deployed $2.1 billion over that time towards debt repayment and integrations, both of which are expected to significantly decline as we completed the integration of the First Data and Fiserv merger at the end of last year and approach our goal of under 3x debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage. This will allow us to allocate even more capital to value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase. Finally, turning to Slide 9. Although we outperformed on adjusted revenue and EPS for the first quarter, we feel it's prudent to keep our 2022 outlook unchanged. Given that it is still early in the year and the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I am very proud of the results we've accomplished this quarter. As diversity and inclusion continues to be at the top of our CSR agenda, we are focused on ensuring alignment and investment into our employee and community engagement strategies. In the first quarter, in addition to the Fast Company most innovative recognition I mentioned earlier, Fiserv was named as a 2022 Great Place to Work in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Mexico. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated by VETS Indexes as a 5-star employer. In addition, our Nenagh technology center in Ireland has been recognized as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. Fiserv has activated several initiatives in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including financial grants for our associates, direct donations to local not-for-profit organizations and other humanitarian programs for civilians displaced in the region. We've also activated a matching donation campaign in support of American Red Cross efforts. A quick note that our 2021 CSR report will be finalized and published in the coming weeks. As I close, I would like to thank all 40,000-plus hardworking associates around the world for working relentlessly to service our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. . Tien- Tsin Huang : I had a couple of questions. The first one, on the acceptance segment, obviously, very strong there. It looks like volume growth matched Visa's but the revenue growth did exceed that. So what's driving the higher revenue spread to volume in this quarter? And what should we expect here going -- as we go through the balance of the year? And I had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Robert Hau : Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think there's -- like we saw in previous quarters, there are a number of differences between our volumes and Visa's volumes and the international mix and cross-border mix, et cetera, et cetera. So as you said, we're in line from a volume standpoint. We had good revenue growth overall. As we've talked, yield is a metric that ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. The last couple of quarters, the math has been a little bit weaker. This quarter, it's quite strong. I think there's a lot of variation in there. And it's one of the things we continue to point to, that we're quite focused on revenue growth and margin expansion, a little less so on the yield because of that quarterly variation. Clearly very pleased with the performance of our merchant segment with good, very strong growth continuing in Clover, good growth in Carat and across the board. Having a 20% organic revenue growth for the segment in the quarter is a great start to the year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. So let me ask my quick follow-up, if you don't mind, just on the free cash conversion. I heard the CapEx and opportunistically buying some terminals here, but you're keeping the full year at 95% to 100% the same. So what's the outlook for some of the moving pieces here to drive that confidence in getting to that 95% to 100%  for the full year? Frank Bisignano : I think -- it's Frank. First of all, it was way more than physical terminals. It was component parts also, and we thought it was a very prudent and smart move to buy ahead into the supply chain given the volume opportunities we have across the board which drive growth. So that would be clearly in the one-timer inventory category. Obviously, we see -- as we reiterate our confidence on margin also, we see the ability to grow and expand margins as part of the confidence story going forward. And obviously, these are ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter also and timing of capital. So I think about it in those manners. We feel great about the growth. We feel good about our ability to expand the margins. And we feel good about the ability of what we bought ahead actually thrive, grow and not have that expenditure going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : I'll take payments and networks, I guess, which came in at the lower end of your long-term outlook of 5% to 8% there. I know there's a lot of moving pieces within payments and networks. You highlighted, I think, both some lapping effects of stimulus hitting the prepaid business and the debit business but then also the bill payment business, which has been a bit of a struggle coming out of the pandemic. Can you just parse those apart a little bit, meaning what was sort of onetime versus lapping issues related to stimulus in the quarter versus where we might see more of a protracted drag as we go throughout the year? And then I have a quick follow-up as well. Robert Hau : Sure, Lisa. So within the payments segment, stimulus certainly created a tough compare to Q1 of last year with our prepaid business. And as we saw really late '20 and into '21, a consumer shift of credit to debit, which we think was stimulus-driven, we're now starting to see that kind of revert back to mean or to norm with more move to credit than it is debit. Of course, as you know, we get paid on a per transaction basis on the debit side, but on a credit processing side in the payments segment, we're paid on gross active accounts. And so now we're seeing a nice lift in the number of accounts, but the transaction shift from debit to credit doesn't manifest itself in revenue directly. So good growth in our credit business this quarter versus Q1, still had growth in debit but not as high as we had all of last year. Debit Q1 of last year was quite weak and came back throughout the year. And then in the bill pay and biller side, we've actually seen an improvement of the headwind. So it's still an issue for us. And we talked to a couple of things that we see, things beginning to improve over probably the last 2 quarters. The rate of growth decline has improved quite a bit. And as we go live with a number of new clients, particularly in the fintech space, and as we launch the new user interface this summer, we see continued opportunity to improve both in the bill pay/biller business but also in payments overall. And of course, as we now have implemented 2 of the big 3 credit issuers, with the third one going live here late second quarter, you'll see accelerating growth from the credit issuer side of the business. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Got it. Okay. A quick just follow-up maybe for Frank on the new -- I guess, new highlight around advanced data and analytics with these partnerships with Equifax and Finicity, et cetera. Can you just give maybe a little bit of color or examples of the types of offerings there? And is this kind of new revenue stream or is this more of a win rate stickiness dynamic in the bank base? Just elaborate a bit... Frank Bisignano : No, it's a new revenue stream. We've always believed that we had a data advantage. And we did some things organizationally, maybe you remember, at the top of the house where we've dedicated talent against it, and it is manifesting itself. We have a pretty good road map to capabilities to offer to our clients and then to jointly offer with partners and combining capabilities. That is why we believe when we come into the latter part of this year and then going into next year, a completely new revenue stream with high margins in those capabilities in providing real-time data, in providing decisioning data, and that's what we have right now. We do see the opportunity, as we said, in marketing and other information. We yet -- haven't proved out that proof of concept yet, but the others have been proved. And we expect to be in market at the latter quarter of this year. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : First, on the growth side, on the top line, I just want to touch on both -- first, the fintech segment. When we look at the growth, it does seem like mid-single digits seem pretty resilient now. And on top of the Finxact acquisition and what that can do, I'd love to hear more thoughts on what that can actually do to add to business given the pipelines you're seeing. But CPI price escalators potentially built in, to what extent do you expect to push those through this year? And can that also contribute? Frank Bisignano : The one I'd talk about, I think the team in fintech and their maniacal focus on how to serve the client and growth is showing up. We had an expectation that we would get to these type of levels. And when we laid it out in December of 2020, I think the action plans in that team and the product innovation and bringing all the components of the company where we think we have a strategic advantage actually got us to where we are today. I think our digital assets play very, very well. So I talked about those surrounds. Our ability to have a good digital lens really is a strategic advantage. And then you saw us do things like bringing Ondot into Mobiliti, which also is a one-of-a-kind offering. And when that all comes together in the client's office, it gets us to where we are today. I think thinking beyond today, Finxact is very strategic. It -- as we had said, we think it expands our TAM capability. And we think over the long haul, a combo of our assets plus Finxact, allow us to get to other markets we weren't intending to before. So when you look at it, we feel great about the job the team has done. The Finxact acquisition, as you know, 20-plus days closed, and that's moving along very, very well. The integration of the team and the ability to deliver what we expect over the next few years from that, we have clear line of sight, we believe. And I think that's how we think about the totality of our current business, our digital offerings and our future digital offerings and expanding the total addressable market that we were addressing around that segment. Robert Hau : And Darrin, in terms of CPI, we do get -- particularly in our core account processing business, a typical contract does allow for annual CPI changes. Those are very typically annual items. So at the end of the year, we calculate the CPI index and apply it to the next year's billing. And contracts vary. Some have caps, some have full CPI, and it varies across the board. But that is fully baked into, first of all, our guidance. You're seeing it in the Q1 results. And because it's an annual bill, that's locked for the year. Darrin Peller : I have one quick follow-up -- that's helpful. But Frank, just from an M&A standpoint, when we think about what you just said, the leverage level now below 3. Obviously, opportunistic buybacks make a ton of sense. But at the same time, there's definitely valuations coming in across the market. So can you just revisit your preference in terms of capital allocation going forward and what types of assets? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I think we've demonstrated a pretty balanced approach to our capital allocation, both if you look at what we did with Finxact or if you look what we've done with BentoBox or Ondot. And you'd find all of them really leaning into helping our clients grow their business with their clients in a digital framework. So I put that out there because it is largely about addressing new markets, new opportunities and how, in fact, we help our clients grow their business, which, in fact, would become the beneficiary also. And you should expect that mindset around future acquisitions, which is just another form of investing for growth. You just saw and Bob talked through that 29% over the last 24 months of our capital allocation went into merchant integration expense and debt paydowns. And that capital is now deployable, and obviously, we will continue to have a better growth rate. And I think you should expect that we will use the same methodology of investing for growth where we believe we can leverage our assets inside the house to bring other market opportunities, and we'll be buying back the shares opportunistically and returning those dollars to our shareholders as we always have in that tried and true methodology. And we feel kind of great about what we've done so far on the capital allocation. Hope you guys do, too. And we feel even stronger about it going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Great job. And I guess my first question, you had the investor meeting a few -- a handful of weeks ago and talked about 11.5% growth in merchant over time. Should we expect that every quarter of the year? And I guess, kind of behind that, it seems like we're entering a period maybe we'll get into smaller tickets, inflation. Pricing seems to be getting better in the industry. Now all those things contributing -- are all those fair assumptions? And then that 11.5% question. Robert Hau : So from a quarterly flow standpoint, obviously, first quarter closing after going through that merchant conference, we put up a 20% number. So we certainly don't expect 11.5% every year or 11.5% every quarter. Obviously, a great first quarter out of a 5-year projection, lots left to do, in very good shape in terms of executing on the multiple elements of growth that we talked about during that conference. Clover and Carat continued to perform well. We continue to invest in new capabilities there. So I feel like we're off to a great start. Of course, that conference, I think, was in early March. So we're early into the process, but we're in a very good position, and we think we've got a great set of assets in terms of operating systems to bring to both our enterprise and small business clients. We've got a great distribution system, our global reach and geography. Frank talked about in his prepared remarks how well Caixa is going and the strength in Latin America. So I think we're hitting on all cylinders. And we're quite pleased with where we are so far, but plenty more to go. David Koning : Yes. Great, great. And then just one follow-up. The margin cadence through the year, Q1 was a little slower than the guidance. Q2 a little slower, too. Is that fair and then the back half is when you get maybe above the full year guidance? Robert Hau : Yes, that's exactly where we're at. And I believe we said in prepared remarks, we're up 60 basis points for the first quarter. That's right in line with our internal expectations, and obviously, our internal expectations have us achieving the 150 for the full year. And we continue to execute. And it's not really \"a hockey stick.\" It's a matter of the tempo of the business. We did, as you know, a significant amount of integration work in the last couple of years. We ended merger and integration treatment, i.e., we're no longer adding back to our adjusted results for merger and acquisition -- merger and integration spending. And we still have some of those projects going on as we finish up the, what, 2-plus years now since we merged. That will ease in -- over the next couple of quarters, those costs will be reduced, and we'll continue to get good growth and fall-through into the business. So you'll see the 150 come in over the course of the year. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to come back to the payments segment for a second. It sounds like you're seeing some positive signals there. You've got some newer wins coming down the pike. But just so that our expectations are calibrated properly, I know you're talking about the medium-term range of 5% to 8% being good for this year, but should we think about more of the lower half to maybe the midpoint just given that we're starting the year at 5%? I just want to make sure that we've kind of got the right cadence in our thought process because I know the comps get tougher from here on out. Frank Bisignano : Comps do get tougher, but pipeline comes in over time, too. And I think we talked about the elements of it. Obviously, we've talked a whole bunch leading into this year about $120 million of issuer wins, and we're beginning to see them in our numbers. We also feel the assets are very, very strong assets. And you heard us talk about a change in direction on bill pay from where we were a year ago. So we feel -- we don't feel at all that we're at the low end in our range on that in the go forward. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's good to hear, sure. And just a follow-up on the Finxact acquisition. How much revenue do you expect it to contribute to the fintech segment this year? And can you just go a little deeper maybe into the go-to-market strategy there and the kind of synergy that Fiserv is going to bring to this asset? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Well, you won't -- Bob can talk about more, but you won't see anything in this year's numbers. So we change structurally our growth rate. Obviously, these are long cycle sales. But the go-to-market strategy has multi prongs. One is the ability to bring to our clients today a digital sidecar if they want to. If they want to build crypto or digital bank capability, we have the ability to do that. So that expands the TAM of what we can do and I think doing that given the fact that you won't see anything in the economics for this year. But that's one element of it. The second element is the combination of DNA and Finxact together being able to bring an unbelievable offering to a number of clients in a different manner. The third is standing up fintechs and digital banks and other embedded finance. And you hear us talk about our open finance initiative and how well Finxact complements that. And then I think Finxact has a great demonstration of a current base that they've sold into that, in some cases, would be larger than where maybe our lifetime sweet spot was. But you should expect that to be more TAM opportunity. We go to market together in a very concerted fashion. And when the assets on our surrounds all come to it, it becomes a very, very strong offering. I think you'll see that growth in the outer years, not in this year, but you should expect it to be highly accretive to our growth rate over time. Robert Hau : Just to hit the point home on revenue this year. Of course, it would all be inorganic. So it is -- it wouldn't impact our 7% to 9% for the total company or the 4% to 6% for the fintech segment. But overall, very small from an adjusted revenue standpoint also. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Can you guys share your updated view on consumer spending trends? Are you seeing any sign across the business that inflation or higher fuel prices or other macro factors are sort of tipping from tailwind to headwind? Any kind of clues that the robust spending levels that we've seen will prove sustainable? Frank Bisignano : Well, I mean, I would say if you looked at April, it fundamentally looks the same with maybe some places having a little more and some places having a little less. Obviously, areas like petro services and restaurants are holding up at the same level, maybe a little bit on travel and retail. But clearly, we've been conscious of the consumer. And as we think about the future, we factored in what would happen if this slowdown did occur, and that's really -- that's in our prepared remarks. We talked about our prudence and prudent management around the thought process. So very little change right now, but we're very guarded and we're managing in a guarded fashion. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And I also was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the revamped bill pay interface that you mentioned that would be rolling out, I believe, in the summer. What kinds of things can you do with that business to kind of continue the nice inflection that I think you're seeing back in the right direction? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I think it's really about the user experience. It's all about the user experience and about giving them capabilities that were refreshing in that environment. It allows our bank partners to then be able to actually increase their bill pay capability with their clients. So remember, we're always focused. And you hear it in my M&A comments. You hear it in how we run the business, on how we give our clients the opportunity to do more business with their clients. So think about it as a very good, easy, usable front end that actually will be the most modern you can touch, that allow much more ability for that end user to be able to navigate versus what they had before. And our banks and us believe -- that change, as we've completely built it with our banks in mind and their conversation, we believe that it allows them to get more user capability, which will equal more usage and higher engagement by the client base. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to touch on the fintech segment first. Just obviously, the -- and try to get a sense of appetite of banks to spend and continue to upgrade their systems, especially given what looks to be a strong earnings period and potential for them as interest rates change, et cetera. So just what's your feel right now for opportunity sets there? And are you seeing any changes or improvements in appetite? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Having spent a fair amount of time in charge of the spending of banks around these assets and now having been here, what I find is that the appetite is very, very strong. The appetite being strong means if they can get digital capabilities, if they can serve their clients better, if they believe that the change is actually going to help them grow and do a better job, they're completely committed. We've seen a lot of those DNA wins. We've seen it from small to tall, as I would like to say. And the addition of Finxact, in my mind, just has opened a lot of our current banks' eyes and a lot of our nonbanks', that we're not serving in that space, eyes towards the capabilities we can bring to them in the here and now. So I find it to be a tremendously encouraging time for that business. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. And as you think about -- obviously, there's lots of focus always on the merchant business and that kind of thing. But consistent with the Finxact acquisition and when you think about M&A, is there place where you feel like, okay, we need to prioritize if we're going to look at potential acquisitions on merchant versus fintech? Or based on what your -- where you're seeing traction and where you feel like there's opportunity, are you leaning in one direction or another as you're evaluating acquisitions? Frank Bisignano : Well, I think Finxact was a very, very big acquisition which gave us, in my opinion, the most modern platform in the industry that can tremendously scale. So I think that, that was very important and sets us up for the long haul. If you go back to my comments earlier, I think we're very focused on helping our clients grow in places we're not -- weren't or we're not in manner. If you look at BentoBox, it allows us to move to be in the front of the store capability. What that does to ARPU for us in our restaurant business is very, very strong. And so you should expect us to deploy our capital in acquisitions more in the space of how to better serve our clients in markets that we're not collecting revenue, so investing for growth as opposed to back-end synergies and really a digital eye on all of it. Robert Hau : James, the one thing I'd add is, I guess, I don't think about it and I don't think Frank thinks about it as which should we do. I think given the capital we have available to deploy, we think we can do both. In the last 15 months, I think we've done 8 different acquisitions, both focused on digital as well as on our merchant business. Those digital investments benefited our merchant segment, they benefited our fintech segment, and they benefited our payments segment. And ultimately, as Frank pointed out, it's all about how can we better serve our customers so that they can better serve their customers. Operator : And our final question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. James Friedman : This Slide 25 on the annual guide is super helpful. But Bob, I was wondering if there were any call-outs specific to the Q2 of '22. For example, are there any standouts that we should be aware of from the Q2 of '21, like periodic or anything else that we should keep in mind? Robert Hau : No. I guess the thing to think about is within every individual quarter last year, we had ebbs and flows of the pandemic recovery. We had a big stimulus push in Q1 of last year. Not only did we benefit by having more cash into the U.S. consumer, but we actually helped put the cash into the consumer, i.e., we issued the cards. That was a Q1 activity. And then Q2 and Q3, we saw -- and Q4 for that matter, we saw the benefit of the consumer using that cash. But overall, if you look at the Q2 growth rate last year, it's a pretty difficult compare. We did 18% growth, in particular very strong merchant business, but that was off of a recovery of a very difficult Q2 of 2020. So -- and we feel good about the overall growth of the business, and we expect all 3 of our segments to continue to perform well. James Friedman : Any similar comment about the Q2 margin expectation? Robert Hau : Yes. We talked a little bit about this earlier. We get various flows. We actually, I think, said this back in Q4 when we first gave the 150 basis -- at least 150 basis points expansion for the full year. Because of some of the timing of the investments we're making, because of the ramping down of some of the integration work that we're no longer adding back from an adjusted operating margin standpoint, you'll see margins improve in the second half. Obviously, we still improved this quarter; in fact, a little bit better than we expected at 60 basis points. But you'll see us reach that 150 for the full year throughout the year but more expansive, I guess, in the second half. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR department and team with any questions. And have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2022 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Shub Mukherjee : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients yet again won us several accolades in the quarter. Fiserv was named a leader among merchant payment providers for the Carat operating system by Forrester Wave. Fiserv was also awarded the prestigious Webby Award for our Developer studio, a platform, which provides rich and expansive API integrations. Now moving to our second quarter results. We delivered a strong 12% total company organic revenue growth, once again exceeding the 7% to 9% guidance range we provided for the year. The terrific performance on the top line resulted in 14% adjusted EPS growth to $1.56, bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 17%, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range provided for the full year. We attained $180 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $700 million since the merger, exceeding the increased commitment of $600 million 2 years ahead of our original commitment. The impact of high inflation and our continued investment in the business resulted in adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, down 40 basis points from second quarter last year. We continue to see opportunities to innovate for our clients. through our recent acquisitions, such as Ondot, BentoBox and Finxact, as well as organic investments across our portfolio. Additionally, these investments and accelerated revenue growth resulted in higher capital expenditures and working capital, leading to free cash flow of $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. Looking into the remainder of the year, our year-to-date organic revenue growth outperformance of 11% puts us in a very good position to beat our prior organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Given the strength in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook to a range of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% previously. The low end of this revised growth outlook assumes a macro slowdown in the second half versus the first half of the year. With this higher organic revenue outlook and the year-to-date adjusted EPS performance of 17% growth, we are raising the lower end about full year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $6.45 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021. Given the elevated inflation environment, unfavorable foreign exchange and our plans to continue to invest in innovation for our clients. We now expect our full year adjusted margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points. Now turning to the business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems : Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. This operating system approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. We grow and create value in 3 ways : First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the growth of our existing customer base. Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain committed to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. Since we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions in early April, we have been focused on 3 key areas : Integrating our existing digital surrounds into Finxact; selling Finxact to our existing clients as an innovation platform or sidecar core; and winning new logo sales on the Finxact solution. The feedback from both existing and new clients has been very positive. Now let's dive deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We posted very strong organic revenue growth of 17% for the quarter. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 5% in the second quarter, continuing the positive trend since the start of 2021. Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by the strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals, such as travel and petro. Our international regions also had very strong performance on a local currency basis, in part offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Spending across the EMEA region accelerated during the quarter, driven by strength in hospitality, restaurant and retail verticals. Our merchant business in Latin America was very strong in the quarter as we continue to make significant progress in the Argentina market. And in Brazil, onboarding merchants throughout exclusive merchant-acquiring mandate from Caixa. We are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. Spending trends in APAC were strong, driven by a rebound in the economic activity across nearly all markets, as well as new wins and implementations. Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat both continue to gain significant traction with clients. Clover global revenue grew 24% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 27%, as well as growth in software and services penetration to 15%, up over 350 basis points. Clover's vertical-focused strategy continues to deliver in market with BentoBox now fully integrated into Clover for all e-commerce payments. When Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user versus a Clover-only restaurant. In addition, UberEats was launched in the second quarter as another integrated delivery partner for our restaurant merchants. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22%. We saw a broad-based growth across verticals, including petro and quick service restaurants. In the quarter, Carat made several strides in further strengthening its positioning within the petro vertical. Among the notable wins include a contract with Wawa, a large chain of convenience stores and gas stations. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a long-standing client to introduce a customized dealer settlement and reporting platform supporting over 10,000 retail locations in North America. In keeping with Carat's mission to continuously innovate for our clients, Carat launched pay by plate, enabling our petro partners to facilitate transactions based on license plate recognition for customers that opt in, replacing the need for a physical card. Carat continues to capture new payment flows and has made significant progress across digital payouts and EBT online, with transactions growing 69% and 54%, respectively, in the quarter. Further bolstering its capabilities, Carat launched new payout options in the quarter to include digital checks, prepaid cards and crypto wallets. We also had some notable wins within our enterprise business in North America during the quarter. We expanded our partnership with Walmart to facilitate onetime digital payouts to consumers and won a contract with Sodexo, a leading global facilities management company, to digitize consumer and employee payouts. Turning to our international merchant business. We continue to show strong momentum with the following highlights in the second quarter. In EMEA, Fiserv signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, one of the largest banks in the region with over $115 billion in assets and a significant presence across the retail, corporate and SMB space with over 24,000 POS terminals deployed today. Fiserv will be providing it's acquiring as a service suite of solutions, including our automated onboarding solution and omnichannel acceptance platform, with SoftPOS-enabled deployment. The bank will also benefit from Fiserv's enhanced risk, real-time broad management solutions, our merchant portal and reporting capabilities. In APAC, we went live with Sportsbet, the market leader in online sports betting across Australia; and boarded 10,000 submerchants from MYOB, a leading provider of digital business accounting services to small businesses in Australia. Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 14% versus Q2 of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we completed the onboarding of Bread Financial, formerly ADS, the largest of the 3 top 25 credit issuing wins we announced in 2020. Bread was the third of the 3 wins to onboard, completing the $120 million in annual revenue related to new wins we announced at our last investor conference. Looking forward, our current implementation and sales pipeline remains very robust. Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. Our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel, even as debit transaction growth continues to normalize industry-wide following the stimulus-driven high debit volumes last year. Our market-leading digital solutions, including CardHub and SpendTrack, have become key differentiators in our new business pursuits and serve to drive more cards into our debit network, more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk, fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 35% in the quarter. Our 1,000th Zelle client went live during the quarter, a feat we accomplished in under 4 years of commencing Zelle implementations. And we expect this momentum to continue with line of sight into doubling our Zelle client base over the next 2 years. Fiserv recently won a competitive bid to support the state of California's middle-class tax refund program. Fiserv will manage the program and distribute prepaid debit cards to qualified program recipients. This win reinforces our position as a leading provider of government programs, an area of expanding opportunity. We had a notable win in the student loan processing space which will considerably extend our position as a provider of choice to student loan servicers. We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the second quarter, we expanded our relationship with a U.K.-based financial services company, NewDay, to provide processing and other services as they relaunch the John Lewis Partnership card, one of the U.K.'s most popular retail rewards credit cards. Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by strength in our account processing and digital activity as well as the timing benefit of periodic revenue. We had 7 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by our 3-pronged approach. Our proprietary online and digital banking solutions with integrated surround solutions, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, offer a leading modern banking experience for our clients and users. In keeping with our open sourced approach to serving our clients, we are also pre-integrating third-party digital solutions into our cores and making these solutions discoverable to clients their our app marketplace. Last but definitely not least, we are making our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our Developer Studio with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. And Finxact further cements our lead in next-generation banking. Our Finxact product was selected by Colorado-based National Bank Holdings to utilize Finxact's modern core to pursue an SMB-focused digital-only greenfield initiative called 2UniFi as part of their initial modernization effort. As an example of cross-selling Finxact into Fiserv's existing core clients, Massachusetts-based Martha's Vineyard Bank will utilize Finxact's open APIs to deliver innovative new products and services across all channels, including highly personalized experiences for its customers. The combination of Finxact's technology and Fiserv's size and scale, ecosystem of digital surrounds and knowledge of banking, is winning over other competing offers in the market. Together, we are delivering value to our clients by accelerating their modernization journey. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. We had a strong second quarter thanks to our execution across the business and our broad portfolio of products and services. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across all segments. Notably the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 8% to $1.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 10% to $8.1 billion and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 32.7%, consistent with the first half of last year. The adjusted margin was impacted by a combination of factors, including: First, cost inflation for both labor and material, including point-of-sale terminals for our Merchant Acceptance segment and paper and plastic for our Payments segment; second, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; and third, continued reinvestment into the business, including wrapping up of the Fiserv-First Data integration projects. As we previously indicated, these began ramping down late in the second quarter and into the third quarter. This will lead to improved margins as we complete the spending and as the benefits of those projects materialize in the second half of the year, particularly in Q4, leading to a strong exit rate for 2023. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.56 compared to $1.37 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $2.96, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range which we provided for the full year. Free cash flow came in at $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 65% to adjusted net income this quarter and year-to-date. The free cash flow conversion was driven by a combination of : First, increased capital expenditures, particularly in the areas of innovation and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by the very strong revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased inventory to minimize any potential impact to our clients given the risk of supply chain disruption; and fourth, continued investment in software and application development to drive sustainably higher growth across the business. As we look forward, we expect the free cash flow conversion to improve meaningfully to end the year at 90% to 95%, which is slightly below our previous outlook of 95% to 100%. We are focused on serving our clients with innovative solutions and sustainably stepping up our growth rate for the company to high single digits or even better this year from historic levels of mid-single digits. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 17% in the quarter and 18% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 14% and 16% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 7% and 5%, respectively. When excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, which we will fully cycle through in the third quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7% in the quarter, respectively. Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. Clover posted a strong 24% revenue growth for the quarter and 30% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $58 billion or $233 billion on an annualized basis, up 27%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 39% and 44% year-to-date. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 89 year-to-date. Carat, our omnicommerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22% in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 13% to $593 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 31.2%. This was driven by inflation and continued investments in the business for growth. Year-to-date adjusted operating income improved 17% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 29.9%. We expect adjusted margin in the Merchant Acceptance segment to improve in the second half of the year as we see the benefit of lower inflation, continued strength in revenue and productivity. Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, at the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in this segment include active accounts on file in our North American credit processing business; the output solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by an increase in the number of clients and transaction growth. We expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in the full year organic revenue growth rate to come well within our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 5% to $668 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a combination of inflation and investments in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 6% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year at 43.2%. Moving to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 7% in the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth for the first half, at the high end of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. As Frank mentioned, we added 7 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. The combination of Finxact's modern core and Fiserv's leading digital surrounds is winning in the client's office. Adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $281 million and up 7% to $556 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 120 basis points to 35% in the quarter, driven by investments in Finxact, which we acquired early in the quarter; as well as increased organic investments in the business. For the first half, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 30 basis points to 35.2%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $125 million in the quarter and $247 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21% and was 19% for the first half. We continue to expect 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.5 billion on June 30, and debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0x, in line with our target leverage. In June, we increased our bank revolver to $6 billion from $3.5 billion previously and extended the maturity to June 2027. The new revolver provides additional capacity and flexibility. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 5.1 million shares for $500 million. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we have had nearly $400 million of share repurchases so far in July. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit growth in both adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS. In the second quarter, we published our 2021 CSR report, which included a number of key enhancements to add disclosures and respond to new reporting standards on environmental impact and corporate governance. We are proud to share our ESG journey as we continue to optimize the business while generating value to shareholders and communities. In June, we expand our back-to-business program in Nebraska. In addition to a $10,000 grant, businesses receive access to innovative business management technology from Clover, ongoing community support and small business resources. Our program in Nebraska is expected to award $1 million in grants for small diverse businesses. We are incorporating green building design principles as a priority for our offices and facilities. In the second quarter, Fiserv received LEED Gold green building certification for our Downtown Manhattan location. And we are working toward LEED status at the completion of our Berkeley Heights, New Jersey and Dublin, Ireland hubs. Finally, before I turn it over to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to thank Shub for her terrific work as our Head of Investor Relations for the last 18 months. Shub is taking on a new assignment as our Head of Strategy, and I look forward to continuing to work with her. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Chariell, who is with us today, as our new Head of Investor Relations. Welcome, Julie. I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Great results across the board. Robert Hau : Thanks, Dave. David Koning : Yes, I thought one of the most interesting things, volume up 10% in merchant. Yield must be up 7%. I think that's the biggest in maybe ever that we've seen. Is that primarily -- you called out mix of SMBs, but there could be pricing components or just more services to the merchants. Is there any 1 or 2 of those that's more prevalent? And how sustainable is that? Robert Hau : Yes, Dave, thanks. As you heard us say over the last couple of quarters, we don't necessarily -- like to necessarily track yield. And the fact is we're not managing for yield, we're managing for revenue growth and overall margin. There's always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This quarter, last quarter are 2 examples where both yield is positive. As we continue to sell more value-added services, as we see more revenue per merchant, obviously, we see the benefit of yield. And yes, we see that it -- we believe our overall revenue growth is sustainable, and we'll continue to see good growth in the business. Some of that will be \"yield\" because of more value-added services. Some of that will be more transactions. David Koning : Great. And then just as a follow-up, just on margins. I know you called out investments and inflation impacts. But as we look in the back half, I think it has to be up about 200 bps in the back half, 200 bps year-over-year. Is Q3 or Q4 above or below that? Like maybe the cadence just of the 2 quarters remaining. Robert Hau : Yes. I think you should expect the margin to improve into Q3 and more so into Q4. The combination of -- we do anticipate inflation to subside a bit from the very high levels we saw in the first half of the year. Additionally, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks as well as last quarter, we have this carryover work that we have going on from an integration standpoint. Last year, we dialed those costs out. We added them back to adjusted earnings. Beginning in January 1 of this year, we stopped dialing that back out. And therefore, you see those costs hit in Q1. In Q2, they started to ease. In the latter part of Q2, they will continue their easing rate. So those costs go away. In addition, you get the benefit or the productivity out of that integration work. And so you'll see a bigger improvement in fourth quarter than you do in third, and second half stronger than the first half. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : I think I'll start with actually the follow-on question to Dave's question. Same question for you, Bob, on the free cash flow bridge throughout the remainder of the year. Conversion running 65% year-to-date, you're now expecting 90 to 95% for the full year. Can you just help us with what gives you confidence in the improvement in conversion in the second half? Robert Hau : Yes. Lisa, so I think a couple of things there. One, we definitely see the improvement in inventory in the back half of the year. We have been buying significant amounts of inventory, both in terms of point-of-sale devices, but also in paper and plastic for our Payments segment, our output solutions business payments. We see that easing into the second half of the year. That was done not only the case of actual point-of-sale devices, but some components to protect our clients from having hardware available. And we see that easing in the second half of the year so we'll see an improvement there. Overall, I believe working capital will improve into the second half as well as some improvement in CapEx from a timing standpoint. And then, finally, as we see improved margins, a bit more productivity to get more cash flow. Frank Bisignano : Yes, I would just add. We've had tremendous opportunity for greater product build-out, organic opportunities and market opportunities. We didn't look at it -- I now look at Finxact, Bento and Ondot as 3 examples where I think we are very, very pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to have a much larger footprint on those. Finxact would be a perfect example. We're building into industrial strength at a much faster speed. And I think one of the other items I highlight is we have increased our speed of execution. You see in our revenue numbers, it does affect our CapEx number also. But if you look at the speed at which we implement, the size and scope of which we operate, it's been a very, very good, strong trajectory, increased speed and execution. Robert Hau : And Lisa, I think those 2 last elements that Frank pointed out is really at the heart of why we've taken our full year outlook down from the 95% to 100%, now 90% to 95%. Continue to see those opportunities, and we want to work those opportunities. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Okay. Good. And then my second one is more of a strategic question related to Zelle because you had a number of Zelle-related call-outs this quarter : 35% transaction growth, 54% client growth. Can you just remind us how big Zelle is as a contributor to Payments and Networks? Like how we should think about the monetization model of Zelle and its contribution to both, I guess, size and growth of that segment? Robert Hau : Yes. I think overall, it's a relatively small piece. It's, call it, roughly 2% of the Payment segment. We've obviously seen good growth there and is part of the growth driver of the business. And as that continues to ramp, now we have a number of financial institutions, and therefore the number of users, as we see more and more ubiquity of that capability of that tool, i.e., more consumers making more payments, we'll continue to see good growth and so. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Congrats to Shub on the new role. I'm excited for her. On the -- I just want to upfront ask on the visibility side, if you don't mind. Just any interesting trends in July to call out? Are volumes and new sales ramping as expected? And same thing on the cost side. You have better visibility now on the cost to support this better revenue growth. Frank Bisignano : Yes, I'd say first of all, look at July volume. It's getting in line with Q2. The consumer remains resilient, fundamentally in line in volume and transaction standpoint also. So although the month's not over, this month seems to be continuing in the fashion. And visibility on the expense side is very, very clear. We have clear line of sight. Obviously, we made a bunch of decisions to grow this business, probably at a level that is where we like it. And we continue to see that opportunity, but we do see the opportunity to take down expenses on a run rate basis relative to margin, or productivity opportunity to put our productivities in front of us. Probably don't have to -- we know how to get it very [ well ]. Robert Hau : And Tien-Tsin, as I pointed out, and obviously, we expect inflation to subside a bit. We have the productivity of completing those integration projects. Those have been ramping down as of the kind of middle to end of second quarter. You see clear line of sight to see that continuing into Q3. And we see good opportunities to continue to invest, focused on sustainably growing this business much faster than it has in the past, taking our revenue guidance up this year from previously 7% to 9% to now 9% to 11%. And those opportunities that Frank talked about to increase our speed of execution and drive innovation not only is an impact to cash flow, but margin. And therefore, you saw us lower margin a bit even though we took up EPS given stronger growth. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Overall encouraging for sure. Just my quick follow-up, just with your target leverage now. You bought a lot of stock, it sounds like, in July. Curious on the appetite to continue with the buybacks versus doing deals. It seems like there are some payment fintech properties for sale out there. So just curious if there's any change in thinking. Robert Hau : No. I would say no change in thinking. The strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow gives us the opportunity to both buy back shares and look for value-accretive acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. If you look, we did about $1.4 billion through yesterday or so, through July so far. But we also completed a number of acquisitions. And in fact, what, over the last call it, 15, 18 months, 7 different acquisitions for about $2 billion while we're also buying back shares. So we'll continue to do both. As you know, we're in the market regularly. We clearly believe there's real opportunity in the value of our stock, so we'll buy back. But we also look for value-accretive acquisitions. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Could we revisit the revenue growth strength we saw? I mean, really across all 3 segments, but if we hone in on merchant for a minute. Again, I mean, this kind of 17% growth was definitely well above what anyone, anybody expected. And when we look at the sustainability to that, is there something -- anything anomalistic in growth in this segment in the quarter, or for that matter either of the other 2 segments, that wouldn't be sustainable in your mind? And maybe medium term, is this a sign of things to come in terms of elevated growth, first? And then just to revisit again the spread between revenue and volume. You talked about value-added services, I think, and again, SMB. But is that kind of a spread? Really, do you expect revenue to outperform volume consistently now? Frank Bisignano : I'd start on merchant. We purposely had investor conference to talk about how we saw it over the longer haul. And obviously, we do believe in driving up our penetration rate of software services. You saw that go up 350 basis points. at 15%. We talk about moving that over the longer haul to 25%. So ARPU is clearly a focus of ours. Our ability to also continue to expand in markets. You hear us talk about Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, along with our vertical of -- and we feel very, very strong about our capabilities we're going to build out over the long haul in the restaurant vertical and then move into the services verticals. So we feel our partnerships continue to grow. We believe we're the partner of choice in that business. And what you see in there, obviously, we had a couple of points of inflation in there. But what you really see is the strong growth of the investments we've made, the businesses we've bought and integration capability of the total franchise. I mean, I do believe that we get leverage from our bank partners and other partners in a way that only we can. And of course, Clover and Carat are 2 leading products in the industry that we continue to invest heavily. And so I think the sustainability, minus inflation, is right in front of us. And we've been driving this for a long time and I have talked about for a long time, and you're seeing the fruits of the labor. Darrin Peller : Okay. And Bob, just a quick follow-up on the yield again, if you don't mind. Robert Hau : Sure. Yes. So obviously, very positive yield this quarter, was last quarter. There's always variability quarter-to-quarter, and so we try not to get too myopically focused on that calculation within a given quarter. We think it kind of evens out over time. As we continue to provide value-added services, we'll continue to see improvements. We are very focused on adding merchants to our portfolio, i.e., signing up more merchants. We're very focused on selling more products to those merchants. That lifts our PO and drives revenue and margins for the company. Darrin Peller : Okay. Guys, just very quickly, the free cash and margin profile. I mean, the business is obviously growing notably faster. So should we expect maybe a more moderate margin story going forward, or free cash conversion, just to support this kind of growth? Or is it just the anomaly-stic items around inventory build and restructuring, and either way, you should get back to that 95% longer term? Robert Hau : Yes. I'm not ready to update our medium-term or long-term outlook. Obviously, the crystal ball these days is a little bit fuzzy in what '22, '23, '24, '25 is going to look like. Look, at the end of the day, we're focused on driving sustainable growth in our revenue. We're up significantly from where we've been historically. We took up this year -- we said the merchant business, the medium-term outlook was 9% to 12% in our last full investor conference at the end of 2020. In March of this year, we actually took that up and extended it. So we went out to 2025 and said we believe we'll be at 11%. So we're driving for sustainable growth. That obviously helps the top line. It's growing the bottom line. We took our EPS growth up this quarter for the full year and we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive overall value by growing the top line, bottom line and generating great free cash flow. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. And along the lines of it's sort of hard to argue, over the past few years, we haven't seen a lot of profitless, irrational competition. Are you seeing or do you expect to see any improvement in the competitive environment? I guess primarily driven by fintechs who maybe have a harder time raising capital to compete with you with. Frank Bisignano : I mean, the way I think about it is we run a large enterprise. We have competition in every country. We have competition in every business. I think our solutions are world-class and leading. And I think ultimately, this is about how we provide our clients an opportunity to grow their businesses, whether it's a small business, a community bank or large enterprise. So I don't really look at it as anything other than our job is to be the best and provide the best. And from a competition standpoint, there's a lot of great competitors out there, but we feel when you look at our numbers and you look at what's going on, that we're gaining market share. Robert Hau : And Ramsey, maybe the thing I'd add to punctuate is, at the end of the day, we believe profitable, scaled businesses will perform over time. And competition comes and goes. We'll continue to execute, we'll continue to perform for our clients, and we'll continue to win. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. Follow-up for me is, I was wondering if you could give us an update on how mix is trending in your acceptance segment. And I mean that from both an online, off-line as well as credit versus debit? And I guess the broader question is, do you think the mix in your business has sort of stabilized at this point? Or is there still some sort of post-pandemic readjustments that need to occur in order to get back to that stabilized place? Frank Bisignano : I think from a debit, credit, it's stabilized. I think it's been stabilized. Maybe there's a percentage point, 2, delta from when we started pre-pandemic to now in that credit, debit mix. But I think we're at a normalized rate there. And obviously, we keep driving e-comm, we keep driving car, and that trends up. But we do have a very large footprint globally, so those move in small increments relative to the size of our merchant business. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. And online, offline, same story? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Just wanted to start on the revenue side. Obviously, nice to see the upside there and the raise in the outlook. Can you give us just a little more detail on how to think about the segment level outlook for the year? I think I heard you say, for payments that you'd be comfortably within the 5% to 8%. Just a little bit more color across the board there would be great. Robert Hau : Yes, Jason, thank you. If you look at the 3 segments, obviously, we've lifted the full company from 7% to 9% previous outlook to 9% to 11%. So we're above the year -- we're above the midpoint of the -- excuse me, above the medium-term outlook that we've given in the past. In the payment segment, as you pointed out, we said during the prepared remarks that we think it's well within the range of a 5% to 8%. Merchant, we had previously guided or provided an outlook of 9% to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term outlook. At this point, obviously, given we're 18% year-to-date, we're off to a good start in the third quarter with volumes in July continue to be in line. So we expect that to be above the guidance range or above that 9% to 12% outlook. And fintech at 4% to 6%, we're 6% year-to-date. I would expect that to be in the range for the full year basis. There are obviously some ebbs and flows with periodic revenue. But overall, we feel good about the growth rate of all 3 of our segments to be at or better than our previous outlook. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just a follow-up on costs. Can you just comment on your ability to pass some of these inflationary items on the labor material side on to your customers, perhaps with some sort of lag? It seems like that's probably the biggest driver of the 50 basis point reduction in the margin outlook for the year. Robert Hau : Yes. I think -- so it varies by segments and varies by business within that segment. If you think about the overall impact of inflation, Obviously, we've got some revenue growth or revenue growth driven by that inflation, but bigger impact from an expense standpoint. We do see that flowing down for the balance of the year. So both a little bit less benefit on the top line but a little less hit on the expense side. So we'll see some margin improvement into the second half of the year. That is the large driver of that, combined with those investments that we're seeing, are driving the reduced growth in our margin. Still up 100 basis points over the prior -- at least 100 basis points over the prior year, but inflation and those investments are certainly driving some of that. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Thanks for all the color and detail. You mentioned the cloudy crystal ball right now. Can you just Give us a little bit of insight of how you're thinking about kind hof macro assumptions and what you're seeing maybe right now that's influencing those in terms of how you're formulating outlook for the rest of this year? Frank Bisignano : What -- if you go back to how we've guided. Really at the low end, you'd have to think -- you heard the comment I had made that, that assumes some macro slowdown, and that would be 400 basis points deceleration in the second half. Now I just gave in July quarter to -- month-to-date which isn't exactly showing that yet. But that look is a look of really caution relative to going on both in inflation, what's happening in the workforce dynamics, where we see interest rates. Obviously, that's the low end. If you go to the high end of that, it's continuing the way we're continuing right now. We're not looking for anything go much better, We think and we do believe that we have a great opportunity with the M&A coming out, getting the benefit to that, and improved productivity, having put in the merger behind us, where in fact you go back in. So those are really the assumptions inside here from a macro standpoint. Bob, anything you'd like to add? Robert Hau : James, obviously, if you read the Wall Street Journal or pick up any news report with interest rates and inflation and, obviously, a headwind. Unemployment is quite low, that's remarkably resilient. The consumer balance sheet is quite strong. So overall, we feel pretty good about the visibility near term. It's the '23, '25, we're just kicking off our 2023 budgeting cycle. At the end of the day, I think one of the keys to think about is the demonstrated resilience of this company in every cycle. So if we were to hit a recession, which I think some people believe we're technically in right now, how deep does that recession go? How long does it last? What's the overall input? Is it a job-full recession? All of that creates some of that murkiness. But at the end of the day, we have proven to be incredibly resilient throughout those cycles. We've got levers we can pull right now. We are making a decision given the strength of the top line, the ability to invest, and make sure that we are providing continued innovation for our clients. A little bit lower in margin, but actually raising EPS, we think, is the right near term, midterm and long-term decision. But if things were to suddenly go very soft, we've got levers to pull, we'll drive productivity and we'll continue to deliver. James Faucette : Appreciate that. And quickly for you, Bob, just with that rising interest rates are recapturing the impact -- potential impact on your interest cost appropriately? Or is anything that you would call out that we should keep in mind there? Robert Hau : Yes. I think 2 things there. One, we're about 85% fixed debt, 15% variable. The -- look, by far, the biggest chunk of that is commercial paper, and there's a balance of commercial paper both in U.S. dollar and euro. Obviously, that's going up, but that is quite a bit lower than fixed rate debt. So we're in good shape there. And of course, as a company, we have a bit of a natural hedge. We have interest with variable rate debt, but we also have float revenue. So we have cash on the balance sheet that actually generates interest that roughly offsets that variable rate. So overall, rising interest rates, net-net, are actually good for us within reason, given that we're naturally hedged. And higher interest rates are good for our financial institution clients and therefore provide opportunity for us. Operator : And our final question comes from Vasu Govil from KBW. Vasundhara Govil : I think most of my questions were answered. I just wanted to get more color, and Bob, you alluded to it a little bit in the last answer. But just as we think, market's is obviously worried about macro concerns, so maybe you could help remind us how each of your segments would behave in a recession? Where you expect to feel most pressure, where you would see more resiliency. And then also on the margin front, what kind of cost levers you have going into a potential recession. Robert Hau : Yes. I think if you look at the 3 segments kind of in order of what might see impact in a meaningful downturn : Merchant first, followed by payments, followed by fintech. Overall though, we think we proved quite resilient. Obviously, even in 2020, which was a very difficult year by all accounts, we managed to well flat revenue, grow earnings per share double digits, up 12%. And so to the earlier comment I made, we have levers to pull, we have investments, we can mitigate and manage the overall bottom line. This is the 37th year of double-digit earnings, assuming we deliver on our guidance for the year, which obviously we fully expect to do. That's through lots of different cycles, both good and bad. And so we believe broadly that we'll do quite well. If we see a sudden shock, go back to Q2 of 2020, obviously, at the height of pandemic, everybody took a hit, and we sustained quite well overall. So we feel good about our opportunities to weather storms. Vasundhara Govil : Excellent. And just one quick modeling one on FX. Obviously, FX headwinds are trending a little bit worse. Can you update us on what the expectation on that is for the year? Robert Hau : Yes. We've previously had been expecting about 100 basis points headwind on revenue from FX. That's now up to 200 basis points, clearly driven by euro and Lat Am, Latin America, largely Argentine peso conversion. But in general, certainly a headwind that everybody is facing. Frank Bisignano : I'd like to thank everyone for their time, and we look forward to talking to you. Appreciate it. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie. Before I begin, let me again welcome Julie to the team. As we announced last quarter, she moved to a new role as the Head of Strategy. Julie joins us from Bloomberg, where she was a senior equity analyst covering the fintech and payment space and has extensive experience as a sell-side analyst and investment product manager. Welcome to your first Fiserv earnings call, Julie. Turning to the results. Overall, I am very pleased with yet another quarter of double-digit growth in both organic revenue and adjusted EPS. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our client base, depth of our partnerships and resilience of our businesses. Consumers activated more cards, continue to spend and were issued new credit. Merchants opened up new businesses, offered better experiences and took advantage of more value-added services. Financial institutions upgraded their systems and invested in new products to better compete and capture efficiencies. In the early days of the fourth quarter, we are seeing the same trends continue. We grew adjusted revenue 8% with organic revenue up 11%, at the top end of our full year 2022 guidance range. Adjusted operating margin of 35.2% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, expanded 170 basis points sequentially and was consistent with our internal modeling. Adjusted EPS of $1.63 included an $0.08 foreign exchange headwind versus last year, which is $0.03 more than we anticipated 90 days ago. As we look forward, pressure remained from inflation, a still tight [ global ] market and geopolitical uncertainty. But as a global and diverse business, we are well prepared to capitalize in any market environment. Based on continued momentum, strong execution and near-term visibility, we are raising our revenue guidance to the high end of the range for this year to 11% organic and raising our adjusted EPS to $6.48 to $6.55. Clearly, we're executing well beyond our legacy as a mid-single-digit top line grower. Based on the actions we've taken and the investments we've made, I remain confident that we can achieve faster growth in the high single-digit range or better over the coming years while maintaining our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. When we brought together Fiserv and First Data in July 2019, we envisioned an industry-leading combination with a complete set of strong payments and fintech capabilities that were highly complementary. As we've combined these great companies, we're sometimes asked how being a diversified company that serves merchants and financial institutions, large and small, across all payment types is the winning strategy. We believe we're already demonstrating this through market share gains, faster growth and expanding margins, and the third quarter is another proof point of the power of this team and our set of assets and capabilities. Third quarter highlights the continuing momentum in our Payments and Network segment with organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 45.9%. Our issuer solutions business, which includes credit processing for large issuers and card and statement services, was particularly strong. Issuer solutions [indiscernible] contracts, with 3 of the top 25 North American credit card issuers within the last 2 years, a testament to our single platform that delivers a full suite of digital capabilities. We can trace our success here directly to the investment we've made in the business over the last few years. These include a robust set of APIs; AI-based fraud management; cardholder experience technology, being the Ondot acquisition; integrated end-to-end output solutions plus ongoing cloud enablement of our technology stack. Since we began combining Fiserv and First Data, we made a decision to pursue the opportunity in the government vertical with its large TAM and multiple use cases that span merchant, issuer and output services. We began investing in the solutions, people and infrastructure, and the strategy is now playing out. This month, we began issuing roughly 10 million prepaid cards for the State of California under its middle class tax credit program. Since announcing this win last quarter, we were awarded another contract with the California State Controller for cards supporting various disbursement needs. We work with 5 other states to disburse and process their unemployment benefit cards. The pipeline remains large, and this vertical is traditionally quite resilient through the economic cycle. Investing in innovation is a constant across our business, and nowhere are the benefits more evident than in our Merchant Acceptance business. We had another strong quarter for merchant, growing organic revenue 14%, once again outpacing our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. At Clover, we rolled out several new products to enhance the merchant experience and customer authorization. This quarter, we'll be piloting an expanded retail vertical offering with additional horizontal value-added services, including an integration with accounting and business software. Our vertical solutions are resonating. In September, Clover Sport signed an agreement with Caesars Superdome and the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, adding to its base of over 250 professional- and college-level sports venues. Clover will streamline purchasing at concession stands, premium bars and clubs with digital, contactless and self-service purchasing. We will also provide third-party integration to related services and real-time data insights. Carat, our enterprise omnichannel operating system, launched new money flows and continued to lead the market in payout choice and flexibility. We launched more instances of our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. And we're proud to share that in July, Fiserv was named Merchant Acquirer of the Year by the Merchant Payments Ecosystem Awards in recognition of the highly successful debut of Carat as an omnichannel commerce operating system. As I mentioned earlier this year, data is an emerging business for us, and it spans both merchant and financial institution clients. We're excited to announce our new data-as-a-service offering in September, partnering with Snowflake. Fiserv will enable customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. By leveraging Snowflake Secure Data Sharing, customers can now seamlessly and securely access and integrate their data, driving deeper timely insights. A large energy company is just one type of client already in pilot. Financial institutions are excited by our data-as-a-service offering as well. Carter Bank, a $4 billion Mid-Atlantic community bank, is in an open data pilot with us to consolidate and connect all data across the enterprise. Many banks tell us they spend too much time trying to source, provision and integrate data. Fiserv and Snowflake will make it easier for Carter to use the data across their Fiserv and non-Fiserv systems to fully understand their customers down to the branch level. Fintech performance was lower than normal this quarter at 1% organic revenue growth but generated 4% growth year-to-date, and is on track to meet our organic growth guidance of 4% to 6%. This is a consistent business, but timing of product additions, new business implementations and professional services revenue can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Some of this revenue anticipated for September slipped into the fourth quarter, and we have good line of sight to full year revenue in the medium-term guidance range. We remain encouraged by our visibility here after signing 14 core wins in the quarter, with 9 being competitive takeaways spread across large banks, new banks, fintechs, community banks and credit unions. Earlier this year, Webster Bank acquired Fiserv client Sterling Bank to create a $65 billion Northeast regional. In the quarter, Webster chose Fiserv as its core account processing platform with multiple surround spanning our fintech and payments offering. We've talked about the strategic importance of Finxact, a leading cloud banking core today, with 11 clients already in production. After just 6 months under our umbrella, Finxact is attracting strong interest from both new and existing Fiserv clients. With 2 large new client wins in the quarter, Finxact will become the cloud-based core platform for 2 more emerging online banks. And just yesterday, we entered into a new agreement with Zenus to power this global digital bank's first-to-market solution, running Finxact on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Looking forward, there's plenty of uncertainty around what 2023 will bring. We're currently in the planning phase but have already taken steps to ensure we are prepared for a softer macroeconomic environment. We are fortunate to have a well-diversified business with high recurring revenue and a strong balance sheet. Bob will talk more about these factors shortly, but I want to share with you what I am seeing and hearing from clients and where I see opportunity for Fiserv in the coming quarters. The Payments segment has successfully capitalized on industry trends that are enabling strong growth. I call out 4 major trends that are responsible not only for the strong growth we are seeing now but a robust pipeline for the coming year. First, cardholders continue to expect better payment experiences, and more issuers look to our platforms to meet this demand. Issuers are also investing in more modern technology solutions such as better digital, broad and loyalty capabilities, all of which offer us attractive cross-sell opportunities. Second, the addressable market is growing. Segments such as health care, education and government are increasingly looking for new credit processing and disbursement solutions. Nontraditional start-ups and fintechs have also been actively entering the card issuing and lending space. Third, demand for plastic solution remains high as issuers compete heavily for new volume. Finally, the card payments environment has remained active even as we see continued growth in noncard payments, including Zelle and real-time payments. Two regulation-led opportunities [indiscernible] first, the Fed announced that its real-time network, FedNow, would go live in mid-2023. Fiserv has been part of the FedNow pilot, and we believe that we are well positioned to participate in the rising adoption of real-time payments. We enable financial institutions and, eventually, billers and merchants to integrate with a variety of real-time services and networks through our single connection. Second, earlier this month, the Federal Reserve finalized a clarification to Reg II that the dual network requirement for debit applies for all transaction types, including card-not-present. Fiserv believes this will promote market competition, which will ultimately benefit consumers, merchants, issuers and the industry at large. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, support card-not-present transactions, but many factors will influence our ultimate opportunity, so we will wait to see how issuers implement this rule once it takes effect in July. In Merchant Acceptance, the uncertain macro environment has merchants, large and small, looking to optimize the value in their operations. In some cases, this has increased their desire for a single full-service provider over fragmented specialists. And that suits us well given our breadth and scale. Their focus on areas like payment optimization, lower-cost payment methods and fraud is presenting more value-added service opportunities as well. In fact, we've won a few deals to enable Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants, is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. One of our large petro merchants, Sunoco, with 5,500 locations, was just one such win in the third quarter. With the e-commerce penetration returning to a more normal growth trend, card-present solutions are in focus as the more complex problem to solve for integrated omnichannel solutions. Our marquee base of large merchant customers is looking to us here. This includes leading petro and grocery merchants who are more insulated from economic slowdowns due to the nondiscretionary nature of their businesses. In our Fintech business, banks are managing through the macro uncertainty with a focus on serving existing customers and improving operational efficiency, two areas where we provide a number of important products and services that offer a way to grow accounts and enter new markets in a cost-effective manner. Finxact, our new cloud-native modern banking platform, is being recognized as the best way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. And our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. A leading example is our partnership with One Finance, supporting their growth initiatives in retail. We can offer them faster time to market with greater flexibility and scalability plus the largest product portfolio available. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone.  If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter results showed continued strength and the benefit of our broad portfolio. Total company organic revenue growth was 11% in the quarter with continued momentum in Merchant Acceptance, a nice step-up in growth in our Payments and Network segment and stable performance in the Fintech segment, considering the impact of some timing of revenue quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 35.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. As Frank mentioned, margins improved sequentially 170 basis points from the second quarter on 1% higher revenue and 2% lower expenses. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted revenue grew 9% to $12.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $4.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, 40 basis points ahead of the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was impacted by several factors, including, first, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; second, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in September; and third, the net impact of inflation on our revenue, offset by costs for both labor and material. As we've previously said, we expect significant adjusted operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We have 4 factors driving this improvement. First, the benefits of the final ramp-down of prior integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits. Second, in the latter part of the third quarter, we began taking some cost actions to tighten spending in light of the continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe. Third, as part of our ongoing strategic review, we divested our Korea business and 2 small low-margin nonstrategic units. Finally, we anticipate healthy operating leverage and easier inflation comparisons in the fourth quarter. These factors should deliver our full year guidance for at least 100 basis point improvement and sets us up well for 2023. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.63  compared to $1.47 in the prior year. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted adjusted EPS by $0.08 per share year-over-year or 5 points of growth headwind relative to the exchange rates a year ago. Year-to-date through September 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $4.59. Free cash flow came in at $849 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 81% of adjusted net income this quarter, well ahead of prior year and first half levels. Like the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect a significant ramp in free cash flow and free cash flow conversion in the last quarter of the year. Free cash flow conversion of 71% year-to-date reflects a combination of : first, continued organic investment in software and application development to drive higher growth across the business; second, greater working capital investment in both accounts receivable and inventory, driven by accelerated revenue growth; and third, higher capital expenditures associated with the newly acquired capabilities to drive innovation and integration. As we close out the year, the sustained strength in our business gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth outlook to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. With this higher organic revenue growth outlook and execution on cost actions that support continued adjusted operating margin expansion, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to a new range of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021, at the high end of our original 15% to 17% guide. This includes significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which leads to an additional $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the third and fourth quarters relative to our expectations just 90 days ago. While we anticipate greater than 100% conversion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong revenue growth as indicated by another increase in our organic revenue outlook. We have real investment opportunities to sustainably grow our top line faster than market and faster than our history of mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, we now expect full year free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85%. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 14% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 14% for the first 9 months, well ahead of the medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 5%, respectively, excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year. Activity was consistent in North America with some deceleration in Europe. We see new opportunity with the launch of our Deutsche Bank joint venture in the quarter. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. Clover revenue grew 19%, coming off our toughest comparison against last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 21%. Software and services penetration reached 15% of total revenue, an increase of over 260 basis points from last year and up 30 basis points sequentially, with strength in assets like Clover Capital. Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We won key clients away from competition such as SalonUltimate software, a comprehensive solution for salons and spas. Another PayFac win in the quarter was Tempus, which expands our presence in the health care vertical. We focused on our integration of BentoBox and rounded out our restaurant offering with the acquisition of NexTable for reservations, providing an opportunity to expand ARPU beyond the average increase of 2 to 3x, which we see for merchants using BentoBox and Clover. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing at 18%. We continue to drive accelerated growth in new money flows with third quarter digital transactions up 67% year-over-year and online EBT transactions up 27%. We delivered on our new innovations and signed agreements with Sunoco to launch Pay by Bank and with Subway's digital acquiring business in Puerto Rico via our connected commerce ecosystem, among others. We also continue to show we're a provider of choice for fintechs, this time with [ peer lenders there too ] for digital disbursements and card-not-present acquiring. Adjusted operating income in Acceptance segment increased 11% to $610 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 32.4%. The improvement was led by operating leverage and cost management more than offsetting the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as well as FX. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 14% to $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 30.8%. Turning to Slide 6. On the Payments and Network segment, organic revenue grew 11% in the quarter, above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 19% versus third quarter of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as the onboarding of new clients. And our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel. We are pleased with several wins among fintechs in the quarter as well, including one with Papaya for eBill distribution. Papaya is an app provider that brings billers and consumers together for a better bill pay experience. Year-to-date organic revenue grew 8%, and we expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in full year organic revenue growth at or above the top end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $744 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points to 45.9%, driven by strong operating leverage. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points versus last year at 44.1%. Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 1% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 4% year-to-date, within our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The nonrecurring portions of this business, including new product implementation work and professional services, was impacted by the timing of contracts in September. But we retain good line of sight to this revenue being booked in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 9 competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income was down 5% in the quarter to $261 million and up 3% to $817 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 190 basis points to 34.1% in the quarter, driven by investment in Finxact and timing of periodic revenue. Year-to-date, the segment's adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points to 34.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $109 million in the quarter, a slight improvement from the first half run rate and $356 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.9% and was 19.8% year-to-date. We expect the full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on September 30. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turn to 2.9x, reaching our target leverage of being below 3x, which we set when we announced our merger. During the quarter, we stepped up our share repurchases, buying back $750 million worth of our stock. We had 24.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we've repurchased a little more than $250 million so far in October. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. We've included Slide 8 in the presentation to reflect this greater investment while strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. Let me wrap up with an update about progress on ESG and our people platform. Since the release of our most recent CSR report in the second quarter, we have seen positive momentum in our ESG ratings at MSCI, Refinitiv and S&P CSA and significant increases in our ISS quality scores. We have submitted our CDP survey for the second year. These improvements are attributable to our improved ESG programming, framework alignment and our 2021 CSR report. As we look out to what is best described as an uncertain year ahead, Fiserv is well positioned for the long haul. We've made the investments in product, people and infrastructure that will allow us to continue as an industry leader, driving better top line growth and productivity. We've talked about some of the product innovation and TAM expansion that we've achieved. So let me take a minute to discuss our people. We're grateful for our dedicated workforce, especially our essential workers who are present throughout the pandemic. We recognize their commitment both through compensation and career advancement while supporting them by upgrading and expanding our infrastructure. This made it particularly gratifying when we were ranked #6 of the top 250 largest U.S. public companies on the American Opportunity Index earlier this month. The index measures how well these companies foster economic mobility based on real-world outcomes for employees, particularly those without a college degree. This index is one indicator that shows we are well positioned to compete for talent. Our hybrid workforce strategy is greatly enhanced by world-class facilities and colocated workforces. We began consolidating around large modern hubs and closed over 70 facilities in the past 2 years. This morning, we announced our new location for our global headquarters in Downtown Milwaukee. Last month, we opened the largest fintech hub on the East Coast, our innovation center in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where we anticipate LEED Platinum certification. This followed a major upgrade of both our production and office facilities in Omaha, Nebraska. We are opening new and expanded facilities in Dublin, Ireland and Sao Paulo, Brazil and are working towards LEED certification in these facilities after achieving LEED Gold status in New York. While this spending will ease in 2023, we are already reaping the rewards through lower operating expenses and increased productivity. I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hardworking Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : First one, just, Bob, it's for you on free cash flow. Can you just elaborate a bit on what changed, I guess, relative to 90 days ago that caused you to bring down the free cash flow outlook for the year? And maybe just more broadly, looking forward, how are you thinking about what more of a sustainable level of free cash flow conversion is for Fiserv, realizing that there were some unusual items in this year, in 2022? Robert Hau : Yes. Lisa, thank you. So I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the adjustment in our outlook for the full year, I think I would point to a couple of things. One is we continue to see good opportunities to invest for future growth. Obviously, we're seeing an impact in the current year from an 11% growth rate that puts pressure on working capital. As you grow the top line, you have more receivables, but we're also carrying more inventory. One of the things that has persisted longer than we had anticipated just 90 days ago is the supply chain issues/problems in China around getting point-of-sale devices, et cetera. And we continue to ensure that we have availability of product and can support our client base with having a product, point-of-sale product. COVID shutdowns in China are actually going on right now, and so protecting ourselves there. We also have some new geographies and new clients that are bringing on Clover and other point-of-sale devices. So we continue to invest in that. You see our capital spending around new product development, software cap. We continue to see good opportunities, so we're driving for sustainable, very high single, perhaps even low double-digit growth investments around the acquisitions of Finxact, Ondot, BentoBox. We've made the decision to keep investing and therefore revised our free cash flow. In terms of long-term sustainability, I'm not prepared to give guidance for 2023. But we've certainly seen in the last 2 years, '21 and '22, a pretty significant step function change in our growth rate, 11% last year, which granted is against the COVID adjusted prior year. But 11% this year, bending that curve, so to speak, from companies that were mid-single digits and perhaps generously mid-single digits pre merger, now double digits. You're going to see something less than 100% free cash flow going forward, I think. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Okay. Okay. All right. And then my follow-up, Frank, for you. In your prepared remarks commenting in regards to Carat, you highlighted that many merchants find that the in-store, the card-present component of acquiring or omnichannel acquiring is often the more complicated part. Can you just elaborate on this? I think this is a question we get often just sort of related to how to think about omnichannel acquiring and the tricky aspects of executing that for merchants that might currently use different acquirers in-store and online. Frank Bisignano : Yes. Thanks. I think we always had a very strong in-store presence. And we were always a large processor for e-commerce transactions. And then we geared into the front end of the business and began building out that omnichannel presence. What we see is that our ability to bring, in fact, a single integration point, single reporting structure, connected hardware, connected systems as companies evolve and want many times an easier instance, we are an excellent provider of it. And when we look at Carat long term, you see us also talking about other features in there where we allow a multi-purse wallet that puts more product in there. It could be loyalty. It could be prepaid. It could be rebates. So how we bring all that capability in a single connection, ultimately even allowing larger players. And ultimately, we think it will drop to mid-market, this capability, the ability for their consumers to build greater loyalty through this single connection and this omnichannel presence. So we're pretty excited. We've built it out. The use cases are there. We feel the winning is occurring and the volume is falling through the system. So it's been strategic. We came from a different place than others. We came with a great physical presence and a great processing capability. And then building omnichannel front end of Carat is resonating well with our clients. So think about it along with integrated value-added services and embedded finance, and all of that ultimately was using a much larger value prop, that pure omnichannel. I hope that's helpful. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Bob, could you dig into your commentary around the bridge to 2022 margins, particularly your actions to tighten spending in the third quarter? Can you bracket for us what the annualized cost savings from these actions might be? Robert Hau : Sure, David. So a couple of things from a margin standpoint. If you recall, actually going back to our first quarter earnings call, which we reiterated in the second earning -- second quarter earnings. And we've expected since the beginning of the year that our margin would accelerate into the second half of the year. That acceleration was largely driven by carryover integration spending that we used to back in 2021, just out as merger and integration spending. Our company policy says you do that through the end of last year. And any projects that are continuing no longer get adjusted out of our earnings, and so we had some cost flow into the P&L at the beginning of the year that we knew those projects were going to finish up in the first half, first 9 months of the year. And so that investment, that integration spending would taper off through the year and, in particular, be mostly out by the end of the third quarter. So you see improvement in investment or lower spending on those projects. Plus you get the benefit of the projects being done, i.e., those generate a return, generate productivity. And so you get a double bang in the second half of the year. And in particular, as those projects again have largely been completed at the end of the third quarter, we'll see that come down in Q4 and get the productivity. The second piece of growth in margin is basic productivity, i.e., nonmerger-related nonintegration, what we used to refer to as operational excellence rolling through the business. Some of that is very basic productivity Six Sigma leaning out your spending sort of a thing. Some of it is the fact that we've now reopened our offices, and our associate base is returning to the office, increasing our collaboration. Frank talked about the location work that we've done in creating large hubs like the Berkeley Heights facility in North Central New Jersey that is now open, driving some collaboration and productivity. And then the -- I guess, the final 2 things that will drive margin in the fourth quarter, one is scale. As you know, an incremental dollar of revenue in this company comes through at higher than company average growth given the fixed cost nature of the company. And so we feel good about seeing good operating leverage on revenue growth and scale. And then finally, some of the divestitures, we did those 3 small units that we sold. At the end of the third quarter, you'll see the benefit of fourth. Q3 over Q2, we expanded margins 170 basis points. Obviously, if you do the math, we've got a big expansion expected in the fourth quarter. But quite frankly, if you look over the last 5 or 6 quarters, right in line with what we've done in the past, 300, 400, even 500 basis point margin improvement in a number of quarters in the last 6, 8 quarters. So I feel good about our ability to generate at least 100 basis points for the full year. David Togut : Just a quick follow-up on the Clover revenue growth, which stepped down a little bit to 19% but still well above market growth. What's the path to get back on the 5-year growth plan of 27% that you laid out at the March Merchant Acceptance deep dive? Robert Hau : Sure, David. I guess the fastest thing to think about or the largest thing to think about is the 19% number that we showed in our prepared remarks and in the slides. That's a reported number. Obviously, FX had a pretty significant impact in the entire company, actually in all companies in the third quarter. If you were to currency adjust that number, you'll probably pick up 3 points, maybe even 4 points of growth. Plus, as you recall, in the first quarter of this year, we divested a small joint venture that we had. It was a minority equity interest actually technically, generated about $175 million of cash. So on an organic basis, that Clover growth is actually more in line with the 25% that we've talked about as part of our long-range expectation of growing Clover to at least $3.5 billion. Frank Bisignano : Yes, I would add there. We talked about $3.5 billion in 2025. We talked about a 9% to 12% for the segment. We're in normal compares, we're at 14% right now for the segment. I also think what we're doing on value-added services and they don't keep inching up and moving up and just saw it's a key driver here. We continue to grow the merchant base, grow the LTV , growth the ARPU, and we feel highly confident in exactly what we said in March. And I think it's playing out right now exactly as planned. Our sequential growth has been very high and I think so. If you look at it ex what Bob talked about and just look at the business case and the driving of it, our confidence level is as high as it was in March, and we're seeing it play out, and the value-added services will continue to grow quarter-by-quarter. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : If we break down the merchant growth rate again, 14% is obviously somewhat industry-leading growth. And you had the volume growth, I think it was 10%. If you could just remind us, are the components all the same as to what's really driving that outperformance on overall growth? And the spread between revenue and volume, if that's something that you see sustainable and what's driving that? Obviously, Clover and Carat continue to do well. But how is international? How is the SMB versus enterprise? And Frank, just any patterns you're seeing change, if any, in the consumer behavior would be great. Frank Bisignano : Yes. We like to say, hey, we don't really talk about yields, we are talking about revenue. I know you've heard us be consistently beating that drumbeat. We decided to beat that drumbeat when we're on the right side of that curve. So I think we used it as they walk away from commitment on anything. I think the investment you see us putting into this business, and net investments from sales to infrastructure to product development is really driving the number. I think you heard us announce partnerships across the board and even more today than as we talk more about Deutsche. But then the ISV is -- I think the business mix which we said at the start of the pandemic that we had this tremendously balanced mix, we had the best distribution in the industry and we had fabulous geographic reach, is still playing out. And that really is what's driving our growth number and our volume numbers. We did not have a great quarter in the European theater. But the mix of our business and the strength of our business from the largest retailers to the pizza store in Brooklyn, as you know, I like to talk about my own town, really shows through in the model. I think the work in Clover and the building of the value-added services is definitely also playing into our growth in a way that may not always be just in that but also in our total product set and the ability to deliver it. So I think we do have the industry-leading franchise. I think Clover, they've always been supportive of it from the start, has proved out its merit and you're seeing it come through. I'd say the only other thing I'd add is our franchises in Brazil, in Argentina continue to win and grow as does our U.S. franchise. So value-added services, omnichannel growth in verticals like restaurants, international, that was our story in the beginning of the pandemic, and that's our story coming out of it. And we're having a margin discussion, and we're fully confident where we're going to be there. I would note that merchant has the largest margin it's ever had this quarter also, and that's a testimony to how leadership in that business is driving it and the outcomes it's getting. Darrin Peller : Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the Payments segment. Just the strong, strong growth, obviously, the accounts and the issuer side was strong in the credit card and the new wins. But if you could just comment on what's happening in some of the other aspects of the business, whether it's bill payments or it's the network. Just -- and what kind of aspects of that growth is sustainable versus maybe once we anniversary the new wins, is there more to go? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean we had talked about this. The wins, the onboarding of the wins, they're growing. I'd like to frequently go back to Investor Day where we talked about this incredible pipeline, which at the time felt like it was a once in a lifetime event, meaning you win 3 of the top 25 issuers. And that part was a onetime event. But that pipeline is the same size and shape as it was back in 2020. And the building out of health care and government verticals, investment in education, all bode very well for performing at the higher end of that guidance range as we go forward here. I'm not giving guidance for anything other than what we're talking about in '22. But the pipeline is very strong. And you hear us talking about the California win. But the reality is we've had multiple government wins with our ability to distribute payments in a card-based fashion and having probably the best capability in the industry around that. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : And a couple of things. I guess my first question, kind of a follow-up on David Togut's question. It looks like your sequential EBIT dollars of growth, the way you're guiding is $150 million plus. Your revenue is about $50 million, give or take. So let's say that all goes to EBIT, that's $100 million of extra, right, of extra kind of that cost control. Is that a fair way to think about it? And you kind of said that's sustainable. I mean is that $400 million of run rate cost savings? Because I mean that would be a huge benefit into next year as well. Are we looking at that right? Robert Hau : Yes. David, I'd be a little careful. I have to run through all of your math. You've got some broad assumptions on the sequential growth or the growth year-over-year in fourth quarter. Ultimately, the simple or straight answer is, look, we see some good cost improvement third quarter to fourth quarter. As I talked about earlier, the ramp-down of these integration projects as well as the benefit of the projects driving productivity into the organization now that we've got integration largely behind us, maintaining the productivity model that you've seen from this company for a lot of years. And certainly, incremental revenue drops to the bottom line. The growth in Payments certainly helps. Obviously, that's our highest-margin business, and continuing to see good growth in SMB also helps. So we feel good about the quote, to use a 4-letter word mix, in the fourth quarter. We see good opportunity or a good line of sight towards cost reduction/productivity, divesting a couple of these small nonstrategic units that are low margin and getting that scale really helps into the fourth quarter. David Koning : Got you. And just a quick follow-up. In the Fintech segment, I know Q3 was clearly weak. Is there a way to give kind of a more normalized growth number ex the implementations? And then also, Q4 has been higher than Q2. Every year going back since, I think, '08 was maybe the last time Q4 was below Q2. Is it fair just to think that if everything is kind of normalized that, that pattern would continue? Robert Hau : No. Obviously, we put up a 7% Q2 number. I would not anticipate us being north of 7% in fourth quarter. We do feel good about the growth of the Fintech segment. If you look over the last several years, there's variation quarter-to-quarter. Some of that is the periodic revenue or license and term fees. We have the additional impact in third quarter of this year for these nonrecurring one-timer type. I hate to use to as one-timer because they're regular. As contracts renew, we get short-term or immediate-term revenue, and some of that's already slipped into fourth quarter, i.e., we started to see some of that rebounds. We feel good about, number one, we're already in the 4% to 6% range, and we'll close the year out that way. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I'll just say I thought you had asked about our new Milwaukee headquarters. David Koning : Yes, nice. Yes, great. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Good revenue here. I just wanted to ask on the buybacks here.  You're at your target leverage, as you've called out, and you stepped up your buybacks. It looks like, what, 80% of free cash flow is getting allocated to buybacks year-to-date. So just wanted to check your appetite on buying back stock here. It sounds like October was in line with the third quarter run rate. Appetite to buy back stock versus acquisitions? Robert Hau : Tien-Tsin, I guess, first, yes, obviously, we've been buying back shares. We are always in the market. Every once in a while there's some ebbs and flows, and we've been -- we were strong in the third quarter and certainly strong so far in fourth quarter. I feel good about our ability to continue to buy back shares. It's a balanced capital deployment approach that we've always had and continue to have around investing in organic growth. If you look at that new slide, we added a significant increase in CapEx, which is obviously putting pressure on free cash flow. But we did that while also paying down some debt or delevering down to our targeted leverage rate that gives us lots of flexibility to ultimately do both M&A and share purchase. I see it obviously, as a bit of a trade-off. If I spend $1 in M&A, I don't have that dollar available on -- for share repurchase. But we have good capacity to do both. We look at acquisitions through the lens of a share repurchase. We're certainly interested in continuing to add to our portfolio. As I've said in the past, I don't wake up in the morning saying, \"Geez, I really need to go get x capability given the breadth of our existing portfolio.\" There are lots of things that we can add, whether it's NexTable that we did recently or it's BentoBox or Finxact. We did all of that while also buying back a lot of shares. Frank Bisignano : Yes. No, I think I'd just say that we have an appetite. You see our appetite across the segments. We are highly selective, Bento, Finxact. And then we come back and invest heavily, Ondot, in those as we had done on Clover. So we feel good about our balanced approach. I think you can see that, obviously, we invest in the business organically or invest in the business inorganically. And then we feel good about buying back of stock and returning that to shareholders too. You should imagine that we're going to have that continued balance mentality. And obviously, we like to integrate companies and grow them. Tien- Tsin Huang : Good. My quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Just on the -- you mentioned STAR and Accel supporting card-not-present transactions. I know I've asked about this in the past, and I hear you that you want to wait for how issuers want to implement the new rule in July. But the readiness for STAR and Accel, is there still a lot of investment required to attack that? And I guess, I'll ask how aggressive will Fiserv be in that pursuit. Frank Bisignano : I'd say readiness is high. I think we made a comment that they are designed to be dual network capable. And our ability to execute, we think, is very high. Obviously, we always felt that this would create more competition, and we like that. Obviously, we weren't competing for those transactions before. And you should expect us to behave like we do in every other business line, which is try to grow at the best possible rate. So I think we're in the planning stage. Obviously, it is up to issuers. But we think that this was a very good outcome, and we continue to expect ourselves to participate as we would given our size and scale and the nature of the business we have. Operator : Our last question will come from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Just wanted to go back to Bob, your answer to Lisa's question in the Q&A. The free cash flow conversion, I think you said likely to remain below 100% going forward. But I'm just trying to think about this in the context of the Analyst Day in 2020. I think the target there was 105% plus, and that was with a 7% to 9% revenue growth rate. So just wanted to kind of calibrate this. I mean if revenue growth moves back to the high single-digit range from the current low double-digit run rate, does that mean that free cash flow conversion goes back north of 100%? Or have some other things changed in the business around CapEx or other factors that we should just be thinking about? Robert Hau : Yes. One, I'll have to go back and check the transcript. I don't think I said it was likely. I said to see a business growing at this level. I try not to give guidance or an outlook or adjust what we've said previously. Obviously, in today's world, the view of 2023, '24, '25, '26 is just a little bit cloudy, and we'll continue to evaluate. Some of it is what are our investment opportunities to either be at the top end of that range and/or perhaps even accelerate from that. When we gave -- when we did our earnings, looks to me our investment call, investor conference back in December of '20, we hadn't yet closed the Finxact transaction. We've talked about how that acquisition may give us an opportunity to bend the curve, so to speak, yet again on the Fintech segment, which today hitting at a 4% to 6% rate is above what we've been able to do traditionally. And as Finxact continues to grow, we'll see some opportunity there. Building out Clover and growing our merchant business at perhaps even the high end of that 9% to 12%, the March of '22 investor conference talked about perhaps better growth in that segment. So lots of opportunities for us, and we're going to make sure that we are making good investment decisions to grow the top and bottom line and generating good returns for our shareholders. Jason Kupferberg : And just a quick follow-up. Just given all the momentum in the Payments segment, do you feel more bullish on your ability to be near the higher end of the 5% to 8% target range there, not just for this year but beyond this year? Robert Hau : Look, I think we've seen some very nice progress in the growth this year. We're getting some great feedback from our clients. The $120 million worth of wins that we talked about back in December of '20 now all implemented and growing, many of them actually outperforming that $120 million worth of ACV. We have a continued strong backlog. Building out that government vertical that we've talked about, certainly an opportunity. Again, we're not prepared to give an outlook or guidance for 2023, but we feel quite good about how that segment is performing right now. Frank Bisignano : Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks a lot, guys and girls, ladies. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me today on the call are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter and full year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss the strong ending to a pivotal year at Fiserv. 2022 marked a year of great progress for us with better-than-expected growth against the challenging backdrop. The integration of First Data and Fiserv wrapped up in the first half, and we are entering 2023 with a focus on growth and operational excellence to drive quality and productivity to the next level. We laid out a plan for our merchant segment that includes extending Clover's leadership and are on pace to achieve our 2025 objectives. We won awards for our new enterprise omnichannel solution, Carat, and continue to roll out this unified commerce platform with a leading number of value-added services. In payments, we completed the 3 major credit issuer implementations and followed them up with 2 major new wins in the fourth quarter. And we advanced our core banking cloud road map for new and existing clients with the acquisition and integration of Finxact. Through all of that, we navigated the return to office and are seeing a boost in productivity as our employees come back together, many in new state of the art facilities. We head into 2023 as a unified company that's better than the sum of its parts. One with faster growth and deeper investment that still holds a tradition of strong operating leverage, high recurring revenue and value-accretive capital allocation. Our progress over the last 2 years is undeniable after consecutive years of 11% organic revenue growth, 370 basis points of total adjusted operating margin improvement, and over $5 billion in share repurchases. We delivered on our guidance with a steep ramp in the fourth quarter with 12% organic revenue growth, 360 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91. This led to 2022 results within the guidance range, which we raised twice last year despite unexpected FX headwinds. For the year, organic revenue growth was 11%; adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 35.1%; and adjusted EPS was $6.49, up 16%. Free cash flow conversion was 84% as we continued to invest for growth. Each of our operating segments recorded strong performance, led by Merchant Acceptance with organic revenue growth of 16% and 17% in the quarter and year, respectively. Our Clover and Carat operating systems are driving segment growth well above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer products, such as Data as a Service, pay by bank, disbursements and EBT online, widen the value proposition to clients and bolster our strong positioning in card and non-card payments.  Expanded ISV and direct sales channels extend outreach to merchants and help us capture more of the value in each transaction. Payments and Network revenue had a superb year of growth, up 10% organically in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, above our medium-term guidance range. Performance was led by implementations of 3 top-25 credit issuing customers and continued growth with existing customers. We followed this up with 2 major new credit wins in the fourth quarter with Target, one of the largest retailers in the world; and with Desjardins, the largest credit union consortium in Canada and the fourth-largest card issuer. We are very excited to bring 1 of the world's largest retailers onto our platform, and we're pleased to expand our geographic reach in Canada with Desjardins. It is another example of a major in-house card issuer partnering with us to achieve industry-leading capability. And it's our first connection with a major Canadian issuer, giving us important scale in a key market. We've already begun working with both clients and anticipate revenue starting in 2024. In Fintech, we delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, rebounding from third quarter as expected. For the full year, we generated 5% of organic growth, at the midpoint of our medium-term guidance. Core wins were robust over the last several quarters and continue to go live, adding to an already strong recurring revenue base in this segment. Interest in Finxact is exceeding our expectations, and we're excited to extend our leadership in cloud core banking by going live with digital bank, [ Chello ]. We continue to believe we have the most clients in production in the cloud. We are carrying this positive momentum forward into 2023. This year, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, adjusted operating margin expansion above 125 basis points and adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40, which assumes a mild recession in the U.S. Our guidance reflects internal confidence in the face of external uncertainty. This confidence is built on the strength of our unparalleled client base, our industry-leading distribution, a broad and growing product portfolio and our best-in-class management team. We have the revenue base, the profit-driven cash flow and sturdy balance sheet that should sustain us through a tougher economy. It's times like these that make it good to be an industry leader that continues to invest in new and innovative products. Nowhere was this strong positioning more evident then in the many noteworthy contract extension and product additions signed with existing clients in the fourth quarter. These wins are a reflection of 4 factors : First, our list of clients is vast, high-quality and full of opportunity, and our relationships with them are deep; second, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions supporting both growth and operating efficiency for our clients; third, our client-first relationship model is off to a strong start; and fourth, our vision for the cross-sell opportunity between Fiserv and First Data offerings has become reality. The promise of the merger is being realized. Synergies are apparent. For example, between acquiring and core banking, core banking and embedded finance, and card issuing services across multiple verticals. In Merchant Acceptance, for example, we expanded our global relationship with ExxonMobil. This energy giant will move to the Carat platform to support its retail fuel stations in the U.S. and Canada with gateway, acquiring and fraud security services. We also renewed Carat's contract with one of the largest beauty retailers in the U.S. and added network tokens to their e-commerce system to help increase authorizations, reduce cost and limit fraud. And a major restaurant operator will extend our Merchant Acquiring and prepaid business to more of its brands. In the Payments and Network segment, in addition to the significant Target and Desjardins wins, we expanded our existing relationship with the State of California. After a successful rollout of the Middle Class Tax Refund program in the fourth quarter, we were awarded another prepaid mandate supporting California's unemployment and related insurance programs. This, along with disbursement support for the comptroller's office announced in October, represents longer-term recurring work for the state and marks our leadership in payments for the government vertical. We also signed a large e-commerce payments company for debit network services. This client will enable our STAR and Accel networks for its millions of merchants as an alternative to the larger debit networks. And in Fintech, as a proof point of our deep relationships, ability to cross-sell products and seize synergy from our merger, we continue to add solutions for Webster Bank since its merger with Sterling National Bank earlier this year. In addition to the account processing win we announced in the third quarter, we've now added the Optus platform and ATM services to the growing list of solutions we provide. Similarly, Bethpage Federal Credit Union has also added several of our payments products to its existing core banking platform. In keeping with the emerging trend of core modernization, Innovation Credit Union of Canada will be the latest client to move from a licensed solution of DNA to a hosted version in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. This is one of a couple of dozen DNA customers migrating to the cloud for more flexibility and resilience in their infrastructure. It highlights the modern architecture of DNA, Fiserv's experience in the cloud and further migration from license to ASP revenue. Outside the U.S., we made important progress in EMEA, adding Absa Bank in Mauritius as a client of our Internet gateway. This will allow Absa clients to tap into the fast-growing e-commerce segment in Africa and grow with key corporate clients that are active in this well-known tourist destination. It also opens the door for us to enter 8 other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa where Absa operates today. In Latin America, we extended a large bank acquiring relationship to include several more countries. And in APAC, we signed India's Tata Motors for loan processing and attained a major payment institution license in Singapore. This will allow us to expand beyond merchant acquiring into domestic and cross-border money transfer services, a market that has $180 billion of payment flow. A key to our new and following wins is the significant investment we have made to bring new product to market, increase our value to existing customers, open the door to new customers and grow our TAM. Let me recap just a few of our innovation and advancements this year, starting with merchant. In the SMB space, we serve small businesses wherever they want to conduct business through cloud-based operating systems like Clover, through our channel partners, including ISVs, banks and ISOs; and on platforms that act as payment facilitators, or PayFac. At Clover, we integrated the BentoBox acquisition into the Clover platform to add more e-commerce and digital capability to our offerings in the restaurant vertical. Catering services and hotel restaurants are emerging subverticals for us now, and we know that when Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user. We also rolled out lower-cost hardware and partnered with major providers of retail technology to offer web and point-of-sale inventory solutions to this large SMB vertical. We've begun migrating merchants from our existing Internet gateway to a new Clover gateway where they can more easily access our full suite of value-added services. This positions Clover to compete more for card-not-present business this year from a position of strength. Value-added services penetration, an important driver of Clover growth and ARPU, reached 16% in the quarter from 13% a year earlier. One example is Clover Capital, a product we continue to invest in, is growing rapidly and favorably impacting customer attrition in the SMB segment. In the ISV channel, we've added 174 ISV partners this year and continue to benefit from the high growth and lower customer acquisition costs of this go-to-market approach. Since our acquisition of NetPay, we continue to build PayFac, marketplace and software platform solutions, including real-time boarding, underwriting and split pay services. In the quarter, Fiserv continued to expand and deepen our platform integrations with partners that include PayPal, offering our customers more flexibility in their service offerings. We look forward to exploring other integrations with current and future partners while expanding our capabilities across this market. Carat, our leading enterprise omnichannel solution, continues to expand its capabilities, including payout choice and flexibility. With the introduction of several products this year, including digital checks; prepaid cards and crypto wallets; followed by our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. We continue to onboard large merchants for Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants and is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. And we have seen a strong early uptake in our new Data as a Service offering, partnering with Snowflake. It enables our merchant customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. We also have a growing number of financial institutions lined up to pilot our Open Data solution offered in partnership with Snowflake. Open Data enables near real-time access to data across customers, accounts and activities, bringing relevant insights to support strategic decisions. In Payments and Network, our strong growth in issuer solutions can be traced directly to the investments we've made in our operating platform, Optus. This includes a robust set of APIs, AI-based fraud management, cardholder experience technology via the Ondot acquisition, integrated output solutions, plus ongoing cloud enablement of key features. We have multiple payment innovations underway to take advantage of emerging trends, such as real-time payments. The clearinghouse RTP network, Zelle and FedNow, all work differently than legacy networks, creating demand for an end-to-end solutions provider. We are leveraging the Fiserv NOW network to be just that this year. In Fintech, we've been taking an open-source approach to serving our clients. We've pre-integrated third-party digital solutions into many of our cores and made these solutions discoverable to clients via our app marketplace. We've also made our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our developer studio. Building on its Webby Award last year, this product won a DEVIES award from DeveloperWeek in January for best innovation and financial services. With these advancements, we are driving Fiserv to become the destination of choice for embedded finance, integrating card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking capabilities for a variety of nontraditional providers, including retailers, QSRs, payback and government entities. Another highlight of 2022 was the Finxact acquisition, our new cloud-native banking solution, which we've been integrating with our existing digital surrounds, selling to our existing clients as an innovation platform, or a sidecar core, and winning new logo sales. Our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. Finxact offers them faster time to market, greater flexibility and scalability and the largest product portfolio available, making it an ideal way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. With all of this new product development and the client wins that validate it, I hope you'll see why we remain enthusiastic for 2023. So let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum in all 3 business segments. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in Merchant Acceptance, further growth in our Payments and Network segment and a rebound in the Fintech segment as previewed on our last earnings call. For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, in line with the higher guidance we provided 90 days ago. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.4 billion and adjusted operating income grew 20% to $1.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 39.2%, an increase of 360 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 400 basis points. As we anticipated, 4 factors drove this margin improvement : First, the final ramp-down of integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits; second, operating leverage on increased revenue and improved inflation comparisons; third, actions taken late in the third quarter and in fourth quarter to tighten spending in light of the uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe; and finally, the divesture of our Korea business and 2 small, low-margin nonstrategic units. As expected, the fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 35.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.91 compared to $1.57 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% and to $6.49. Volume, productivity and operating performance more than offset the foreign exchange headwind of $0.25 for the full year. This was much higher than the $0.11 assumed in our guidance at the start of the year. Free cash flow came in at $1.4 billion for the quarter and $3.5 billion for the full year. Free cash flow conversion was a strong 115% of adjusted net income for this quarter. For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 84%, roughly in line with our expectations for approximately 85%, with a slight increase in accounts receivable on some slower collections. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 16% in the quarter and 17% for the full year, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. This is well ahead of the 11.5% annual growth rate needed to achieve our Merchant Acceptance segment revenue outlook of $10 billion by 2025, as laid out in our March 2022 investor call. As we've said, we grow and create value in 3 ways : First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems, our Clover active merchant count grew 9% in 2022; second, expanding our merchant relationships, the adoption of more value-added software and services, Clover VAS penetration reached 16% in the quarter, up 13% from last year; and third, by growing with our existing customer base, our average revenue per Clover merchant expanded 12% in 2022. In the quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 6% and 3%, respectively. For the year, they grew 10% and 6%, excluding the loss of a processing client in mid-2021. Volume in local currency was up 8% for the quarter and 12% for the year, excluding the client loss. This is in line with our typical spread relative to the card networks. Factors that drove faster revenue growth include value-added services, new payment flows and value-based pricing. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to post robust growth, and we're on track for $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025 as presented at our Merchant Investor Call this past March. Clover revenue grew 23% in the fourth quarter on payment volume growth of 16%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. We posted above-average growth in Clover Capital, Clover Software and Marketplace SaaS. Clover Connect for ISVs continues to post very strong revenue growth and added 48 ISV partners in the quarter, totaling 174 for the full year. Carat, our Enterprise omnichannel solution, also had a strong quarter, with revenue growing at 15%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 18% on important new client wins and enhancements for existing clients. This includes our new client experience portals, which improve service and access to data while positioning us to sell more products, from data as a service to fraud services to emerging flows. In 2023, we will complete the build-out of our single orchestration layer known as Commerce Hub, which will allow our clients to more seamlessly integrate with the breadth and depth of our products and services and enhance our e-commerce capabilities. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 22% to $648 million in the quarter, with margin up 350 basis points to 34.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 16% to $2.3 billion and margin grew 100 basis points to 31.8%. The improvement in both periods was led by operating leverage and productivity. We completed the acquisition of Merchant One in late December, folding in this long-term Fiserv customer. This should enhance our direct merchant acquisition capabilities, extend the reach of our Clover product line and create cost synergies. We also acquired Yacare late in the quarter, expanding our capabilities in Argentina by enabling us to bring our QR code payment acceptance to our merchants there. We stand to rapidly become a significant QR code provider as we get this technology into customers' hands. Looking into 2023. In January, overall volume growth was stronger than volume growth in December. This is partly attributable to an easier year-over-year comparison but also indicates the ongoing strength of the consumer and the Fiserv brand. Turning to Slide 7. On the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 10% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 17%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. The California Middle Class Tax Refund program was also an important contributor to revenue during the quarter. While the revenue was mostly onetime in nature, we've signed 2 additional contracts with the state that will bring in recurring revenue in 2023 and beyond. Full year organic revenue growth of 9% was above the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $811 million, and margin was up 230 basis points to 48.5%, driven by strong operating leverage. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 10% to $2.8 billion and margin expanded 120 basis points to 45.3%. Moving to Slide 8. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 8% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, right in the middle of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The rebound in nonrecurring revenue portions of this business : License, professional services and termination fees, was a meaningful contributor to growth in the fourth quarter, as we expected after those revenues slowed in the third quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 8 competitive takeaways. Over the last 3 years, we have 155 core wins and a healthy backlog of implementations that offer solid visibility to revenue for 2023. Adjusted operating income was up 18% in the quarter to $340 million and up 7% to $1.2 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 400 basis points to 41.3% in the quarter, helped by higher periodic revenue and productivity. Full year margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5%. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $88 million in the quarter, slightly improved from the first half run rate, and $444 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.3% and was 19.6% for the full year, in line with our expectations. We expect 2023's adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turns to 2.8x, within our target leverage of being below 3x in the second half of the year. We have approximately 19% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of our stock, bringing our total 2022 share repurchase to $2.5 billion and $5 billion over the last 24 months. We had 17 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue into 2023, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As we look through the mixed indicators on the 2023 economy, we are taking a measured approach to our outlook and assume a mild consumer spending recession, lower inflation and higher interest rates. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, in line with our medium-term guidance, with adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 125 basis points. This translates into adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12% to 14% growth over 2022 and would represent our 38th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This strong operating performance in a weaker economic environment reflects our continued investment in growth opportunities at a time when others may be cutting back. We are redirecting our free cash flow guidance toward dollars instead of conversion since this aligns more directly with how we run our business. We estimate approximately $3.8 billion of free cash flow for 2023. In the past 2 years, we increased our level of investment in growth initiatives, and it led to back-to-back years of accelerated 11% organic revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity to do the same this year to invest in our growth platforms and continue to grow faster than our markets. We retain our focus on long-term free cash flow as a driver of long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. In the quarter, Fiserv provided Back2Business grants to 13 veteran and military spouse business owners through our partnerships in Atlanta. We also launched Back2Business in New Jersey, committing $1 million to small local minority-owned businesses. For the year, we awarded 241 such grants in total. The CDP published our GHG emissions results for 2021. They improved from the prior year in part because of the COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the future direction of our program since receiving LEED Gold status for our 1 Broadway space, awaiting LEED Platinum status for our new technology innovation center in Berkeley Heights, and pursuing LEED Gold for offices in Milwaukee and Dublin, Ireland. Overall, I am excited about what the next 5 years can bring for Fiserv. We are off to a great start in 2023, having just been recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune Magazine for the 12th time in 15 years. I'm especially proud about our 2 most admired attributes, innovation and financial soundness, 2 particularly important qualities in the current environment. We delivered beyond expectations in the past year, and that was not by chance. It was the result of specific actions and thoughtful investment. The groundwork is laid for more strong performance to come. Leading products, bigger TAM, expanding geographies, better service and streamlined modern technology are in our grasp. The years I've spent at highly successful businesses have taught me that our reach must exceed our grasp. There is always room for improvement, so my leadership team and I are focused on driving greater productivity and better processes this year in the quest for operational excellence. I'm confident in our more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world. You come prepared to meet our high bar every day, and I thank you for all you do. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Solid results here. One question. I'll ask Frank, if you don't mind. You spent some time talking about how Fiserv is better than the sum of the parts with the cross-selling and the synergies, et cetera. Has your thinking on synergy contribution to growth changed at all in the last year or 2? Any way to size that in terms of contribution to growth maybe for fiscal '23 or the midterm outlook in general? Frank Bisignano : Well, I think if you look at this year's growth rate, obviously, at 11%, we can feel the power of the franchise coming together, right? And obviously, I like to step back on that question a little bit, too. Remember, we announced a merger, made the top 10 mergers of the year in 2019, and then we had a pandemic. And that definitely did not accelerate our ability to see clients, sell, get in front of them on offerings. We managed through it, we used all the tools available. But I think today, when you look through the company, the opportunities are larger than we thought. Remember, we said we're going to stop really talking about the synergy number. We put a bow on it, we closed out M&I and then continue to still working. But I think embedded in what you see in our growth rate and what we believe the promise was, it's much larger. And I think it will continue. It's just natural cross-sell now, but it's bringing -- we love talking about merchant acquiring and core banking, of the math at all those banks. We like to think about the opportunities, that we've got it by taking out larger capabilities across the company. And delivering more product to the government vertical, you see the things that we're doing that neither company did before, but the 2 together did. And I'd say I simply always think that this is a completely different company fundamentally in its fourth year. A new company where we took the 2 growth rates and exceeded either one, and we'll do that for the rest of our life, with the exception of a pandemic. So I think it's bigger than we ever thought. And I think you'll continue to see it, and it's definitely had an effect, and you see effect in the difference in the growth rate. So we see it in the 2 combined companies, and then from what we originally announced, and how it shows up in today's numbers. So thanks for asking that. It really does matter a lot. It's really we are getting the benefits of what we told you all we'd do, and it's better than we thought. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from SVB MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Frank, another one for you as well. I was hoping to follow up on the growth in Payments and Networks, and specifically the 17% growth in North America credit account growth. I think this is several quarters in a row now you guys have highlighted mid-teens growth there, and then you highlighted 2 additional wins. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what is going on in the credit issuer processing space? Like you guys have a ton of momentum here right now. So kind of what's changed and what's driving that really strong momentum? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I think as you've watched the evolution over time, I start with we love operating systems, we love our platform systems. And the investments that we made in Optus through the cycle really has benefited us in the client's office. And I think it's the full enterprise capability that we bring. I think it's a single platform that we bring. It's the modernization of the platform that we did over the past few years. And I think we came and talked to you at 2020 Investor Day about the 3 large wins that were in the top 25. And then we continued to add. If you remember, I've said to many, I believe, that we did think those 3 top wins were a very, very, very onetime unique situation. But we came back and said, over the past year, we won as much as 3. And then we followed on with these 2 wins that we're pretty darn proud of, in the rank of Target and Desjardins. These are long-term big decisions for these issuers, long-term relationships. And I think the team has done an unbelievable job building out the platform, building out the capabilities all the way from loyalty to user interfaces. And so I think the fruits of this labor continue to come through, and that will be a ramp like the last one. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Great job. And I guess my question, within the Acceptance segment, the gap between revenue growth and volume growth was pretty massive. It was 10%, which might be the biggest we've ever seen potentially. Is that the mix of SMBs? Like you're actually seeing SMBs really good? Is it just more products sold to Clover? You talked about that. Is it pricing? Maybe talk a little bit about that. And then is that sustainable through 2023? Robert Hau : Yes, Dave, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. The answer to your question is yes, it was those items. Obviously, we're continuing to see great growth in the business. We've talked about the key drivers of growth, getting more merchants, selling more to merchants, the value-added sales. You saw our penetration rate go up in Clover. We continue to build out our direct sales channel, the integration of Bento into the Clover solution significantly increases the ARPU. And then we saw some benefit of value-based pricing. So kind of across the board doing very well. And that's both in the SMB as well as in the enterprise markets for us. Am I going to suggest we'll continue that 10% every quarter going forward? No, I wouldn't lay that out. But we see tremendous opportunity for continued growth. We can call you back to our March investor call that we had on the merchant business. We think this is a $10 billion business in 2025. And 2022, the first year on that journey, was right on track. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Can you comment on growth in different geographies? I know Europe had seen some weakness previously. Where are you seeing the more robust growth across the globe versus some weakness? Robert Hau : Yes, Ramsey, definitely seeing some very nice growth across our 3 international regions. They are, for all practical purposes, almost double, maybe a little bit better than double our U.S. growth rate. Continue to see tremendous contribution. The fastest-growing region for us is certainly LatAm with good growth in Brazil and Argentina, particularly in the merchant space, but also seeing some nice traction and our credit issuing capability across the regions. We talked about expanding our reach with a large bank, growing our reach in a number of countries in Latin America this past quarter. Seeing good growth in APAC. Both of those obviously smaller than our footprint in EMEA. But even in EMEA, we're seeing good growth, particularly in the issuer space. So all 3 regions contributing to the growth. And in total, our international business growing almost double the rate of our domestic U.S. business. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Since distribution is one of your major advantages and super important to the Clover growth algorithm, you mentioned some of the various channels you have, the bank channel, direct sales, ISVs, ISOs. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the mix in terms of where most of the new gross adds are coming from. And as a very brief follow-up, if you could give us an update on the U.S. versus international mix for Clover. Robert Hau : Yes, Tim, I think the simplest way to tee that up is we're seeing actually growth across those channels. There are some ebbs and flows as you go quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. But broadly, we continue to sign more banks and get more merchants through that bank channel. We continue to build out our direct sales force. ISO is obviously -- our partner channel is obviously quite significant. ISV, our Clover Connect solution for our ISV partners, is still adding ISVs in a meaningful way. We talked about some of those numbers in our prepared remarks. So the benefit for us is the broad distribution channel isn't that one is growing faster than the other and they're offsetting each other, it's that we just have a broad reach and we can grow across the board. And overall, Clover continues to grow. You heard us quote the 25% growth in 2022, nicely on our path to our $3.5 billion-plus goal for 2025. And international is certainly part of that. In 2023, we'll continue to get some nice growth there, in particular with the Deutsche Bank joint venture now live and beginning to provide some growth for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Nice job this quarter. I just want to look at the -- Frank, when you look at the strategy for the merchant growth to continue, and you see how strong some of the assets like Clover and card have been, maybe talk to us about the next couple of years, of your view of what could drive that growth to continue at what seems to be above-industry levels. And it looks like -- you mentioned services and value added, but it looks like pricing probably played a part as well in the merchant revenue growth rate. Is that continuing? Last one is just for Bob on the segment growth rates. What are you guys thinking about for the year ahead in terms of merchant, or really all 3 segments, embedded in the guide? Frank Bisignano : Let me take the first part. First of all, on all the indicators that we talked about in March relative to our merchant business, we see that as visibly as we saw it back in March, the opportunity. I do think this is about an operating system, it's about platforms. And with that software capability that we bring, obviously, value-added services, changes our growth rate. As I said on this call, I think that we've made a big point of getting off of yield. And as I hope you could see we did get off of it because we were going in a different direction. We just think that, ultimately, we're going to bring more product in, and the mix of our business is different. I think when you take a look at this business, when you're running it the way we do, when you're bringing more stickiness, more clients, limiting attrition through those value-added services, you also have pricing opportunity. And we definitely have value-based pricing that is not having any effect on our attrition rate because we're really delivering multiple products into the clients. That's why we think a lot about ARPU and LTV around these. So it will be continuing to invest in value-added services. We love distribution partners. We love them. We love direct sales. And our distribution partners, I think we have the largest sales force of agents out there. I think our retail ISO business, you remember, when we say ISO in that dimension, I'm really talking about retail ISO way more than wholesale, which we really highlighted more in the processing space. So our vision to invest in software, continue to drive software sales, continue to grow distribution, continue to grow our own direct distribution. And obviously, drive to $10 billion, which is clearly in sight, and the other indicators we talked about. Robert Hau : And Darrin, in terms of the 2023 outlook by segment. You heard the full year, we expect to be kind of in the 7% to 9% range. Our baseline does assume a mild consumer recession which obviously will impact our Merchant segment more than our payments and Fintech, that tend to be more high recurring revenue. I would say that our merchant business will probably be at the top end, maybe above the top end of our 9% to 12% medium-term guidance. In our Fintech space, we did 5% in 2022. I'd expect that to continue to be in our range of 4% to 6% that we provided for medium-term guidance. And in the payment space, which was 9% in '22, actually above our guidance range, I think we'll be at the top half of our medium-term range, of the 5% to 8%, as we exit 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Congrats on the solid results here. Frank, I just want to ask you about the mild recession that you're expecting. Are you seeing any signs of that today? Or are you just kind of reading the tea leaves? And maybe you can talk about the timing of the potential recession as you see it. Frank Bisignano : Well, first of all, I'm not calling for a mild recession. That's in our baseline, right? I just thought I'd be very clear on that. And I mean, there are plenty of people, including Bob, that would say statistically, we already have seen a recession given the contraction in GDP we saw last year. But I would treat it like we built that into our baseline. And to the extent that doesn't happen, we have expectations on the high end at minimum is how I would think about that. I mean, I think we're not right now feeling that element. So it was not a forecast of a recession as much as a planning baseline to consider all scenarios. Robert Hau : And Bryan, I'd add, obviously, it's, what, February 7. January came in well, good. There is certainly some benefit of comparisons. January last year, we were actually coming back out of COVID in a couple of spots, and so it's a little bit easier. That will moderate a bit as we go through February and March. But things seem to be generally holding. And if you listen to the talking heads on TV or read Wall Street Journal or FT or whatever, there's more folks now talking about maybe not a recession. We think kind of the baseline is a slowing of the GDP. And that's obviously, U.S. -- 84% of our revenue is U.S.-based. Obviously, Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, are seeing a tougher economic environment. Who knows what happens with China. And for us, China directly isn't an issue, but the implications, particularly in APAC. So we think it's appropriate prudence to have that baked in. And it's tough to know whether we'll have a mild recession, let alone when. But right now, things are holding. Operator : And for our final question, comes from Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : With fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 12%, well above your midterm guidance and annual guide for next year of 7% to 9%, how should we think through the cadence of organic revenue growth and margin expansion? Thinking through the higher supply chain and wage inflation you had in the first 2 to 3 quarters of last year, combined with any callouts on periodic revenue comparisons? Robert Hau : Yes, Dave. Important element. I think that the easiest way to think about this, or maybe the most straightforward way to think about that, is to look at some of the ebbs and flows that we had in 2022. Obviously, fourth quarter margin came in quite strong. Inflation eased as we ended the second half of the year, so it's a different comparison point. Margins will expand better in the first half, first 90 -- or excuse me, first 9 months of '23 than they did in '22 because of that timing. Certainly, from a periodic revenue standpoint or a nonrecurring revenue standpoint, Q3 of '23 will be against a much easier compare, which was 1% in Q3 of 2022 that jumped to 8%. So you'll see variations like that. I don't necessarily see anything in '23's results that's going to drive great variation, so it's more against the comparisons, of course, other than broad economy and that manageable timing of when a recession might actually hit. But given that, it is expected to be mild, you're not going to see shocks like we did in 2020 in second quarter when the world just shut down. Knock on wood. Operator : And that was our final question. Frank Bisignano : Well, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Feel -- please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team with any questions. And have a great day, and thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes the call for today. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. Fiserv is off to a strong start in 2023 with first quarter adjusted revenue growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58, up 13%. Adjusted operating margin of 33.6% was up 160 basis points. Organic revenue growth was 13%, above our 7% to 9% outlook for the full year, demonstrating our ability to sustain accelerated growth. Importantly, the growth was multidimensional. It included elevated contributions from card processing, noncard payments and digital banking solutions. Growth was also strong in all 3 of our international regions and in Merchant Acceptance. Investment on behalf of our clients and with our partners is paying off. We believe that accelerating our investment over the last 3 years, both organic and via M&A, has extended our leadership position among fintechs. This counters the narrative over the last few years that many start-ups in the payments and fintech space would disrupt and potentially replace the legacy companies. Our results show that our strategy to innovate and disrupt on behalf of, not in place of, our long-standing bank and merchant customers was on the mark. These competitors have indeed raised the bar for the tech and fintech, but we've met and, in some cases, exceeded that bar with our own investment and innovation. The power of our business model is in the virtuous cycle of generating revenue growth across a scaled business, leading to greater operating margins. That profit produces significant cash to reinvest in the business for faster organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions while the remainder is returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The market has shown that legacy companies across many industries with scale and willingness to innovate will offer sustainable value to clients and shareholders. Let's talk for a moment about how the benefits of our breadth, scale and investment have driven innovation. For small- and medium-sized businesses, we developed a cloud-based SaaS operating system for their payment needs with Clover. Now we're allowing these businesses to easily accept multiple payment types and we are seamlessly integrating software and services to address their broader business needs. For large enterprise businesses, we developed an integrated omnichannel system called Carat to manage payment needs across in-store and online sales channels, and we're adding SaaS-based solutions that improve our clients' efficiency and enhance their customers' experiences. For debit and credit issuers we've already built the most comprehensive suite of solutions, and we continue to innovate. CardHub was built off of the tools acquired with Ondot and now offers a comprehensive set of modern digital cardholder experiences. More than 1,000 financial institutions are now using CardHub, which can be fully integrated into their mobile banking app, allowing these issuers to offer their customers a unified digital card experience that only a few of the largest financial institutions can provide today. SpendTrack does for a bank's small- and medium-sized business clients what CardHub does for its retail customers. This differentiated mobile-first platform covers card management and AI-enabled expense management with workflows specific to their business needs. Built from our SpendLabs acquisition, SpendTrack has helped us win more credit, debit and network business with banks and issuers that cater to SMBs. For small- and medium-sized banks, we provide a full suite of the digital banking tools that help them compete with the largest banks from mobile apps, to spend management, to Zelle B2B payments. And in July, with the launch of FedNow will help them participate in the new wave of real-time payments, optimized on our NOW Network that connects banks to each other, to all payment rails and to essential applications. For banks of all sizes, we've built a path to the cloud through both our industry-leading DNA core platform, and now at Finxact, our native cloud solution acquired last year. And in support of our biggest investment of all, the combination of First Data and Fiserv, we are finding new opportunities across our client base that are aligned in ways that only Fiserv can enable. Here are just 3 examples of the power of our combined franchise. First, STAR and Accel, the third largest debit network in the country, helps card issuers and merchants realize attractive economics on debit transaction routing and satisfy new Reg II requirements for at least 2 unaffiliated networks on each card to route card-not-present transactions. Second, our Finxact cloud-native banking core is laying the groundwork as an operating system at scale for financial institutions and merchants looking to offer embedded finance. Third, our Output Solutions business offers a full range of capabilities beyond what either a predecessor company had. For example, we are now able to offer communications and card manufacturing solutions to our entire client base from retail private label issuers to general purpose credit issuers, health care providers, banks and governments. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we start with a firm foundation of above-plan revenue and earnings. Still, we think it is wise to balance this strong start with the potential for macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of the year. So we are lifting the lower end of our prior 2023 guidance for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS and maintaining the upper end at this point. We now anticipate organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.40. Let's discuss the trends we are seeing in each of our segments now and for the rest of the year. Merchant Acceptance continues to be a very strong grower, posting 18% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, including significant strength in Latin America and Asia and continued gains in North America. This growth reflects overall consumer spending resilience but is also a testament to our strong distribution channels, ability to develop new products and services that resonate, success in selling more solutions to our existing merchants and the power of diversification across verticals, merchant size and geography. It's not yet clear whether broader macro headwinds are beginning to impact consumer spending, but we did see payment volume growth slow a bit late in the quarter. We continue to see good demand in the grocery vertical as well as in restaurants, especially QSRs. We've started to see consumers rotate towards nondiscretionary spending and reduced basket size. The decline in inflation is impacting volume growth, particularly in the petro vertical. This did not impact Fiserv revenue, which were large petro providers and other enterprise clients is based on transactions, not dollar volume. Our important advantages in this environment are our breadth of distribution, businesses both large and small, and a good mix of nondiscretionary spending, about half of our volume. Still, we are mindful that higher interest rates may weigh on consumers. And thus, we anticipate second quarter revenue growth in this segment to ease from the very strong first quarter levels. This, of course, is contemplated in our guidance. Clover revenue growth remains strong, up 22% in the quarter. We continue to add merchants at a healthy pace and extended value-added services penetration another point to 17%. Now 1 year since our Merchant Investor Day, we are on track to achieve the targets we set for 2025, $10 billion in Merchant Acceptance revenue; $3.5 billion in Clover revenue; and Clover value-added services penetration of 25%, where [ Clover ] a consistent average rate of growth over this time period was not in our calculus. Instead, the growth rate should accelerate over the next 3 years as we add more products, increase software penetration, and reach new markets. In the first quarter, for instance, we integrated bill pay and enhanced fraud management into Clover and improved access to Clover Capital via our client dashboard. In the past 12 months, we introduced upgraded Clover Mini and Clover Flex hardware. Later this year, we'll add a low-cost smart POS PIN pad to address the needs of smaller merchants who want simpler access to the Clover operating system and software. During the quarter, Fiserv launched support for Apple Tap to Pay on iPhone for SMBs on the Clover platform and for U.S. enterprise clients. This will enable businesses from large enterprises through medium and small businesses down to micro merchants, to securely accept contactless payments on iPhones without the need for additional hardware like an external card reader. As contactless payment usage rises, we are excited to enable new and existing clients to use this seamless and secure solution on iPhone to help run and grow their businesses. On our Carat platform, we continue to expand our capabilities in broad omnichannel solutions for enterprise merchants. We renewed and expanded our contract scope with several large merchants this quarter, including Fanatics and a major hotel chain. We also recently signed a Pay by Bank agreement with Walmart that includes traditional ACH processing and incorporates Fiserv's NOW Network and real-time payments capabilities. Our Payments and Network segment also had a very strong quarter, posting 13% organic revenue growth that included double-digit gains in all 3 business lines, issuer solutions primarily representing credit card issuing and output services. [ Card services ], including debit processing and our debit networks STAR and Accel, and our digital payment services, including Zelle and our bill pay business. This strong performance drove growth that was above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 8% and includes a couple of points of growth from a few discrete factors, which Bob will cover in more detail later. Positive trends continue and should carry full year growth towards the high end of the range. Several years of large card issuer wins in North America will drive revenue growth in the coming years with the pipeline that includes new win opportunities as well as follow-on sales to existing clients as we extend our value proposition. Our issuer clients have been active in deploying 3 highly innovative products : Advance Defense, our new AI-based fraud solution; new card controls and alerts developed by Ondot; and point-of-sale loan solutions that help issuers compete with BNPL providers. Recently, Citi signed on for our POS loan product and PNC went live. [ USAA ] is in the process of implementing Advance Defense, while [ One ] has signed on as well. International Issuer Solutions was another bright spot in the quarter with wins across all 3 of our regions. In Latin America, a leading Argentine fintech Uala chose Fiserv to provide credit card processing services for its new digital-first credit card product launch. It's already live in Mexico and will go live at Argentina and Colombia in the coming months. Uala shows our FirstVision platform for its local presence and global cloud API gateway that maximizes the digital user experience with APIs for instant card issuing, dynamic verification and installment payments among other services. We're excited about additional opportunities as we roll out the next-generation cloud-based FirstVision platform later this year. And in EMEA, we signed a contract with National Bank of Kuwait, the country's largest bank, to process their debit acquiring business on our FirstVision platform. This follows a fourth quarter win with this client for prepaid processing. Turning to [ bank ] services, our debit network and processing business. Growth remains strong as we continue to add new issuing business with our core and noncore bank clients and sign merchants for debit transaction routing via our networks. The adoption of Reg II has brought another large merchant, Uber, to our networks. We will provide Uber the benefit of the added choice that comes from the dual network mandate for card-not-present debit routing. We see many more merchants in our debit networks pipeline ahead of the new rules set to take effect July 1. Our digital payments activity continues to grow with Zelle implementations and transactions. We have over 1,200 financial institutions live on Zelle today, with the potential to add hundreds more to our installed base this year. Financial institutions that use us for Zelle services are connected to the Fiserv NOW Network, which also provides easy access to FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payment system. We have 6 banks in the pilot phase and over 20 financial institutions committed to go live post FedNow launch in July. We're encouraged by the opportunity to add many more banks and credit unions, especially since we think our NOW Network as a single integration layer, offers the ideal way to access FedNow. NOW is a network of networks connecting financial institutions, billers, consumers and businesses with real-time money and data movement across all rails, including card, ACH, Zelle, FedNow and the clearinghouse. In Asia, we are working with leading banks across the region on digital transformation initiatives. This includes Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in Thailand, that will expand its mobility digital banking platform into new domains, and BDO, the largest bank in the Philippines, where we are bringing signature core banking micro services to enhance BDO's third-party systems integration. We're also working with National Payments Corporation of India to enable the unified payments interface on RuPay and credit cards for issuers on our India processing hub. Turning to our FinTech segment. Organic revenue growth of 3% was slightly below our medium-term guide of 4% to 6%, which we attribute to timing and a strong first quarter last year, creating a higher comparison point. Implementations from the healthy series of wins over the past few years will provide growth in the second half of this year. We continue to see organic growth in this segment within the guidance range. Importantly, we have not seen an extended disruption from the banking turmoil that arose in March. Thus far, there are no follow-on effects across our banking client base as we continue to monitor it with our enterprise risk framework. We see the opportunity to sell our regulatory suite to banks who may increasingly need them. And we are well positioned to be a net winner among acquirer banks, should M&A activity heat up. Many larger banks already use a variety of our services, and we've demonstrated the ability to scale our modern platforms. In April, we marked the 1-year anniversary of the Finxact acquisition and have been very happy with its progress. We've seen strong interest from new and existing clients, which has contributed to meaningful growth in our Fintech pipeline. Importantly, in the first quarter Fiserv renewed the Finxact partnership with One, a leading banking fintech backed by Walmart. Finxact will be the system of record for a growing number of One's expanding banking services. Ramping this opportunity will represent a high profile achievement and scale that could attract other banks and merchants to the proven Finxact solution. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. First quarter results largely outpaced both internal and external expectations. Total company organic revenue growth was 13% in the quarter with strong performance in the Payments and Network segment and continued momentum in our Merchant Acceptance segment. Growth is tracking well ahead of initial guidance for the full year, so we are raising the lower end and now anticipate growth of 8% to 9%, which considers economist forecasts for slower consumer spending and bank lending in the second half of this year. We note, however, that we are not seeing signs that these measures are slowing meaningfully at this time. First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 15% to $1.4 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, an increase of 160 basis points. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.58 compared to $1.40 in the prior year. Free cash flow came in at $861 million for the quarter, up 43%, driven by improved working capital. We remain confident in achieving our outlook of $3.8 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on higher organic revenue growth, coupled with our focus on operational excellence, which supports our margin expansion outlook of more than 125 basis points, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range from the previous $7.25 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.40, representing growth of 12% to 14% over 2022. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 18% in the quarter, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 12%. Merchant volume and transactions each grew 5%. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. Clover revenue grew 22%, coming off one of our toughest comparisons with last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 17%. Software and services penetration reached 17% of total Clover revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from a year ago and up 80 basis points sequentially with continued strength in services such as Clover Capital. Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We also delivered new client wins following product introductions last quarter for the payment facilitator or PayFac market. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 16%. International merchant operations represented 22% of segment revenue in the first quarter and grew 39% organically, led by Latin America. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $562 million and adjusted operating margin was up 210 basis points to 30.5%. The improvement reflects strong operating leverage and cost management. Turning to Slide 6 on the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 13% in the quarter and adjusted revenue growth was 11%. Organic growth was well above the high end of the 5% to 8% guidance range. As Frank mentioned, a few discrete items contributed a couple of points of growth. These included additional revenue carryover from state government stimulus work, above-average digital bank transfers in March and a slightly easier comparison against first quarter of last year. Even as year-over-year comparisons get tougher in the second half, we still expect 2023 growth to be at the high end of the segment's guidance range for the full year. The remaining growth was driven by a variety of impacts across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 12%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business continues to grow above segment average driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. And our debit business continues to post solid growth, supported by new solutions and new client wins across processing and network. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 15% to $717 million and adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points to 43.8%. Operating leverage and a favorable mix shift towards debit network revenue helped drive the margin improvement, along with cost management. Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 3% organic growth for the quarter, just below our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. We expect to achieve growth within that guidance range this year as implementation work on prior wins is completed in the second half. Meanwhile, new customer momentum continues and we had 12 core wins in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 2% to $280 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was flat at 35.4% as we continue to invest in Finxact. We expect margin expansion to resume as we anniversary the Finxact acquisition in the second quarter. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million, in line with the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $22.4 billion on March 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased [ 0.1 of a turn ] to 2.9x and remains in our target range of less than 3x leverage. During the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of 5- and 10-year senior notes to replace notes coming due later this year and reduce our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 14% of total. During the quarter, we significantly stepped up our share repurchases, buying back nearly $1.5 billion worth of stock. After receiving Board approval to repurchase up to an additional 75 million shares, we had 78.7 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. Before wrapping up, I want to discuss our ESG efforts. Our approach to corporate, social, responsibility and ESG is one of the ways our business produces better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. Let me share some highlights of our soon-to-be published annual CSR report. First, our ongoing dedication to the progress of our associates through professional development. In 2022, we filled 45% of exempt roles with internal Fiserv associates. Second, our continued investment in minority, women, veteran, ethnically diverse, LGBTQ+ and disability-owned businesses through our back-to-business program in the U.S. and U.K. We have awarded more than 1,600 grants to eligible merchants since the inception of the program. Third, our commitment to continue to improve our collection and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and energy data. Not only have we aligned our 2022 CSR report with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures framework, but we have also provided 3 areas of data and a foundation for measuring the impact of our ongoing GHG and energy initiatives. These factors are reflected and being named to Forbes List of America's Best Large Employers, which is based on a poll of employee recommendations released in the first quarter. We are equally proud of another recognition received in the first quarter as one of America's Most Innovative Companies by Fortune. I started off this discussion by highlighting the importance of the investment in innovation, and this is another proof point on just how seriously we take technology innovation on behalf of customers and our future. This time of year is often marked by the release of ranking figures tabulated for the prior year. And my time in banking left me with an affinity for league tables that I know you also share. I'm pleased to report that Fiserv has retained its #1 position in 8 categories : core account processing; merchant acquiring; mobile banking; online banking; issuer processing; bill payment; person-to-person payments; and account transfers. And that brings me back to where we started our discussion today. The importance of scale in sustaining investment and driving innovation. I thank the 41,000 employees of Fiserv who helped get and keep us here. I know that I speak for all of them when I say, we intend to maintain the privileged position we hold. And now operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just wanted to maybe ask you to elaborate a little bit more on the month-to-month trends, including April. I heard some of the commentary on consumer spend and gas. But also curious around bank IT spending. I know you lifted the lower end of your outlook. Sounds like you feel confident in the timing of implementations on deals. So if you could just maybe elaborate on that and a little bit more on the consumer side, that would be great. Frank Bisignano : I'd say as much turmoil as we had in March, volumes were very high. You hear us talk about what I call a backlog, meaning our books told that being implemented right now, we expect that to be very strong, [ wouldn't ] in the second half. Demand, still very high from financial institutions. I've spent a lot of time with our client base. And the demand for digital, you heard us talk about the demand for Finxact, also our clients are building bigger businesses than trying to gain share also. So we feel good about the bank IT spend. And we feel good about our position with our client base right now. Hope that answers your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just my follow-up then, if you don't mind just -- I know you've called out the Uber win on the STAR and Accel networks for CNP routing. We've been -- I think, I've asked you a few times, Frank, on Reg II. So you mentioned a strong pipeline. You see a burst in potential deals and revenue leading up to that? Or is this going to trickle into the second half of the year? Just trying to understand the... Frank Bisignano : I think it's second half and beyond. I think it's probably more a '24 than a '23. We should see some of it in '23, but I think you'll see more of it in '24. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about the spread between merchant volume and revenues, which widened a little bit this quarter. If you could just update us on the primary drivers of that spread, product mix, geographic mix, pricing, other factors. And also just on the sustainability of those drivers in terms of driving revenue over the year. Robert Hau : Yes, Ramsey. As you've heard us talk about, there's lots of variation quarter-to-quarter in terms of that spread that you talk about. There's a combination of things like mix of small businesses versus enterprise of hardware versus processing. As you heard, we introduced some new hardware in the last few months. We've got some more coming in the balance of the year. That will drive it mix of international -- there are 3 regions, LatAm, EMEA and APAC  with particular strength in LatAm and in APAC right now. More penetration of value-added services. You heard us talk about that stepping up 150 basis points to 17% in the quarter. Mix of PayFacs and ISVs and ISOs. So lots of different elements, which is why we try to push on tracking our overall revenue growth. And as you've heard us say, we're focused on getting more merchants and selling more to those merchants. And we're seeing that benefit the last several quarters, and we expect that to continue as we march towards our goal of $10 billion of revenue in this segment by 2025. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. So quite a few different factors contributing there. A follow-up for me is just on the international growth and merchant. It seemed just incredibly impressive. What are the kind of common threads between the different markets where -- that are helping to drive that growth? Is there anything that's going on outside the U.S. that's sparking that kind of growth? Frank Bisignano : Well, I think you've watched us build out our international business for years. I mean, there was a point in time where we didn't have a business. In Brazil as an example, and then we've built it out. You heard us talk about Caixa. That's still ramping up. When you look across Asia Pac, you could see us winning business there. So I think it's a tried and true as having our feet completely embedded on the ground in terms of our capability. In some cases, Clover leads. But it's always been an investment for us in innovation, running a global franchise. And I think on top of it, it's beyond the merchant. It's issuer along with it, which allows the payment segment also to get the benefit of our geographic dispersity. So it's a continuation of our strategy we laid out going back to 2020. And we'll continue to invest in those markets. We like the growth in those markets. We run those regions separately, and we feel great about our leadership on the ground there, too. Robert Hau : Ramsey, I think that's one of the distinctions for us, and it's been one of the keys to our success. We have local leadership. We don't have an international business. We have 3 regions, and those 3 regions are run by local leaders who are physically present in those regions and know those regions. We operate as a global business, and so products and solutions. Clover is a global solution but it's brought to those regions through those local regional leaders. And of course, across all of the regions, we continue to be the full partner of choice, and bank partners are one of the key methods. Frank talked about Caixa. In Europe, we announced our Deutsche Bank joint venture. We've got partnerships in Asia Pac, in Singapore and in India, et cetera. So it's a global reach with a very local leadership. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Good stuff here. Frank, you highlighted Fiserv's ongoing readiness efforts related to the rollout of FedNow coming in a few months. Can you just elaborate a bit on how you anticipate and I guess maybe how quickly you expect FedNow to begin impacting Fiserv's business and where we'll see that benefit? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean, we've always had a philosophy that we are a commerce enabler, right? So as new payment types and changes to payment types, just how we do with Zelle. If you go back to places like Apple Pay, it's just a philosophical belief that we are here to help our clients grow their business. We are here on purpose-driven method to help them run their business better. And when new initiatives like FedNow come along, and we have thousands of banks and credit unions across the country that are looking for different payment methodologies to allow them to deliver for their clients who are going to enable it. So we partner obviously with the Fed on this. I see it as another payment type. I think it's good for our large institutions and our smallest. And I suspect it will get volume. It's -- for us, it's a very good choice to enable payments, just like Zelle was a very good choice to enable payments. So we're pretty excited. Adoption will drive all. It will be a single integrated interface to allow our clients to be able to come in seamlessly through our network and I look forward to reporting on it when we talk next quarter. Lisa Dejong Ellis : Terrific. And then maybe just for my follow-up, I'll ask about investment areas because you did call out how Finxact, Ondot and some of your other recent acquisitions are having a very noticeable positive impact on Fiserv. So just looking forward, what are some of your priority investment areas like sort of the hot areas right now, [ yielding ] either for organic or inorganic investment? Frank Bisignano : Well, I would say you have to start with a series of items. Carat, Clover, we're leaning heavily on both of those. I think we've grown them organically very well. But we've also added BentoBox, Merchant One, Nextable. So you'll see us do both. I think we have a very, very strong track record. Starting with Clover, moving to Ondot, moving to BentoBox, Finxact of bringing founders in and helping them grow their business at a different level, right? I think you can see a vertical focus. You see us with driving value-added services. So I would say that's a large part of the merchant story, and that will happen in the U.S. and within our regions also. I think when you think about Finxact, you think about what I feel is the best next-generation platform out there. And both Finxact and DNA are very, very strong assets. We do have great assets like Signature also, but when you think about the buildout, you should think about us taking Finxact and DNA to the next level, to the best cloud platform in the industry between the 2 by far. And when you see the investment we're making to bring Walmart up, and they're up and running in the early stages, that will industrialize us in that platform beyond anyone's expectations when we acquired it. If you look at our payments areas, we will continue to bring in the issuing area a lot of digital innovation. We're cloud enabling those platforms to take them to the next level. I think you've seen that we've been hugely successful in the issuing area even as late as Desjardins and Target coming on. So we'll continue to invest in those platforms, growing out and bring more value-added services there, more digital capability there also. I think along with that, what we're doing with things like SpendLabs and -- is we're opening up a whole new SMB opportunity within our portfolio that we think will transfer itself whole -- our whole organization. And we believe deeply in SMB and the combo of SpendLabs and Clover and other assets that we brought onboard, and it will really allow us to even have more wallet from our SMB population. And then Ondot, you saw us take something that was a card control, card access capability and bring it into the mobile banking platforms of over 1,000 institutions. So I think you also look at the speed in which we ramp these products, the way we integrate them into the company. We think we have a pretty strong expertise in that and you can count on that, continually driving future growth for the company. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Timothy Chiodo : Great. I want to dig in a little bit more on the recent STAR and Accel wins. So you mentioned numerous of those, the Uber, the large merchant acquirer last quarter and more in the pipeline. I want to just recap the value proposition. When you're speaking with these acquirers and merchants, I'm assuming part of it is lower interchange, network fees. There might be a bundled sales approach. There might be an authorization angle. If you could recap those and maybe add to the list. And then lastly, if at all possible, if you could just comment directionally in terms of market share goals. Is the goal for U.S. online debit for STAR and Accel to be in a similar position to your share for the in-store debit market in the U.S. Frank Bisignano : So first, I think you did a pretty good job. So thank you, in describing the opportunity. And I would say, yes, we're in the client's office every day, right? Large institutions, and we're talking to them about our full capability. I'd say we get a lot of imbalance from large institutions because if you're the third debit network, I think it's a very strong position. And the combo of STAR and Accel is very, very powerful. It's good for our merchants, it's good for our issuers. And I don't want to lose that, it's a 2-sided benefit. That benefit is us having invested in these products for a long time and consistently felt that it was a value-add to our clients, both large and small. It is about technical capability, not just about a lower price, right? Of course, every one of our businesses as the industry would call them merchants, I think of them as businesses. And always working on how to get a better client experience and how to lower the cost of acceptance. We're here to provide them the enablement they need. When you think about market share, you hear us rattle off those #1s and then we rattle off #3 in debit. I think that's a pretty privileged position. Those are formidable and fabulous institutions, 1 and 2. So our job is to give our client choice, right? And if we give them choice, we do come with an all-inclusive capable set of assets that we deliver to clients. It could be a cost debit routing. It's the capabilities of Reg II. It's also the pay by bank capability that you heard about. Over time, it will potentially be things like FedNow and Zelle capability. Our job is to have the bundle, have the capability, help both issuers and merchants be able to get a better outcome. And I think we're uniquely positioned out of everybody in the industry. It's really the power of having a merchant business and issuing business, a banking business. And we're a horizontal company that allows us to partner cross-sell businesses to give the best solution for the clients. And that's why sometimes when we look at it, we look at it, how did we deliver on the top in total? And how did we deliver in margin in total and making sure we're doing the best job for our clients and our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Within the Fintech segment, the 12 core wins are certainly good to see. Can you talk about decision cycles, sales cycles and how they might be evolving post the regional bank crisis from early March? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean, first of all, I don't -- I didn't see a regional bank crisis. I saw tremendous turmoil. I think we have banks of all sizes from the largest in the world to 13-person credit unions, and there was not across -- and this is me talking to you about my interaction with my client base. In their office, during this period of time, while I was on the road, whether it was Topeka, Kansas, we saw that Missouri -- Springfield, Missouri, Raleigh, North Carolina, all across, we have very, very sound banks across this country that really performed very, very well and have always ran their asset and liability structure in a manner that I've seen through my career. So little bit -- I'm sorry for that take off, but I wouldn't want to name it as a banking crisis. There was turmoil, I see demand very high. Every one of those were creating opportunity that I rattled off during that week. I still -- I've been consistent on demand is high, opportunity to sell all products is very high. I mean, if you step back and look at of 2, FI-facing segments, you look at it over the past 3 quarters. Third quarter at 7.7% growth, fourth quarter '22 at 9.2% growth and first quarter of 23% at 9.4% growth. Those feel good to us. Our pipeline is strong both in traditional products and then in our new opportunities like Finxact and Ondot and others. So I feel very, very good about -- yes, there was maybe, as I called it, a little coastal problem. But I felt throughout the country, it's been very, very strong. And baseline to us, we were all over, how to help them through it and deliver what they needed during that turmoil. And I feel good about how the org performed. David Togut : Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, perhaps, Bob, can you talk about the key drivers of operational effectiveness or operational excellence that will sustain margin expansion in your midterm range. Robert Hau : Sure. And Dave, this is quite frankly, it's just old-fashioned productivity. This is really what has been at the core of our company for a lot of years. The last couple of years have been focused on integration and cost synergies. And so this is returning back to basics with integration synergy behind us from the large merger back in middle of '19 and getting into productivity, reevaluating how we do everything and why we do what we do. It's things like implementing our new SAP system and streamlining the process and getting more information out of the hands of our business leaders more quickly so that we can make decisions faster. And it is, like I said, evaluating what we do on a day-to-day basis and streamlining that process so we can be quicker, more nimble, satisfy our clients and serve them in the way they need to be served with greater speed and efficiency. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Great job. And maybe just my 2 questions on merchant. First one, ex Clover, it seems like you still did mid- to upper teens revenue growth in Acceptance. So I guess my question really is, are you taking sure -- even without Clover, it seems like you're taking a lot of share in the industry. Is that fair to say? Robert Hau : Yes, David, I think we had yet another very strong merchant quarter across the board. Contributions, yes, Clover continues to do well. We continue to serve our enterprise clients and gain there. Our international business, as you heard, hitting on all cylinders. So this is -- Clover is a big part of this segment, no doubt about it, and a big part of growth. But we laid out our intent, our goal to get to $10 billion by 2025. Clearly, Clover is part of that. But our enterprise clients, our non-Clover SMB clients, our international region is all part of that. And all are contributing to the growth in first quarter, and last year for that matter. David Koning : Yes. Great. And just as a follow-up, I think there might be a little misconception on the Street, just that volume growth being mid-single digits seems to be losing momentum. But when I look at it, I think over 1/3 of your volume comes from bank JVs that generate almost no revenue. And I mean, I think those -- that all could almost go away, and you still probably would have beaten consensus this quarter. Is it fair to say is that maybe where some of the slowness is where it's the very high-yielding stuff actually is growing volume quite fast? Robert Hau : Yes. Overall, it's hard to be concerned in my mind with 18% top line when we did 17% for the full year last year, and to your earlier question, and taking share across the board. There's lots of different elements to that volume. It did ease a bit, and certainly the bank joint ventures are part of that. We have some processing revenue -- processing volume that doesn't drive big revenue and big profitability for us. And obviously, we continue to focus on that. And as we talked about, geez, a little more than a year ago now. And we think that, that holds going forward from a revenue standpoint but isn't a big growth driver for us. Frank Bisignano : Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv first quarter earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from our actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another very good quarter for Fiserv. Our results continue to demonstrate strong performance in revenue and operating income with second quarter organic revenue growth of 10%, led by performance in Merchant Acceptance, particularly in our international regions, and our Payments and Network segment. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 was up 16%, and adjusted operating margin of 36.5% was up 300 basis points. All three measures are tracking ahead of our previous guidance for the full year. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we note that economists\u2019 expectations have improved for GDP and consumer spending relative to the start of the year. But those economists also forecast a modest macro slowdown from the first half, in part due to higher anticipated unemployment and the reinstatement of student loan repayment. Among our financial institution customers, spending and spending intentions remain healthy even as net interest margins narrow and lending activity eases. Card and non-card payment services, digital banking, IT modernization and data analytics are high-demand services, and financial institutions are looking to us to deliver. With the outperformance in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11%, up from 8% to 9% previously. Adjusted operating margin is now forecast to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of greater than 125 basis points. With the year-to-date adjusted EPS growth of 14% and the improved revenue and operating margin performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. These second quarter results marked our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We have also repurchased nearly 6% of our shares outstanding over the last 12 months. I am incredibly proud of the strong performance and the hard work, foresight and collaboration that it took to get here. Now I\u2019m focused on sustaining this momentum. There are multiple parts of our business that I consider future growth accelerants. I will touch on five of these today, and then we\u2019ll add and elaborate on them at our Investor Day later this year. Bob will provide more details on this later in the call. The first success story with a continuing growth outlook is Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue is growing more than 20% on $267 billion in annualized payment volume. This is a testament not only to the appeal of the product offering, but to the power of our vast distribution network. Clover has only begun to scratch the surface on the opportunity in vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software and international markets. In the restaurant vertical, we expect to offer the full suite of value-added services and point-of-sale solutions for restaurants and QSRs of all sizes next year. And we\u2019ve begun to build out vertical specialized software solutions for retail and professional services, including partnerships to manage inventory, improve SKU level analytics and manage appointment scheduling. We\u2019re also continuing to enhance our ISV partner program, giving our ISVs access to Clover hardware and processing alongside our value-added services. This will support our growth among additional verticals, including businesses in our back book. An example of this is our integration with SalonUltimate, a vertical software platform provider focused on the salon and spa industry, that will provide a broader combined offering to its large merchant base. Clover now accounts for approximately 25% of our Merchant revenue and remains on track to reach 35% by 2025, in line with our targets for $10 billion in total Merchant revenue and $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025, implying an expected growth acceleration. Following in the footsteps of Clover is Carat, our unified commerce offering for omni-channel merchants. Like Clover, Carat is an operating system that delivers both payments and experiences, but instead of small businesses, Carat is for the world\u2019s leading brands and large enterprises. Carat has been posting revenue growth in the mid-teens on the strength of Fiserv\u2019s scale, flexibility and customization capability, plus key integrated services and broad payment options. We recently released our two biggest differentiators for Carat : Commerce Hub, which is the orchestration layer that enables easy client access to our products and services; and a data and insights command center that lets clients manage their data in real-time to better engage end customers and improve operating efficiencies. Over time, as with Clover, we\u2019ll add more first and third-party value-added services and payment flows and increase accessibility around the world. A third area of growth is digital payments and the intersection with digital banking. CardHub is our card account product for debit card issuers that offers all of the newest features for cardholders to manage their accounts. It helps out small and midsized bank issuer clients offer their customers the same cutting-edge functionality as the largest independent card issuers. We\u2019re about halfway through migrating financial institution clients onto CardHub where they can integrate with our digital mobile banking product, Mobiliti, and with competing digital banking providers. This migration has shown a doubling of customer adoption on CardHub in the first year, which means greater card usage, reduced call center activity and better security. Ensuring new clients to our digital banking solutions, we then tend to bundle our debit processing, debit network and risk services. The full integration of CardHub and Mobiliti is an investment unique at Fiserv because it spans two operating segments, Payments and Fintech, where others don\u2019t participate. Our card solution was strengthened by two acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, in 2021. And it\u2019s just one example of the many cross-selling opportunities specific to Fiserv given our integration work and breadth of capability. A fourth growth area is Latin America. Although we haven\u2019t spoken in depth about our international operations, Latin America has been a standout grower in recent quarters, and we believe it can remain so for the long term. We\u2019ve built a leading franchise across multiple countries and leading financial institutions that spans our product set from merchant acceptance to card issuing to fintech. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue. And in Merchant Acceptance, it\u2019s 10% of adjusted revenue. It\u2019s largely driven by Argentina and Brazil followed by Mexico, Colombia and several others. Argentina has garnered attention lately for 100%-plus inflation. And while this has certainly contributed to some of our Merchant segment\u2019s strength, a bigger and more sustainable part of the growth comes from anticipation revenue, also known as merchant prepayments. This is where we help merchants navigate the long settlement variance in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay by funding their payment receivables early at a discounted rate. Businesses get better liquidity, and we receive a spread that carries low risk. Other parts of our LatAm business shows strong momentum as well. We will be expanding our relationship with our partner, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, enabling card payment for their more than 13,000 bill payment agencies throughout Brazil. Fiserv solution will allow agencies to extend bill payment options from only cash and Caixa debit cards today to all credit, debit and prepaid cards. The opportunity is meaningful when considering that in 2022, this agent network enabled bill payments equal to about 11% of all credit and debit payments in Brazil. We are also enabling PIX transactions in Brazil in the P2B space, utilizing our Software Express platform and expanding our presence in PIX beyond P2B. We have also made PIX payments capability available in our large acquiring network in Argentina, supporting Brazilians visiting this neighboring country. We\u2019re excited for the opportunities presented by PIX, and it has already exceeded total card sales volume in Brazil in a short period of time. A fifth opportunity is Finxact. Finxact is the acquisition we made in April of last year to offer a next-generation core banking system that\u2019s cloud-native. It gives us the opportunity to compete and win with financial institutions of all sizes and across geographies, expanding our total addressable market. Our three-prong strategy is to win digital-first banks, provide next-generation core banking through our existing FI clients and add larger banks as clients often starting as they launch new products in the cloud. Another opportunity in Finxact that\u2019s coming together now actually started many years ago. We were an initial investor in Finxact when it began raising money in 2017 because we saw value in marrying a merchant processing platform with a back-office banking platform. Today, that\u2019s called embedded finance, and we are beginning to tap into the opportunity as merchants look to offer banking services to their customers. Their goal is typically to provide more purchasing power and payment flexibility to their customers while creating deeper relationships. Embedded finance will add to the many payment and banking solutions that merchants want to offer and we already provide. Here are some examples. We deliver stored value and gift card solutions to many of the world\u2019s leading brands. We\u2019re the largest private label credit card provider, and we are the processor behind most HSA and FSA accounts. Finxact is the single ledger and issuing platform for products like debit cards and DDAs. And from here, we\u2019re investing in the connectivity between platforms to create a more seamless experience for our clients and their end customers. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I\u2019ll cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our second quarter was a very good one and marked our ninth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. Total company organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and Payments and Network. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment which grew 16%. Our three international regions also continued to perform well, growing 31% organically in the second quarter. We saw strong growth in the issuer solutions revenue across all three regions and robust gains in Latin America for our Merchant segment. As Frank explained, while Argentina inflation grabs the headlines, the bigger driver of our growth here is anticipation revenue, reflecting a newer business for us in Merchant prepayments. In the near future, inflation in Argentina may ease, but it\u2019s likely to stay persistently high relative to the rest of the world. Our broad franchise, new lines of business and strong growth in the rest of the region should balance out any single country\u2019s macroeconomic issues. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 16% to $1.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 36.5%, an increase of 300 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $8.8 billion and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $3.1 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.1%, an increase of 240 basis points versus last year and tracking ahead of our 2023 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 16% to $1.81 compared to $1.56 in the prior year. Year-to-date through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.38 at the high end of our 12% to 14% annual guidance range. Free cash flow came in at $608 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the first six months of the year, up 16% year-to-date. Our free cash flow remains on track to reach $3.8 billion this year, and we\u2019ve retained line of sight to accelerating cash flow generation in the second half as is typical for our business. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 14% in the quarter and 16% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 10% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 1% compared to prior year. This lower volume performance reflects two temporary factors. First is the decline in retail fuel prices of 27% on average in the quarter, which creates a tough comparison for petrol merchant volume growth. The second is related to some strategic realignment among large processing clients that\u2019s impacting their volumes and represents a large portion of our processing-only volume. Excluding these two isolated factors, volume growth would have been 4%. It\u2019s important to note that volume changes for both petrol and processing-only clients had very little impact on our revenue since petrol clients typically pay per transaction and processing carries very low fees. Nevertheless, they are big contributors to volume and thus the spread between our volume growth and revenue growth is particularly wide now. This should moderate over time. Other factors contributing to the wider spread are rising penetration of software and services and pricing benefits from both higher inflation and added value. We expect these to be positive contributors to revenue on an ongoing basis. Clover, our operating system for small- and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand our revenue opportunity with them. Clover posted a strong 23% revenue growth for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $67 billion and $267 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 16%, 1 point above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. We signed 40 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 77 year-to-date. Our momentum is starting to build with PayFac as well with the signing of Waystar and Pay Theory during the second quarter. Clover Sport added a relationship with a large service provider for the Cleveland Browns Stadium and other venues. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 6% in the second quarter. Excluding the loss of a Latin America processing client that began taking its business in-house, Carat grew 14%. While our relationship with the client remains good, we\u2019re focused on growing our higher-value direct business. The underlying Carat business remains strong. We\u2019ve expanded our merchant processing relationship with Inspire Brands, the second-largest restaurant company in the United States, to include several more of their restaurant concepts while continuing our relationship with their Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic brands. The agreement will add several thousand additional restaurant locations to our processing portfolio. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 21% to $718 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 34.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 20% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 280 basis points to 32.7%. Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter, once again above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in the segment included active accounts on file in North American credit processing business; the Output Solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by continued growth in both the number of clients and transaction growth. As we\u2019ve said, we expect tough comparisons through the rest of the year as we anniversary a large new client onboarding completed in mid-2022. Still, we anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be towards the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Also notable for this segment, two new payments initiatives took effect this month, offering incremental revenue opportunities for Fiserv over time. First, July 1 was the effective date of the Fed\u2019s final rule clarifying parts of Regulation II to make explicit that at least two debit network routing options are required for card-not-present transactions. For our STAR and Accel debit networks, which have been supporting CNP for years, this led to more than 80 of our current issuing clients enabling card-not-present, adding active cards for e-commerce transactions. This is a growth opportunity that we did not previously have. We also won several large e-commerce merchants as clients, including, in the second quarter, Lyft, ADT and T-Mobile. Last week, the Fed launched its real-time payment system, FedNow. So we are now live with six banks in the pilot phase and more than 70 committed to go live so far this year. We are encouraged by the opportunity to add more financial institutions since more than 1,000 of them are already connected to our NOW Network for Zelle, providing a single point of integration that could be leveraged by FIs to easily add new rails. That\u2019s a major differentiator for Fiserv. But the key to FedNow adoption is compelling use cases, which we think will grow over time, most likely in commercial payments and bill pay spaces. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 17% to $782 million and adjusted operating margin was up 360 basis points to 47.4% in the quarter, driven by our strong revenue growth and productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 16% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 240 basis points to 45.6%. Moving to Slide 7. Organic revenue in the Financial Technology segment declined 1% in the second quarter, resulting in 1% growth for the first half. High periodic revenue in the second quarter of 2022 drove a difficult comparison this quarter, creating a 3-point headwind. We continue to expect organic growth within the guidance range of 4% to 6% this year as in-year revenue is booked and implementation work on prior wins is completed. Adjusted operating income was up 1% in the quarter to $285 million and up 2% to $565 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 130 basis points to 36.3% in the quarter. For the first half, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin grew 60 basis points to 35.8%. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including four wins for DNA, our market-recognized leading modern core banking platform for banks and credit unions. Fintech showcased its extensibility as an enabler of embedded finance with the win at Pay Theory. This payment facilitator serves the education and the health care sectors and plans to enable a suite of banking-as-a-service and money movement capabilities for its vertical SaaS partners. We are integrating Fintech with our merchant PFAC platform to enable Pay Theory to extend its vertical SaaS capability to banking and payments. Our goal is to provide a single integration for vertical SaaS providers who want to leverage assets across our banking, payments and merchant businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $142 million in the quarter and $264 million year-to-date. The slight increase over the first half last year is largely impacted by expenses tied to our client conference, which we held in-person for the first time since the pandemic. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6% and was 19.8% for the first half. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total outstanding debt was $23.2 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.9 times. During the second quarter, we issued \u20ac800 million of eight-year senior notes to replace notes that matured in early July and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 13% of total. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 8.6 million shares for $1 billion and 21.8 million shares for $2.5 billion over the last six months. We had 70.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. As we continue to optimize our vast product portfolio for value and strategic fit, yesterday, we completed the sale of two financial reconciliation products to Trintech for roughly $230 million. We are fully committed to our longstanding disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our businesses organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. First half organic revenue growth was well ahead of our prior guidance for the full year, so we are again raising the range from 8% to 9%, to 9% to 11%, which considers economists\u2019 range of second half outcomes. Based on the strong second quarter results and higher anticipated organic revenue growth, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.30 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin now expected to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of greater than 125 basis points. Lastly, we\u2019re excited to announce our upcoming Investor Day in New York City on Wednesday, November 15, so please save the date. We\u2019ll spend time going deeper on our growth strategies, and you\u2019ll see how they factor into our outlook when we update our medium-term guidance. It will be a great opportunity to get to know our management team and see some of our products in action. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I\u2019d like to acknowledge our corporate social responsibility programming because it continues to support better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. You\u2019ll find many examples in our annual CSR report published in May. Highlights this quarter include growth in our employee resource groups and internal mobility; additional grants for small business under our back-to-business program; and awards and recognition as a top employer for veterans and National Guard members. We\u2019re also in the process of submitting data to the Carbon Disclosure Project, or CDP, for the third straight year. Finally, I\u2019d like to leave you with some important perspective from our annual client conference, Forum, which we hosted in June. For the first time since the pandemic, we were able to meet with thousands of clients and prospects in person. Together, they represented over 50% of our revenue from financial institution clients. We hosted education sessions on real-time payments, embedded finance and cloud modernization, and an experience center that showcased key products like CardHub, Digital Banking, Finxact and the new Clover Kitchen Display System. As gratifying as this was, the more meaningful takeaways for me can be summed up in three themes I heard from clients again and again. One, they love our products and they\u2019re ready to spend. Our core banking systems, especially Premier for community banks and DNA, our most modern cloud-enabled core, are coveted by bank and credit union CIOs. Our smaller clients remain largely untouched by the March banking turmoil. And our larger clients have one eye on the regulatory environment and the other on how we can help them accelerate their growth. Two, they are rooting for our innovations. Small and midsized financial institutions see Fiserv as their champion for the latest technology solutions. They\u2019re relying on us for their digital and mobile banking, top-tier features in card services, and data and analytics. Three, they have noted our improved service. We\u2019ve already made strong progress in client service with our relationship management model over the past year. Most recently, as an example of our operational excellence initiative this year, we launched a commitment tracker where clients can view the deliverables we promised and track their progress. It\u2019s the first-of-its-kind in the industry for transparency and accountability, and financial institutions now have one more reason to choose Fiserv. So to conclude, as we approach the anniversary of our merger exactly four years ago this week, we are gratified that our vision and execution have proven out with results that exceeded expectations. From here, the combination of our investment, innovation and talented workforce mean the next four years tend to be even better. And now, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the acceleration in Clover revenue growth. Noting the long-term plan to continue to accelerate Clover revenue growth, if we zoom in a little closer on to the next, let\u2019s say, 6 to 12 months, would you expect this trend to continue? Frank Bisignano : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean as you\u2019ve heard us talk over time, we continue to have tons of opportunity, both in the ISV and our day-to-day operating business itself, we expect it to have an acceleration. You\u2019ll see us bringing more software into the product set, vertical solutions. We believe we have a long, long opportunity set in front of us. Remember, we haven\u2019t gone to the back book at all. That\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s not anywhere in our guide, that back book opportunity. You should expect us also to continue to add services, and that\u2019s really driving that penetration. So in our vision and in our visibility, we see a continuing acceleration of Clover growth and then we also have international. David Togut : Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, the 80 issuers that you enabled for card-not-present on STAR and Accel, is there any way you can quantify potential volume from those issuers over the next year or so? Frank Bisignano : Well, I\u2019ve been super guarded on this item. As I like to say, we\u2019re in early innings. We can only get volume without enablement. So step 1 is enablement. Step 2 is also, as you heard us talking about, merchants wanting it. And you heard us talked to a few today of large players there. I think as we come closer and we talk at Investor Day, you\u2019ll get better visibility to this. It\u2019s not even early innings, it\u2019s the first at bat, really. But we have demand, we have issuer compliance with us on it and we have opportunity in front of us. And fundamentally, I\u2019d like to say, none of this is in today\u2019s set of numbers or the guide that we\u2019re talking to you about. David Togut : Understood. Thanks so much. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Guys, thanks. Frank, I know you touched on the Forum, but I\u2019d love to just hear your thoughts on demand from the banks right now and just in the context of the environment we\u2019re in going into this quarter as well as volume trends in just merchant, more importantly, consumer trends into July, what you\u2019re seeing across the ecosystem domestically and maybe internationally also. Frank Bisignano : Let me talk about Forum because it was our really first post-merger physical Forum. We had done virtual ones, but demand gen at a virtual conference is not very high. The ability for our leadership team to touch thousands of clients, and we made a point of that, lots of listening sessions, lots of meetings. And that\u2019s why I go through those three bullets that their desire to engage and spend is very high. Their desire to have us be part of their embedded strategy to help them grow their bank is very high. We watch the response to the commitment tracker. The fact that we want to lead the industry and meeting our commitments, you could hear somebody who is at the conference like Banc of California yesterday talk on their merger call about the strategic partnership they have with us. Their CIO was there. I heard from their CEO yesterday and their CIO. So we\u2019re part of our clients\u2019 growth strategy. We love driving it. It\u2019s not a core-only play, it\u2019s everything we bring around it. When you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve done, the receptivity to CardHub through Ondot, then I think you\u2019d find the core competency in this company no longer for tuck-ins, but for acquisitions that we could do at a size and then turn it into a completely different capability. So demand is high, super high. Finxact, the amount of time Finxact got attention at Forum was off the charts. And it is the industry leader in current instances in the space it plays. I think relative to the consumer, they have a lot weighing on them now. They have the student debt issue. They have rising interest rates, and you\u2019ve seen a moderation in volume. You\u2019ve heard it and I think you\u2019ll hear it across the industry, our business \u2013 July is similar to what we saw in the quarter. But our business mix has allowed us to deliver so many other services, leading with Clover, following with the other value-added services that allows us to be able to be in a position we are and we think we\u2019re fortunate and blessed. Robert Hau : Darrin, just to add on Forum, as a guy who went to three or four of them pre-merger, so the last time we had in-person, the tone of the conversation and the depth of the conversations was quite different this time. Deep innovation, partnership conversations, a change in customer service that is being experienced by our clients and echo the \u2013 Frank talked about the commitment tracker, our willingness to be very transparent on what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it and the openness of our solution, enabling much wider breadth of capability, not only stuff that we bring, and that\u2019s increased over time with our Payments and Fintech segment, both serving financial institutions, but having those open APIs and the Developer Studio that we announced a couple of quarters ago, giving our clients [Multiple Speakers] this. Frank Bisignano : Yes, there\u2019s probably \u2013 I\u2019ll just add one other item, maybe two. One is our clients\u2019 willingness to want to engage and talk to us about their innovation needs. It can only \u2013 I\u2019ve said for a long time, innovation happens in the client\u2019s office, not in our Sunnyvale office. And two, needless to say, when you\u2019re in that environment, your pipeline build opportunity in the current and the future is very, very strong, and the amount of follow-up meetings are ever off the charts. Darrin Peller : That\u2019s great. Guys, when we \u2013 just my quick follow-up is just back to the spread between volume and revenue at Merchant. If we just took out the things out of your control like gas prices and process and the inflation, for example, and we just focused on pricing and software as a penetration, maybe even just focusing on the customers that are \u2013 you\u2019re just processing for and have low revenue, how do we think about sustainability of those factors driving better revenue and for how long? Robert Hau : Look, obviously, we believe the opportunity to continue to add value-added services and deepen that penetration. In our Merchant investor call, geez, a little more than a year ago now, we talked about Clover mass penetration reaching 25% by 2025. We\u2019re off to a good start. We continue to focus on it. We continue to develop new capabilities there, and so we see that as an ongoing growth engine. And in terms of pricing, it\u2019s about value-add pricing. It\u2019s delivering the value to the client and then getting paid for that. So value-add pricing is sustainable. There\u2019s certainly an element of a benefit of inflation in a different environment today. But we\u2019re, quite frankly, we\u2019re much more focused on creating that value for our clients and then being paid for it. Frank Bisignano : Yes. And I mean just a very simple way of thinking here, we like to add merchants and we like to add them with multiple products and continue to sell products into our back book also. Darrin Peller : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. Nice results here. Frank, I know you called out LatAm as a standout. You guys have had good results there. I mean just love your thoughts on some of the recent M&A in the region with Visa buying Pismo. I think EVERTEC also bought a fintech platform. Is there anything going on there that might change things competitively? Frank Bisignano : Well, I\u2019d go back to our Brazil business, which really is the largest business in Latin America and the rest of the region keys off of, in many ways, was created from scratch organically. And we built that business organically and then done some strategic things. I mean you hear us talking about Software Express, that was a very, very small acquisition that we believe could transcend our business throughout Latin America. We added tremendous banking franchises. I mean you look at what we talked about on Caixa here, right, we talked about the first leg of that, which was a very large deal that put us in fundamentally every city in Brazil with the leading bank in terms of size and scale. And then we came back \u2013 because of such a good job that we did, right, they came back and we went to work on what fundamentally are, call it, their lottery agencies. And BillPay is taking it and came up with a strategy that would take us to 11% of the payments. So we have great organic capability in Latin America. We brought Clover to Argentina. And we spent a lot of time, and the Argentinian platform changed and allowed it to be a dual acquirer as opposed to a single acquirer. And so those are all strategic things that happened there. So I guess what I\u2019m really saying at the core is when we came into Brazil, we were actually the only U.S. player because everybody had retreated. And we had a deep belief with good leadership on the ground would in fact \u2013 remember, we don\u2019t run an international business. We run three regional businesses, and then we dropped down to a model where country hedge drives the P&L there, but we run global business solutions. So I think our model is strong. I think that the action in these countries has always been going on, Darrin [sic] [Tien-Tsin]. And I think we like our hand, and we believe that these are strategic and will be opportunities for more, Tien-Tsin. So thank you. Tien- Tsin Huang : No, I appreciate that answer, and I know you guys have really upsold Caixa, so it\u2019s a great case study. My quick follow-up then for Bob, just thinking about the raised revenue and the margins, but no raise in the free cash flow, is this a timing issue given the higher working capital, the CAPI software investments in some of these growth areas? And can we expect free cash conversion to improve beyond fiscal \u201823? Robert Hau : Yes, Tien-Tsin, you hit it right on the head. Obviously, we\u2019ve raised the revenue guidance, and so that will bring additional working capital. And of course, as we continue to see opportunities to grow the top line with now nine quarters of consecutive double-digit growth, there\u2019s investment opportunity out there. So we continue to feel quite good at delivering the approximately $3.8 billion and see the benefit of that as working capital comes in and gets collected. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yep. Well done. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask about Carat. You highlighted Carat was up 6% as reported, 14% excluding the one client roll-off there. Can you give us a little additional color, one, on just how we should be thinking about the scale of Carat within the Merchant business, either on sort of a revenue or a volume basis? I know it\u2019s like a subset of the enterprise segment, which you\u2019ve disclosed. And then also just elaborate a little bit on competitively how you see this platform is differentiated and whether or not Carat is \u2013 what this \u2013 is this mostly like new client sales? Or is a lot of this migrating existing enterprise clients onto an omni-platform? Just a little bit of elaboration there would be great. Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Hey, thanks, Lisa. Thank you very much. I think, first of all, think of Carat as a go-to-market product for both our current book coming over, but that has not been where we\u2019ve focused the growth effort. Sitting under it is an orchestration layer, which is created as Commerce Hub. And those first migrations will begin probably in the fourth quarter through the rest of time. And those will be new client migrations, right? This is a customized solution for the client that gives them total flexibility. I mean, look, we think it\u2019s a double-digit \u2013 clear double-digit growth engine for us. We think it will scale over time. You should think about it, as we talked about over time, what type of e-com business we have total, obviously, enterprise piece is smaller than our total piece that we\u2019ve talked about to you all. And I think you should think about it as a business that will continue to be powerful, call it several hundred millions of dollars growing double digits. And so hopefully, that frames the size of the opportunity. We have a large pipeline on it. We\u2019re in execution mode. And we think, much like we believe Clover has become an industry leader, we believe Carat will be the industry leader. Lisa Ellis : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up, also just staying within Merchant for a second. If I think back to the deep dive you did on Merchant a year-and-a-half ago, I think you were expecting the processing piece of Merchant to be sort of flattish through 2025. In light of what you called out today, the sort of roll-off of one of \u2013 or at least a portion of one of your big processing clients, does that sort of change that outlook? Or maybe taking a step back sort of strategically, how are you thinking about the role of your processing business within Merchant going forward as you\u2019re seeing such strong growth from Clover? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I think nothing has changed in our point of view. And maybe we could step back here to the day that Stripe left us. Maybe I remember it more, I announced to you that Stripe is leaving as a processing client within a JV. And I think people really thought, wow, but it ended up fine. If you think back, we continue to add processing clients. In many cases, sometimes we help processing clients grow and they leave other services with us. So I treat processing like it\u2019s that $1 billion business and it\u2019s fundamentally flat, and there\u2019s been adds. And you have large scale to lease, but it has very little processing revenue impact because of how you all \u2013 why I always try to talk us off this volume versus revenue issue because we have a lot of processing volume, but it\u2019s not the largest part of our business. So I would think about it exactly how we presented it. We will have volume leave on a quarter and we add volume back at other points in time. Does that make sense? Lisa Ellis : Yes. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. I just wanted to stay on Merchant to start. Can you put a finer point on where you expect Merchant revenue growth to land for the full year? And just as we start tuning back half of the year models, how much will this spread between revenue growth and volume growth potentially shrink in Q4 as you lap some of the discrete pricing actions you have taken? Robert Hau : Yes, Jason, from an overall standpoint outlook for the balance \u2013 or for the full year, we previously guided 10% to 13% for 2023 on an organic basis. Now given the strength that we\u2019ve seen in the first half and an improved outlook for the second half of the year and people still talking about recession, but more people are talking about a recession in 2024, the term soft landing is starting to come into lexicon periodically. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re quite there yet, but we\u2019ll see what the Fed does today. But things have certainly modestly improved in terms of the expectation for the second half of the year. So we now think the full year will be in the, call it, the 14% to 17% organic growth rate for our Merchant business. Continue to see good performance across the gamut with Clover continuing to perform quite well in terms of continuing the value-added service capability and the penetration of BaaS into the Clover portfolio and some of the things you\u2019ve heard us talk about, both in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A around the Carat and international growth providing a nice lift there. Jason Kupferberg : And just on that spread narrowing potentially in Q4, just any modeling help you want to give us on that, so we don\u2019t get caught offside there? Robert Hau : In terms of volume versus revenue spread? Jason Kupferberg : Yes, exactly, just because some of the discrete pricing actions you took last year, I believe, in Q4. Robert Hau : Yes. And obviously, there\u2019s lots of puts and takes, and then we continue to try to drive folks into focusing on revenue. There\u2019s more and more revenue that is not tied directly to volume, and we\u2019ve now been showing that quarter in and quarter out. So I think I\u2019ll stick to the 14% to 17% full year outlook, and I feel pretty good about that. Jason Kupferberg : And just as a follow-up on Fintech, just the visibility on the second half acceleration, I guess, implied in the reiteration of the full year guide and maybe some color on how you see Q3 versus Q4 because I know the comps are pretty lumpy during the back half of the year. Thank you. Robert Hau : Yes, definitely. And so we do have good visibility into this space. And to your point, there\u2019s lumpy quarters, as you may recall, and this will play in this \u2013 the third quarter and the fourth quarter. On a comparison this year, we had a what was felt by many as a difficult third quarter last year. And during the third quarter earnings call, we reiterated our full year outlook at 4% to 6% then. Fully expected the fourth quarter to rebound given the timing of both periodic revenue and some \"one-time type\" nonrecurring revenue that we see, what we refer to as in-year activity, particularly when clients are implementing. And we obviously have good visibility into the backlog of our implementation cycle. So we feel good about being able to deliver that 4% to 6%. We recovered and delivered last year quite well. That will drive different comparisons. First half was actually a more difficult comparison than second half last year. And then within the second half, third quarter will be an easier compare than fourth quarter, and so you\u2019ll see some continued lumpiness there. But we feel good about the overall visibility and our ability to deliver that range. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. David Koning : Yes. Hey, guys, congrats on four years. Great job. Robert Hau : Thanks, Dave. David Koning : And yes, I guess one of the key highlights to me in the quarter, the margins in Merchant, you had one of the best probably ever incremental margins, both year-over-year and sequentially, about 75% of the revenue growth hit the profit line. And I\u2019m just wondering if \u2013 is that sustainable? And what exactly drove that \u2013 what drove such \u2013 is it mix? Or what was that? Robert Hau : Yes, we\u2019ve definitely had a good fall-through on that incremental. We saw similar levels fourth quarter of last year and definitely had continuing good fall-through over the last several years as we continue to expand margin pretty meaningfully. And it\u2019s the benefit of overall volume and a scaled business, a very scaled business. And it\u2019s the benefit of productivity, and we continue to drive productivity. Back in \u201819 and \u201820, we used the term synergy, which really is a synonym to productivity in many cases, particularly inside the Merchant business that didn\u2019t have a lot of direct cost synergy as we merged. We drove real productivity, and we continue to do that. So we feel good about margin expansion overall, delivering 150 basis points margin expansion or better this year, up from the 125, and we think there\u2019s continued opportunity here going forward. David Koning : Great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Clover revenue, about 8% above volume growth. So that\u2019s part of the spread. Is that both product and pricing? And is that sustainable, too? Robert Hau : Yes, absolutely. Again, we have a long path of continued penetration of value-added services that very much adds to that \"spread\" between revenue and volume at 16% this quarter, headed to 25% in 2025. And as we continue to provide value to our business customers and allow them to focus on running their business versus handling the payments and all of the ancillary services that are available on our Clover software operating system, that value translates into pricing opportunity and margin for us. David Koning : Gotcha. Thanks, guys. Great job. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys, and let me echo, congratulations on the strong results. Frank, one of the secrets has been the growth you guys have gotten through acquisitions and value-added services and especially looking at the Merchant segment. What\u2019s the pipeline look like for M&A? And are there deals out there you want to make to continue to add and push up revenue growth above volume growth through acquisitions and value-added services? Frank Bisignano : Well, I mean we\u2019ve been looking at our history, whether it\u2019s BentoBox, whether it\u2019s Finxact, whether it\u2019s Ondot, right, Software Express, right? That\u2019s why I made my comment, they\u2019re no longer tuck-ins, they\u2019re more horizontal leverage. We have lots of minority investments that we hang out with, we get to know. I think that\u2019s why our success rate. So if you went to the people at Ondot, they\u2019re so delighted on how they integrated into a mobile banking platform that would have never been where they were headed. They were card control only. If you want to get BentoBox, their ability to come across in total. So we stay close to a lot of start-ups. We make minority investments in start-ups. We get to know them and then we get a really good shot at turning them into way more value. We have a fabulous track record of keeping founders. I\u2019m darn proud of that. They become part of the fabric of the company. So yes, I think you should expect us to do more of those, less talk goes on here. Bryan Keane : Okay, great. I know we\u2019re running a little long. So I\u2019ll pass the line. Thanks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bryan. Robert Hau : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Let me add my congratulations as well on the good quarter. If I can ask, Frank, you mentioned a couple of times over the last few quarters, Clover isn\u2019t necessarily being applied to the back book. Could you talk about the opportunity there? It seems to me, the yield that you\u2019re increasingly getting from Clover, as the capability set increases, is better and better. So if you could talk through that plan, that would be great. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean, first of all, I think what you\u2019re asking \u2013 you broke up a little bit, but I want to make sure I understood. Are you asking about what we\u2019re going to do at Clover into the back book? Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking, Frank. Frank Bisignano : What\u2019s the size of that prize? Well, start at a, when we did our March Investor Day on the Merchant business, there was no Clover back book consideration into that. There was consideration from going into the back book and selling more value-added services. But you should expect us, at some point, to strategically lean in, but that\u2019s an opportunity in front of us. I think we see the ability to actually go into our current Clover client base and bring more software services. And we think, obviously, that continues driving the spread between volume and revenue growth in Clover. But I\u2019ve been on the Clover journey 10 years back to \u2013 maybe it\u2019s really heading to 11-plus years, but really counted right, sorry about that, and that started with a few engineers and a few patents. I still believe we\u2019re in the super early innings in the amount of real estate we have that we can utilize with Clover and the amount of real estate we have inside our client base that can allow us to bring Clover. But go back to it\u2019s fundamentally not in our guide that we gave in last year, and you should expect us to give you a super-duper deep dive on this at Investor Day. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Great. And then a quick question with regard to the sale of the financial reconciliation business. I might have missed it, but what\u2019s the revenue and profit impact of that? I did see the proceeds, $230 million. Frank Bisignano : Yes. Let me make a point on that. You will always look at us looking at our strategic position. We believe we\u2019re an industry leader. We have to be a top three player. We want to be prudent about capital allocation and where we deploy our internal capital. And for us and our clients, we were not the industry leader. We did a good job for them. It is not a future growth engine of the company. And so that\u2019s fundamentally how that decision gets made, right? And you will continue to see us do this. You saw us do that with Korea. So I want you to have that framework. Robert Hau : And Ashwin, in terms of size, this is a very small business. Order of magnitude, it\u2019s less than 0.2% of last year\u2019s revenue. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Look forward to talking to you in the future, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. That concludes the call for today. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded at this time. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss how Fiserv continues to deliver very strong results. For the third quarter, we posted 12% organic revenue growth with margin expansion of 290 basis points to 38.1% on an adjusted basis. These results reflect an acceleration in our Merchant Acceptance and Fintech segment organic revenue growth to 20% and 6%, respectively. While all three segments contributed to higher margin, adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 was up 20%. Cash flow was strong as well with $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date. Once again, strong quarterly results point to full year performance ahead of our prior guidance. In the closing month of 2023, market projections in consumer spending and card account growth in the U.S. point to consistency versus third quarter levels, which would mean some softening year-over-year. Macro uncertainty remains high, but we are confident in our ability to continue to add new clients, grow with and retain existing ones and expand our share of wallet with all of them. Because of this, we expect to close the year with growth similar to the year-to-date results. We also look to the more durable characteristics of our business to support our optimism. Nearly half of our volume in our Merchant business is in nondiscretionary spending categories. Approximately 85% of our financial institutions revenue is recurring. Our solutions in both areas service essential functions for our clients. Our customer base and distribution network are industry-leading. Our incremental margins are high, and our expense base benefits from technology-driven efficiencies and discretionary investment that we can adjust to match market conditions. It is these characteristics that helped us deliver 37 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, and 2023 year-to-date results point to this being our 38th year. Our strong execution across these factors leads us to raise our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth to reach 11%, the top end of our prior range of 9% to 11%; and our adjusted operating margin to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of at least 150 basis points of expansion. With this, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, up $0.05 at the midpoint and representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance from $3.8 billion to approximately $4 billion this year. The third quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth, and we are focused on sustaining this momentum. Last quarter, I talked about five powerful opportunities that can help us do this. So I\u2019ll share some proof points we achieved in the third quarter. Let\u2019s start with Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter to 26% from 23% in Q2 on $272 billion in annualized payment volume, up 15%. We released a new Clover dashboard with improved user experience that expedites navigation to our top apps, including reporting and analytics. We added other features that speeds the buying process Clover.com and improved the application process for new merchant prospects. We expect this functionality to open opportunities for Clover with a long tail of merchants growing our addressable market. Value-added solutions penetration continues to grow, reaching 17% in the quarter. We see plenty of white space still ahead, including with vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software in international markets. We\u2019re retaining line of sight to an acceleration of revenue growth that results in $3.5 billion-plus in Clover revenue by 2025, the target laid out at our March 2022 investor presentation. Moving to Carat, our unified commerce offering for omnichannel merchants. We added several new enterprise clients and relationship extensions, including a large petrol seller and a major grocery chain, adding to our nondiscretionary spending categories. We continue to drive value-added solutions with enterprise clients. And wins in the quarter came from products addressing feedbacks and platforms, foreign currency translation, fraud and hotel and restaurants with BentoBox. We\u2019re pleased to announce that PayPal has selected Fiserv as its core U.S. partner for payment services across both PayPal and Braintree assets. This is a new direct strategic multiyear partnership covering several products and services and millions of merchant locations that builds on a long-standing base of business between our two companies. International expansion continues with Carat, and we had several wins in the quarter across our regions. In EMEA, we won a competitive bid to help Compass Group, the world\u2019s largest contract foodservice company, built unattended food retail services across 14 countries in Europe. We are providing acquiring, local payment methods and real-time inventory data across our single Carat omnichannel platform for Europe. Our differentiation was in our functionality around data normalization, real-time access, visualization and reporting depth and breadth. Asia Pacific, we extended our global merchant acquiring relationship with Avis Budget, one of the world\u2019s largest car rental providers, into Australia and New Zealand. And lastly, an emerging opportunity for us in the enterprise space is Open Data. We logged two important wins in this area in the third quarter that demonstrate strong demand for access to our vast alternative data assets. One of the major credit bureaus will use our account-level data to add micro-indicators to a consumer\u2019s credit profile, particularly relevant for the underbanked. Secondly, we\u2019re partnering with Dun & Bradstreet to add information from our merchant volume database to supplement its small business credit reports. This solution can optimize credit decisioning for lenders and access to capital for small businesses. Finally, in the area of Payments in open banking, we signed a deal with Plaid for API access to bank data, allowing the company to move further away from screen-scraping and generating revenue for us and our connected banking credit union clients. We can further penetrate this data market opportunity by contributing in areas such as ID verification, account verification, loan origination and security and fraud services. Latin America represents another standout growth opportunity. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue, and in Merchant Acceptance, it\u2019s 10% of adjusted revenue. It\u2019s largely driven by Argentina and Brazil, followed by Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and the Caribbean. Argentina inflation anticipation revenue have grabbed much of the attention here. But our business in the region is well diversified with multiple growth drivers across products and countries. Even as we look to presumably less inflation and slower anticipation growth in Argentina next year, we see plenty of opportunities for strong growth in the region. These include instant payments in Brazil and Argentina, revenue growth on our Software Express rails for expanding the payments functionality for this leading retail software business that we acquired in 2018. We expanded on this opportunity earlier this month when we acquired Skytef, the largest distributor of Software Express in Brazil. With it, we added hundreds of ISV partners, 27,000 merchants and the ability to cross-sell multiple value- added solutions : Ramping up new business with Caixa Bank, including acceptance at 13,000 bill payment facilities across Brazil; rolling out Clover more broadly in Brazil next year; and expanding our issuer processing footprint with FirstVision in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Elevated inflation and high interest anticipation revenue in Latin America have contributed to the high teens growth we are posting this year in our Merchant business, well ahead of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The macro forces contributing to this greater than anticipated growth will likely ease over time, and this assumption is fully incorporated in our plan to achieve $10 billion of Merchant revenue by 2025. And finally, in the area of digital payments, we were very happy to introduce yesterday our partnership with Melio, a leading B2B payments platform. This marks a significant step forward for Fiserv in this very large and growing market. Together with Melio, we will enable financial institutions to better meet the payment needs of small businesses and level the playing field with emerging software-led competitors. We will combine Melio\u2019s well-known, easy-to-use accounts payable and receivable workflows with Fiserv\u2019s market-leading biller and merchant network, plus payment capabilities. By summer 2024, we will go to market with CashFlow Central by Fiserv, an integrated accounts payable and receivable solution for small businesses through Fiserv financial institution clients. This exclusive distribution agreement includes more than 3,500 FIs currently using check-free from Fiserv for bill payment and will allow the solution to scale rapidly. Furthermore, in the near future, we will reach merchants directly with this product through Clover and our ISV channel. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I will cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our third quarter was very strong. We are confident in our new 2023 outlook and ability to continue to deliver attractive levels of growth and profitability. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and a solid recovery in growth in the Fintech segment. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Total company adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion grew 8% for the quarter despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind. Adjusted operating income grew 17% in the quarter to $1.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 38.1%, an increase of 290 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $13.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $4.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 36.1%, an increase of 250 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% to $1.96 compared to $1.63 in the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $5.34, at the high end of the 14% to 16% annual prior guidance range. Our adjusted earnings per share growth is particularly noteworthy given the impact of foreign currency translation. Mostly due to the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the dollar, our earnings per share includes a headwind of $0.24 for the quarter versus prior year. Free cash flow reached $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% versus the prior year and $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up 29%. We are raising our free cash flow guidance and now expect to reach $4 billion this year, reflecting the typical strength in our cash flow generation in the second half of the year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 20% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. We now anticipate organic revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year. Adjusted revenue growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth in this segment is running well ahead of our medium-term guidance for 9% to 12% growth, driven by growth in Clover, our ISV channel and our international businesses as well as several transitory factors that we expect will ease in future years. The elevated Argentine inflation, which is running well above 100% this year, contributed about 2 points of organic growth for the segment on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, high interest rates in Argentina have contributed to a stronger growth in anticipation revenue. But even as rates normalize, we expect demand for these prepayments to be healthy given the extended settlement periods here as well as in Brazil and Uruguay. Turning to volume performance in the quarter. Merchant volume grew 2% overall and 6% excluding wholesale processing. Similarly, transactions grew 1% overall and 9% excluding processing. Recall that a large portion of our volume comes from traditional wholesale processing. However, over the last several years, we\u2019ve been evolving from providing processing services alone to offering full acquiring services and more recently software and other value-added solutions. This transition changes our business model for the better. Our SMB and enterprise acquiring businesses carry much higher revenue per dollar volume compared to the wholesale processing business. So as acquiring grows and wholesale processing becomes a smaller portion of our volume, we are seeing a widening positive spread with revenue growth outpacing volume growth in large part due to value-added services. Going forward, processing volume will ebb and flow. As a reminder, we projected $10 billion of revenue in this Merchant Acceptance segment in 2025 with processing revenue roughly flat from 2021 to 2025. We expect overall revenue growth will continue to outpace volume growth as we increase penetration of software and services, which means more revenue per unit of volume. Clover continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering, distribution partnerships, expanded direct sales and value-added solutions. It posted a strong 26% revenue growth for the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $68 billion or $272 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 17%, over 2 points above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew 14% excluding the loss of a large merchant aggregator, as discussed last quarter. On an unadjusted basis, Carat revenue grew 2%. We had two large wins that included our Commerce Hub product, the new single orchestration layer that enables easy access to all our products and services. First with Curb Mobility, the taxi-hailing service; and second, with Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping system provider to small business. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 24% to $757 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 35.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 22% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 300 basis points to 33.8%. Turning to Slide 6, the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 5% and 8% year-to-date. Growth drivers in this segment include North American credit active accounts on file, though growth here slowed a bit to 3%. And Zelle transactions grew 44%, which continued to benefit from new uptake of Zelle for Business. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, added several new merchant customers, including some household names in e-commerce, in part to take advantage of Reg II benefits. These and prior new client adds represent a strong pipeline of prospects for the Merchant Acceptance business. We also won a deal to support Pinnacle, a $42 billion bank by assets, in a combined debit processing and network win, demonstrating our ability to successfully support and sell to larger banks. Outside the U.S., we closed a 5-year deal with a Tier 1 U.K. bank to support the launch of a new buy now, pay later solution to be delivered using a combination of our FirstVision processing technology and our new suite of digital solutions. We also won a contract with Bandhan Bank, India\u2019s eighth-largest bank, further cementing our position as a market leader in credit processing in India, bringing the number of Indian banks on our FirstVision processing platform to 10. As we\u2019ve said, we expected tougher comparisons through the second half of the year given the anniversary of the onboarding of several large clients through mid-2022. We continue to anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be toward the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 12% to $832 million and adjusted operating margin was up 270 basis points to 48.6% in the quarter, driven by favorable mix and greater productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 14% to $2.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 46.7%. Moving to Slide 7, the Financial Technology segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 4% and 1% year-to-date, impacted by the divestiture of our financial reconciliation product announced at the beginning of the quarter. For the year, we expect organic growth to reach the low end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter to $291 million and up 5% to $856 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 260 basis points to 36.7% for the quarter. For the first 9 months, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin grew 130 basis points to 36.1%. We added eight new core account processing clients in the quarter, including three wins with financial institutions whose assets exceeded $1 billion. Two wins came from growing credit unions, including Noble-Federal, that saw the benefits of upgrading to DNA, our industry-leading cloud-enabled core for both credit unions and banks. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $120 million in the quarter and $384 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2% and was 19.6% for the first 9 months. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.3 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped to 2.8x. During the third quarter, we issued $2 billion of 5-year and 10-year senior notes to replace the notes that matured in October and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 7% of total. During the quarter, we continued executing capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 9.6 million shares for $1.2 billion and 31.4 million shares for $3.7 billion over the last 9 months. We had 60.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth is at the top end of our prior guidance for the full year, and we expect the level of business activity in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. While consumer spending is forecast to be slower in the second half of the year relative to the first, the consumer has remained resilient and unemployment levels remain low. Bank and credit union IT spending continues at a healthy pace as higher interest rates have been a tailwind for profitability. The combined scenario gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. Based on this higher anticipated organic revenue growth and strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.40 to $7.50 to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin, now expected to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of at least 150 basis points. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 15. Space is limited, so for those of you who cannot attend in person, please take advantage of the webcast from our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our CSR activities and most recent recognitions before we wrap up and move to Q&A. During the quarter, we continued to expand our focus on minority depository institutions, or MDIs. In September, we hosted our inaugural MDI Advisory Council meeting, where we discussed future save products and strategies and how to better integrate Fiserv solutions at council members\u2019 banks to help them grow and better serve their clients. We were active on the back-to-business front as well. So far this year, Fiserv\u2019s back-to-business program has funded almost 200 grants totaling nearly $2 million for small, diverse merchant businesses. Also, in the third quarter, our leadership position in Fintech was affirmed when IDC ranked Fiserv number one on its top 100 ranking of global financial technology providers. CNBC also named us a top Fintech company. And Time Magazine included Fiserv on its list of World\u2019s Best Companies in 2023. I\u2019d like to conclude my formal remarks with what to expect from our upcoming investor conference on November 15. This will be our first full business review in 3 years. Our work to integrate First Data and Fiserv is not only done, but is driving real value in the marketplace across merchants and financial institutions in a way that only this combined company can. Our assets are now unmatched when you consider that we have a large and diverse client base from financial institutions of all sizes, to small businesses, to large enterprises around the world, spanning all sectors and containing many leaders in their respective industries; a global footprint in over 100 countries organized by region and known for deep local expertise; a modern stack computing environment with private and public cloud capability; scale-based leadership in merchant acquiring, driven in part by a superior distribution model; the largest SMB SaaS payment platform by volume with Clover; the leading credit card issuing platform offering cutting-edge cardholder experiences; the number three debit network; our NOW network that optimizes connections between our bank and credit union clients and payment rails of all types, from cards, to ACH, to real time; the best bank and credit union account processing platforms; and the broadest set of value-added surround solutions. And finally, cross-platform opportunities that expand our addressable market and that Fiserv is uniquely positioned to deliver. This includes our new SMB accounts payable and receivable market opportunity and our embedded finance offering, where our newest Fintech platform, Finxact, is enabling banking services offered by merchants, starting with one of the world\u2019s largest retailers. We\u2019ll expand on these opportunities and more in a few weeks\u2019 time, and we\u2019ll share a compelling 3-year forward plan that will help you understand how we intend to defend and extend our lead in Fintech. Thank you to our teams who come to work every day and build and deliver on this plan. And thank you all for your time and attention today. And now operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to touch on enterprise e-commerce competition, very topical in the market right now, and you mentioned many new Carat wins. Maybe you could talk a little bit about STAR and Accel and how bundling those networks is helping you to win share? But not just STAR and Accel, some of the other services that are more frequently appealing to the enterprise e-comm merchants as you win these RFPs, I would appreciate that. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Tim. Good to hear from you. I\u2019d start at the top, right? We committed to the build-out of our omni-channel capability and we brought in Commerce Hub as fundamentally a centerpiece of that. And that really gets to the point that you bring, which is what I would call more value-added services than just fee account volume. Our debit routing capability is very, very strong, and it allows us to, also with the debit network, to be able to give our clients the opportunity to work on lowering the cost of acceptance, a platform that we\u2019ve thought about across the business for a very long time. Created other value-added services, like our prepaid products and gift, also gives us what we believe is a strategic advantage. So in many of our businesses, you\u2019ll hear us talk about it across \u2013 we\u2019ll have the fundamental processing capability and acquiring capability, but then bringing across the other value-added services. And that\u2019s the benefit of this company, it gives us a strategic advantage. So I think about it in those aspects, really. And I think when you look at PayPal and the like, it gives us a really good hand to be able to do more with them besides only e-comm, and also for other clients, it\u2019s the omnichannel experience that we bring to them across the enterprise. Timothy Chiodo : Excellent. Thank you, Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good to see the acceleration in Clover revenue growth and the increased penetration of value-added services. Could you just drill down into what you see as the biggest drivers of growth in value-added services going forward, taking you to the model you\u2019ve laid out for 2025? Frank Bisignano : I mean, for us, it\u2019s software stacks against verticals, and then there\u2019s a horizontal capability. Obviously, employee management, everything from timekeeping systems to the way, in fact, they\u2019re managing their workforce is a capability that gets used horizontally. If you look at other pieces, it will be inventory for some specific businesses. And I think if you look at our penetration rate, it continues to grow because the bundles continue to get stickier. You heard us then today announce Melio \u2013 or yesterday announce Melio, I should say. And that will be another \u2013 it goes beyond Merchant, and we can talk about that later if you all like. But it will be in their offering to our merchant base in total, and that would be an example of bringing in capabilities that we didn\u2019t have for them before that we will. So I think we started \u2013 if you remember, we started Clover with the concept of an app store. We converted that into understanding what are the natural characteristics of specific verticals and then what is the horizontal capability that we will bring across it. And we feel good about the growth and we see the trajectory of both signing up new merchants and also the ability to bring more product to our current merchants. David Togut : And just as a quick follow-up. Bob, good to see the free cash flow up 48% year-over-year in the third quarter. CapEx was down 17%. Are we moving toward lower capital intensity going forward? Or is this just a function of an easy comparison? Robert Hau : Yes. I would definitely, David, point to really timing of the capital spending and comparisons. I would expect full year 2023 to be in line with last year\u2019s spending overall. And I think we\u2019ve said in the past, as we look forward, we think the capital levels that we\u2019ve got right now are about correct going forward. We\u2019ll see a growth in revenue, and therefore, as a percent of revenue, perhaps some easing. But order of magnitude, that $1.5 billion for the full year is right in line with what we\u2019d expect. David Togut : Thank you very much. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you. Great results here. On the Acceptance side in Lat Am specifically, I\u2019m curious with the anticipation revenue likely to ease there, and you gave some disclosure. I\u2019m just curious, what do you see replacing that growth in Lat Am? How does the deal pipeline look there? Robert Hau : Yes. Tien-Tsin, I think, we pointed out in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re definitely seeing some \"transitory benefits\" in Latin America, particularly in Argentina, around higher-than-normal inflation and higher-than-normal interest rates. That is definitely giving us a lift from an anticipation standpoint. I think we basically are anticipating cash into the merchant. We\u2019re in the middle of the payment flow. And so we\u2019re able to provide that as a service to our merchants so that they can settle their transactions earlier than the typical 30-day cycle in that region. Interest rates, we get a spread on the interest. And of course, we\u2019re able to borrow at a cheaper rate than our merchants might be able to borrow. So that\u2019s a good business for us, very low risk because we\u2019re in the middle of that flow. If you anticipate interest rates to ease into the future, which I would expect they will, you\u2019ll see some easing of the revenue, but not in the spread. And so it remains a very good business for us. And of course, the debate will be at what rate does either inflation and/or interest rates ease. An important element, though, is a very correlated number to both inflation and interest rates is FX. And while, from an organic standpoint, we don\u2019t have FX because our organic results are at constant currency, it\u2019s certainly in our adjusted revenue and our EPS. And so we\u2019ll see some easing of that transitory inflation and interest impact will also see some easing about FX impact, net-net. Overall results on an adjusted revenue basis and an adjusted EPS basis will remain strong. About Latin America, it\u2019s a tremendous franchise for us, not only in Argentina, but in Brazil. We continue to grow and expand in Uruguay and Mexico, in the Caribbean. It\u2019s a tremendous capability for us and providing a good growth in the recent history and expect it to continue into the future. Tien- Tsin Huang : Glad to hear, Bob. Just real quick, if you don\u2019t mind me asking another one just on Fintech. You mentioned medium bank \u2013 and overall bank spending has been healthy on the IT side. How about new deal activity, large deals, et cetera? Do you see that continuing here as we cross into the new calendar year? I\u2019m just curious where the appetite is for new spend in the banking community. Frank Bisignano : I think \u2013 yes. I think the dialogue is robust. I think Finxact has definitely added to that dialogue from where we were before. In my prepared remarks, I talk about our platform serving bank and credit union. I have a deep belief, and I think the market has a deep belief, that DNA and Finxact are industry leaders in capabilities. We had always talked about going further up market. Obviously, I think if you look at total banks that run on a system, we\u2019re the market leader. But we\u2019re also driving north and I think those two assets really help us. And there\u2019s lots of robust dialogue, now we need to turn the robust dialogue into closed deals and then we\u2019ve got to convert it. But I feel good about the long term. We\u2019ll talk about it clearly on November 15. I also think, when we look at FIs in total, which is the way ultimately we look at it, when you look at how we\u2019ve performed in Fintech and Payments, if you want to think about it that way, we\u2019ve been very, very strong. The ability to bring our surrounds, that\u2019s probably a year-to-date 7% number. We\u2019ve been able to bring our surrounds in our banking platforms, and that\u2019s really what attracts the new book, so to speak. So we\u2019re in deep dialogues on big deals. And I have not seen a slowdown in banks\u2019 appetite at all for the things we have. Tien- Tsin Huang : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. Thanks. So on the Acceptance segment, it doesn\u2019t sound like your Q4 guide is really contemplating any material change in the trajectory of overall consumer spending. I was hoping you could maybe give a little insight into what you\u2019ve seen in October, both with regard to volume and transaction data ex-wholesale versus September, let\u2019s say? And any shifts in discretionary versus nondiscretionary spend categories in the past month? Thanks. Robert Hau : Yes, Jason, overall, so far, what we\u2019ve seen in October is very similar to what we saw through the third quarter. Consumer continues to be quite resilient. Quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of using the word uncertain. We\u2019ve lived in a pretty uncertain environment for the last 3-plus years and probably a lot earlier than that. There are certainly some verticals within our overall merchant book that are softer than others. Roughly half of our merchant volume is \u2013 or merchant revenue is discretionary \u2013 in nondiscretionary, so we\u2019re nicely balanced there. We\u2019re certainly seeing some softness in retail. The restaurants continue to be quite steady. So overall, obviously, we\u2019re very early in the quarter. And as you know, holiday spending in December month is a big part of the quarter, but so far, right in line with what we saw in Q3. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Good to hear. And just on the Fintech segment, it looks like you need to see maybe a little bit of organic growth acceleration in Q4 against a bit of a tougher comp to get to the low end of that 4% to 6% guide. Can you just parse out some of the drivers there and your visibility on that? Robert Hau : Yes. I think in order to reach the low end of that guidance that we talked about, the low end of the 4% to 6%, we\u2019ve got to repeat the 6% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. To your point, yes, it\u2019s against a tougher comparison in Q4 versus Q3 of last year. Obviously, we\u2019ve got some implementations. These are long-cycle implementations. And as those go live, you get some ramp on that revenue, and that does take time. So some of it went live in Q3, and we\u2019ll see acceleration into Q4. We\u2019ll see new clients going live in Q4. Obviously, there\u2019s ongoing swings or variability in the periodic revenue in order to deliver that 4% on a full year basis. And I think as Frank pointed out, our financial institutions clients look to us for a broad suite of software and services, and the combined Fintech and Payments business, which is really where we go to market with our financial institution clients, is up 7% organically on a year-to-date basis. Pretty steady, stronger Q1, a good Q2, good Q3. We expect to close out the year at that rate, that level. And overall, financial institution clients continue to look to us to provide services, and anticipate that continuing in fourth quarter and into next year. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, great quarter. Congrats. I was particularly interested in the Melio partnership. Frank, can you maybe give us some more color, if you think like 2, 3 years out, how could this change the way people think of Fiserv in terms of kind of its B2B capability, Zelle, all the projects that you\u2019re hopefully planning to do with them? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m thinking if I necessarily want them to think about us change or think about this is who we are, the ability to distribute great capability to our outstanding client base. And I want to make the point that this product works really, really well with our bill pay CheckFree product and allows us to go to our SMBs exclusively in the FI channel with it, and allow our banks to actually, ultimately, have a new offering that will increase their fee revenue and in fact increase our revenue. So I think it\u2019s solidifying our position in SMB. Yes, it will also be distributed to our ISV clients and our Clover clients. But there are many clients that do not receive payments via card, and this is taking something to the whole swath of them that we did not have. You should expect us in market in the summer of \u201824 on it. And once again, we\u2019re helping our bank partners bring more product and grow their revenue, much like we do in the merchant business, and we\u2019re adding to the stickiness of our SMB portfolio. Dan Dolev : Great. Thank you, and congrats again on the amazing quarter. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Dan. Good to hear from you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : Yes. Hey, guys, great job. And maybe on just the merchant acquiring industry, there\u2019s been the fears of commoditization. But if anything, you\u2019ve shown the strongest growth in years, your yields have been going up, not down. But what about churn? Like have you seen noticeable improvement in churn or retention really over the last few quarters as well? Frank Bisignano : Yes. But I think it\u2019s good to step back for a second here because we\u2019ve been in a multiyear transformation that has allowed us to produce what we\u2019re producing today. That would include Clover. That will include building a business in Brazil. That will include bringing Clover to Argentina, right? So there\u2019s a lot of dimensions to how we are where we are. The ability to drive ARPU in our base, we get a wholesale processing business, which we talked about being $1 billion of revenue and flat, but that business is like 40% of our volume. In that core direct business that we continue to grow, you should continue us to bring more product in and just make those relationships stickier. And what we see is when we have 3 to 4 products in a client, the churn is best-in-class. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on ARPU and more clients. Yes, in single-dimensional clients that aren\u2019t Clover, you see higher churn. David Koning : Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up. What was the Q2 number for \u2013 with Q3, the volume ex processing of 6%. What was that number in Q2? Robert Hau : Dave, I actually don\u2019t have that right at my fingertips. It\u2019s not a number we\u2019ve disclosed previously. Let me get that. But I think one of the elements or one of the reasons we disclosed that and brought that to everybody this year \u2013 or excuse me, this quarter, is to talk about exactly what Frank just pointed out, is this long-term transition from years ago, being a processing-only business, to now a full service capability merchant acquirer. In our March 2022 investor conference on our Merchant business, we talked extensively about building out that Clover software value-added services capability, becoming an operating system. We have an operating system for SMB clients. We have an operating system for enterprise clients. And so as the processing eases a bit from a volume standpoint, the impact to the revenue is a fraction of the processing volume delta. And in many cases, that processing volume becomes merchant acquiring volume at a much better value point for the company because, not only are we doing merchant acquiring, but we\u2019re selling the value-added services. And that delta you saw in Q3 from an overall volume to essentially an enterprise plus SMB volume at 6% is more representative of the overall volume opportunity for the company. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a very strong organic growth rate in the Merchant segment this quarter, last quarter, last year, the previous year. David Koning : Yes. All good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the margin outperformance you guys are seeing. And taking a step back, thinking about it in terms of how much is driven by a better business mix, meaning more Clover software, Zelle, et cetera, versus sort of a more active expense management or expense control. And I\u2019m just asking in the context of thinking about how sustainable the margin drivers you\u2019re seeing this year may be kind of over time, if that makes sense. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I would say we\u2019re always working on how to make things better, right? That\u2019s just every day, we get up, how do we make it better? How do we make it better for our clients? How do we eliminate work that\u2019s not necessary? How do we deliver better quality? How do we do all that? And that\u2019s an element of it. The other element of it is high-quality revenue growth. And our incremental drop-through is very, very strong. So I would say investment, we\u2019ve been completely plowed into, meaning we\u2019re continuing to build our business and invest in our business and deploy resource to it. We have \u2013 we always are working on productivity and quality. We talk about a year of operational excellence. But our incremental drop-through rate is very, very strong on the business we have. So I would take it as a mix element. We\u2019re never going to be just one or the other. As I said in my remarks, we do have a lot of discretionary investment, but we feel great about that. And that\u2019s why the Melio product will be out in the summer of \u201824, as an example. So high-quality revenue, good incremental drop-through, continually driving better client stats and productivity. So it\u2019s got to be all of it. We don\u2019t do just one. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. So sort of all of the above. A quick follow-up for me. On the Acceptance volumes, how should we think about that wholesale part of the business evolving over time? Do you see kind of a point of stabilization coming? Or is this a business that we should sort of think of kind of winding down very gradually over a long period of time? Frank Bisignano : Well, first of all, we talked about it as flat, right? We talked about you should expect it to be fundamentally flat by $10 billion. Now that may mean less volume, even better yield in there, right? There\u2019s a big mix of what\u2019s in processing. We have an ISO business and we have a bank processing business. And by the way, tomorrow, we could bid on another piece of processing. I view it, as I\u2019ve always said, and maybe this is just my heritage and it won\u2019t ring with everybody, as running a correspondent clearing business and running a wholesale broker dealer. I\u2019m never going to get the correspondent clearing business to be a high growth, but it definitely is $1 billion for us that covers a lot of fixed. But our emphasis is on growing our direct business. So I\u2019ll turn over to Bob. And I want you to have that picture. We don\u2019t see it as zero, we said it\u2019d be flat in \u201825. Robert Hau : Ramsey, that flat that Frank is referring to is when we guided to $10 billion of merchant revenue by 2025. In what, 2 \u2013 almost 2 years ago now, we were doing about $900 million to $1 billion worth of processing revenue. Our $10 billion outlook assumed that, that would remain flat over that time period. There will be shifts to volume, you\u2019ll get a little bit of price, there will be adds, there will be deletes, there\u2019s some \u2013 I think I used the term ebbs and flows in the processing volume. But overall, I anticipate it to be about that $1 billion, which means it was, order of magnitude, 13%, 14% of our revenue. By 2025, it will end up being 10% of our revenue as we grow the full merchant acquiring capability and continue to grow that at a much faster pace than our processing. But that\u2019s a nice $1 billion revenue business for us that we\u2019re happy to have and we\u2019ll continue to manage that effectively. And then before we go to the next question, just going back to David, your question around the enterprise and SMB volume or volume ex processing, it is an acceleration. That 6% that we\u2019re seeing in Q3 is a bit of an acceleration from Q2 levels. So continue to see good growth, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the top line for us. We\u2019ll move to the next question. Operator : Yes, absolutely. And for our final question, we\u2019ll go to Vasu Govil from KBW. Please go ahead. Vasundhara Govil : Hi, thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the great quarter. I guess, my first one for Frank. Frank, CFPB just released these open banking regulation proposal. Assuming that goes into effect some time next year, is that a revenue opportunity for Fiserv as banks have to comply? Or do you think that was sort of already happened organically, and so not that meaningful... Frank Bisignano : I think it was really organically going on. I mean \u2013 but if you look at what we just did with Plaid, we\u2019re always going to veer in to bringing more capability to out bank partners. We\u2019re a client business. We run a huge client franchise. We\u2019re out talking to them every day, whether it was what we did at Forum with 3,000 clients, or what we do at [AGBA] or what we do by having 29 women CEOs here for an all-day conference, we want to listen to our clients. And so open banking has been going on, and we\u2019re continuing to align in a way that try our client for franchise. Vasundhara Govil : Great. And then quick one for you, Bob. Just I know last year, towards the end of the year, you guys had some pricing benefit that helped revenue growth. Just how should we think about the fourth quarter in terms of spreads versus volume growth in the Acceptance segment? Robert Hau : I think \u2013 yes, I think you\u2019ll continue to see good revenue growth as we continue to have deeper penetration of value-added services, not only in the small business, but also in the enterprise space. We\u2019ll continue to put up very good growth. And as we said, we expect the full year to be in the high teens. On a year-to-date basis, we\u2019re at 17% organic, so we see another strong quarter ahead of us. Vasundhara Govil : Thank you very much. Frank Bisignano : Thank you for your participation, everybody. We really appreciate your time and attention. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today\u2019s call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter and full year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another double-digit growth year for Fiserv in both organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In 2023, we continue to demonstrate our leadership as proven by our financial performance. 12% organic revenue growth, more than 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, $4 billion of free cash flow and $4.7 billion return to our shareholders through share repurchase. These results are possible because Fiserv possesses a set of assets that's unparalleled in our industry. From our vast and diverse client base, product portfolio and distribution network, to technology and capital resources, to a deep bench empowered with strategic vision and operational excellence. This combination of assets is how we plan to sustain strong performance. A fundamental aspect of our culture is that we are not satisfied and we continue to push for more. We know that great opportunity remains for continued revenue growth and improved productivity. We laid out several growth strategies at our investor conference in November and we are executing on those every day. At the same time, we continue to identify ways to drive further productivity. Five years ago, we announced the plan to merge First Data in Fiserv. Today, we are a 4.5 year-old company with a 38-year track record of double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Under our new structure, half of our company, Merchant Solutions, is a leader in the high growth payments market where SMBs and enterprises are embracing the benefits of an operating system with seamless integration of value-added solutions. The other half, financial solutions is a leader in the high recurring revenue financial IT software and services market, helping small and medium sized financial institutions level the playing field with larger banks and helping larger banks migrate to next generation technology. This combination of growth and consistency has served us well. And our business model is even more compelling at the intersection of these two businesses. We continue to see strong opportunity to cross sell and integrate merchant and financial solutions to help financial institutions better serve their merchant customers and enable merchants to retain customers with new financial services offerings. Fiserv is unique in its positioning at the center of these two important ecosystems. Let's take a step back and review our 2023 results. They highlight another important aspect of our culture, delivering on our commitments. In late 2020, we set formidable financial and operational targets for the subsequent three years. We delivered on those and more. For 2023, we started with organic revenue growth guidance of 7% to 9% and delivered 12%. We started with a goal of at least 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and delivered 220 basis points. And we started with adjusted EPS guidance of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12 to 14% growth. And we delivered $7.52 or 16% growth. In the fourth quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth of 12% and adjusted operating margin of 40.7% up 150 basis points from fourth quarter 2022, which itself was an exceptionally strong quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.19 was ahead of expectations on the strength of our merchant revenue and payments margin. Free cash flow was also very strong at $1.3 billion. And we repurchased 8.6 million shares, ending the year with 5% fewer average diluted shares outstanding than last year. Our Merchant Acceptance segment generated organic revenue growth of 24% and 19% in the quarter and full year, respectively, exceeding our expectations at the start of the year. Clover revenue growth accelerated 30% in the quarter as SMBs remained healthy and restaurants in particular continuing to outperform. Our distribution partners globally continued to embrace our platform. Value-added solutions revenue grew more than 40% in 2023 to end the year at a 19% penetration rate. Carat's revenue growth rebounded to 11% in the quarter or 15%, excluding the client that took processing in-house mid last year. Growth was driven by the ramp of recent wins by key clients, which has continued into this year. We expanded our global acquiring capability by adding India's UPI and Japan's JCB as payment methods for clients in more than 35 markets. In the energy sector, we complemented our leadership position with a new deal to provide seamless unattended payment experiences for drivers using one of the country's largest networks of charging stations. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to have signed several new deals in EMEA during Q4 and into January. They included a major new merchant acquiring relationship with a leading apparel and equipment retailer and a renewal and extension of business with a leading QSR. Additionally, our Vert joint venture with Deutsche Bank is now beginning to hit its stride with accelerated Clover merchant sign-ups. In Asia-Pac, we signed a new merchant acquiring deal with Vistara, a domestic airline in India and went live with more payout options for consumers in the region. In Latin America, we continue to ramp up merchant acquiring in Brazil for CaixaBank, along with payment acceptance at its BillPay outlets. We've laid the groundwork to support more fee-based PIX transactions for our merchant clients with the acquisition of SLED in Q4. SLED is a software solutions company that will allow Fiserv to operate as a direct payment service provider, expanding our reach into the full PIX instant payments universe. In April, we will be rolling out Clover, which we expect to further advance our leading position in Brazil. In Argentina, we're building on our 4-year Clover lead with acceleration in new merchant growth. With more Clover merchants engaging in more anticipation activity, our growth in Argentina continues beyond the macro factors of high inflation and interest rates. The payment segment achieved the top end of its medium-term guidance range with 4% organic revenue growth in the quarter and 8% for the year. We added nearly 20 large e-commerce merchants to our debit network, STAR and Accel, in the wake of Reg II, including eBay and HelloFresh in Q4 and Uber, Lyft and others earlier in the year. Several of these are new clients to Fiserv. In 2023, we signed well over 200 of our financial institution clients to our NOW Network to expand their payment routes to include FedNow for real-time payments. In BillPay, the bill and directory behind our market-leading consumer BillPay business is proving valuable in the SMB space as we complete the build-out of our new small business accounts receivable and payable offering, cash flow essential. We won our first client in the fourth quarter, Washington Federal Bank, with $23 billion in assets. And just last week, Fiserv expanded its long-standing digital money movement relationship with U.S. Bank to now include cash flow essential. These two important wins came just a few months after formally announcing the product. The pipeline is growing rapidly with strong interest and demand from financial institutions, including many of the largest. At our investor conference, we talked about value-added solutions and new verticals in our issuing business. We made significant progress on both during 2023 and early Q1. One of our value-added services, an AI-based fraud prevention tool called Advanced Defense, grew volume nearly 5x over 2022. Now, Synchrony is in the process of upgrading to Advanced Defense across its portfolio of more than 70 million accounts. We're excited to be rolling out the California Employment Development Department plan for our Money Network prepaid cards. This largest-of-its-kind state program for unemployment and other benefits will go live later this month. We have a pipeline of other opportunities in the government sector to deliver on our strategy to grow in this vertical. This also extends to healthcare, where we converted a significant portion of Health Equity's card portfolio onto our platform in the fourth quarter, with the remainder scheduled for later this year. In EMEA, we signed our first global OpenFX issuer deal with Absa, one of Africa's largest diversified financial services groups. This new currency solution enables issuers to take control of their FX, mitigate FX exposure and bring more value to their cardholders. With Truworths, one of the leading retailers in South Africa, we upgraded to a VisionPLUS license, attaching more value-added solutions. In Asia-Pac, we added a new India issuer processing client, Equitas Small Finance Bank. They will launch their retail and corporate card programs using our FirstVision India processing hub, with a full-stack offering that includes UPI, loyalty, offers, and real-time fraud management. The FinTech segment recorded a 1% decline in organic revenue for the quarter and a 2% increase for the full year. Organic growth excluding periodic revenue for the year was 4%. While we knew we had a very difficult comparison with high periodic revenue in Q4 '22, we had visibility to achieve our growth goal. In large part from the level of client engagement we saw at Forum, our client conference in June. And those discussions continued. Separately, the pace of new core wins remains healthy at 12 in Q4, and clients are demonstrating two important trends. First, they are migrating from one Fiserv core operating system to another. A positive sign that they are finding the answers to their changing needs right here within the Fiserv portfolio. Second, while M&A activity among financial institutions slowed in 2023, we believe that M&A activity is good for us, as we can compete at any level with any institution without platforms and it creates an opportunity to provide more services to the combined institution. Prosperity Bank, a Texas-based regional bank with $38.5 billion in assets, decided in Q4 to migrate to our cloud-enabled DNA platform and signed up for our CardHub value-added solution. Old National Bank, a $49 billion bank in Indiana, is a core system client that has been growing with us as it has been making acquisitions. And we continue to grow our relationship with Old National in the fourth quarter with the addition of debit processing, Accel, CardHub, and other value-added solutions. These are also two examples of our financial technology segment clients buying our value-added solutions in the payment segment. This ongoing trend of clients buying services across these two segments is a key reason why we are creating a single new segment, Financial Solutions. Turning to the outlook for 2024, we expect total company organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, inclusive of an estimated 7 points of growth from excess revenue in Argentina, driven by significantly higher inflation and interest in the Argentina merchant business, following the government's steep peso devaluation in mid-December. We expect continued margin improvement in 2024 with at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. And adjusted earnings per share should grow 14% to 16%, reaching $8.55 to $8.70. This adjusted EPS growth outlook is in the middle of the range we provided at our investor conference in November, and it's meant to be a prudent reflection of the macroeconomic outlook. Economist consensus calls for U.S. personal consumption growth and consumer savings to be lower in 2024, creating a modest headwind to the merchant business. Against a potentially softer backdrop, we remain confident in our ability to grow Clover and Carat as we add more merchants, sell more to existing clients and add to our portfolio and penetration of value-added solutions. Our discussions with banks and credit unions indicate that they remain poised to spend to retain and grow deposits. We are meeting their changing needs every day with our operating system approach that offers the most integrated platforms and broadest suite of value-added solutions in the business. We are encouraged by our newest financial solutions initiatives in SMB payments with Cashflow Central, our new integrated digital banking platform experience digital and the power of Finxact to win over larger banks and existing clients. We expect all of these to ramp over the course of 2024 and set the stage for stronger growth in subsequent years. To summarize, our outlook for 2024 is positive as we anticipate another year of double-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share as well as strong adjusted operating margin expansion. Our optimism for sustained growth level is tempered only by the economic backdrop of modestly slower GDP growth and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in our ability to control our growth trajectory at the top and bottom lines through our strong positioning, innovation, good stewardship of capital and plain hard work. We rely on our resilient business model with its diverse client mix serving non-discretionary spending categories and our high recurring revenue to continue investing at a pace that supports our competitive strengths. For more details on our financial results, I'll pass the discussion on to Bob. Robert Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I'll additional cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum across the business. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in our Merchant Acceptance and payments and network segments, offset by a decline in the Fintech segment against a very difficult compare. For the full year, total company organic revenue also grew 12% ahead of the guidance we provided in October and November. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.6 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $1.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 40.7%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 260 basis points. The 40.7% represents a post-merger high for Fiserv. Our fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 37.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 compared to $1.91 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $7.52. Those adjusted EPS results do not include $0.12 per share in expense relating to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso as part of the government reform package on December 12 last year. This one-day move led to a non-operating, non-cash foreign exchange loss for the revaluation of our local balance sheet as required under GAAP rules for hyperinflation accounting. All other Argentine foreign exchange losses throughout 2023 are included in the adjusted EPS results. Free cash flow came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the full year, an increase of 14% over last year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 24% in the quarter and 19% for the full year, well ahead of our previous medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. This includes an 8 point benefit to the full year organic growth from the transitory revenue driven by above-average interest and inflation in Argentina. Adjusted revenue growth was 14% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. You can see from the spread between organic and adjusted revenue growth that currency headwinds from the devaluation of the Argentine peso offset the benefit of the country's very high inflation and interest for the full year in adjusted revenue. Global merchant volume and transactions in the quarter grew 5% and 8%, excluding wholesale processing respectively. Clover revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. The spread between revenue and volume growth comes from higher penetration of value-added solutions, channel mix shifts and some pricing. VAS penetration reached 19% in Q4, up from 16% in the year-ago period and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 11%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 9%, excluding the loss of a Latin American processing client that moved in-house. Revenue growth was 15% for both the quarter and the year. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 26% to $819 million in the quarter, with margin up 400 basis points to 38.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 23% to $2.9 billion and margin grew 330 basis points to 35.1%. Over the last couple of quarters, some of you have noted that our revenue includes anticipation in LatAm, but the cost of that anticipation interest is not included in operating margin, as it is reported as interest expense below the operating income line on the income statement. If we were to take that interest from anticipation and pro forma it back to operating income, merchant margins would still have expanded a very strong 220 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points for the year. Looking at 2024, January's overall volume growth, excluding processing, was similar to December's pace. Difficult weather throughout large portions of the U.S. did slow volume growth for a 2-week period in mid-January, but we've seen clear improvement in volume growth since then. The Fiserv Small Business Index also points to steady spending and a healthy environment for small businesses in January. We reported the index on February 2, with a value of 138, representing year-over-year growth of 1.7% and one-tenth of 1% growth from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. The Fiserv Small Business Index measures U.S. small business activity and is not a direct indicator of Fiserv results, but rather a measure of general pace of activity and health of this key Fiserv client base. Turning to Slide 7, on the payments and network segment. Organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. We have well over 200 financial institutions live or implementing FedNow and saw continued strength in Zelle, with transactions and number of clients growing at 44% and 23%, respectively for the quarter. Full-year organic revenue growth of 8% was at the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $877 million and margin was up 250 basis points to 51%, driven by operating leverage and some third-party productivity we had been working on throughout the year that came in through the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 13% to $3.2 billion and margin expanded 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moving to Slide 8, in the financial technology segment. We posted a 1% organic revenue decline for the quarter and 2% growth for the full year. Organic revenue, excluding periodic revenue, grew 4% for the full year, and client momentum continued with 12 core wins in the quarter, reaching 42 wins for the year. We had expected some strong license sales in the quarter to reach the bottom end of our full-year guidance, but in several cases, these did not materialize as clients instead chose our application service provider, or ASP model. This is where we host the software in our data centers instead of clients purchasing their own software licenses. It had the effect of lowering in-quarter revenue in Q4 and instead spreading it out as monthly payments over multiple years. Adjusted operating income was down 11% in the quarter to $303 million and flat at $1.2 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 340 basis points to 37.9% in the quarter. Full-year margin increased 10 basis points to 36.6% with the lower periodic revenue. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $110 million in the quarter and $494 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.7% and was 19.3% for the year. We expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.1 billion on December 31st. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another tenth of a turn to 2.7 times within our target leverage range. We have approximately 10% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $1 billion, bringing our total 2023 share repurchase to $4.7 billion and nearly $10 billion in the last three years. The diluted average share count fell 5% from 2022 levels. We have 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our longstanding capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. Turning to Slide 9. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, with adjusted operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.55 to $8.70 or 14% to 16% growth over 2023 and would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In Merchant Solutions, we anticipate organic revenue growth in the 25% to 28% range, including 14 percentage points of transitory revenue growth in Argentina. This is higher than the outlook given at our investor conference in November due to the effects of the steep devaluation of the Argentine peso mid-December. For Financial Solutions, we continue to expect 5% to 7% organic revenue growth this year. We continue to estimate approximately $4.5 billion of free cash flow for 2024. In the second half of 2023, we launched a new initiative to purchase green tax credits where we buy tax credits at a discount from companies who earned but cannot use them. This reduces the net cash tax paid and in many cases defers the cash payment by a quarter or two. A recent new rule codified this practice for 10 years, so we expect to continue to benefit from it. This will bring more variability to our quarterly cash flows. In 2024, there will be a headwind in the first quarter and first half when we paid for the credits and a tailwind in the second half when some of the tax refunds are received. While we do anticipate some shifts in timing, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting Fiserv's commitment to corporate social responsibility, which we align with business operations and employee engagement to maximize impact. Our next CSR report will be published in the second quarter and will demonstrate continued development of our employee resource groups, the Fiserv Cares Foundation, and our back-to-business program that awards grants to small businesses. To better serve our minority depository institution clients and their communities, we formed an MDI Advisory Council, which includes eight clients and other members. The council in part of our efforts to better collaborate and deliver value through our MDI clients and the communities they serve. Institutional Investor recognized Fiserv for its CSR efforts as the top ESG performer in the payments, processing and IT services sector, a first for the company. Our programmatic efforts earned recognition from prestigious indices like Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Equality Index. We also ranked number 1 on the Military Times Best for Vets Employers list. And just last week, we were named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 2024, marking the 9th time in 10 years that we received this honorable distinction. While we scored highly in many categories, among the highest was innovation. We are particularly proud of this category recognition as well as other standouts for people leadership, product and service quality, global competitiveness and long-term investment value. As we look ahead to what's coming in 2024, the ongoing advancement of AI is not driven solely by the expanding capabilities of technology but also by the underlying proliferation of data to feed that generative engine. For Fiserv, our data and AI-powered intelligence put us on a path to be an effective user and enabler of AI. We're in the early innings of using it to optimize our own operations and deliver actionable insights for our clients as well with significant benefits to come in quality, productivity and growth. Fiserv already manages one of the most valuable information stores in the industry and we start from a position of strength based simply on the sheer amount of data that runs through our systems each year. Over $4 trillion of payment volume globally across more than six million merchant locations, plus 1.6 billion card accounts on file, 325 million deposit loan accounts and 20 million BillPay users across nearly 10,000 financial institutions. The power of our data fueling AI applications is already helping us throughout our business in areas such as enhanced customer service, analytics on the Clover and Carat dashboards and fraud mitigation tools. Let me share with you three ways we are turning data into an increasingly potent AI asset. First, we're creating better service and insights for our clients by helping them harness data in actionable ways. As an example, 85% of technical service calls were resolved unassisted through the use of data and AI with high client satisfaction rates. Additionally, over the last year, more than two million of the highest-level technical support inquiries resolved online through AI assisted learning. Second, we're embedding our data and AI capabilities into value-added solutions such as Advance Defense being used to combat fraud and other security risks. And third, we're packaging our rich data assets to build next-gen products. Earlier this year, for instance, we launched the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real-time assessment of consumer spending at SMBs published monthly, enabling new valuable insights for financial institutions, policymakers, investors and businesses of all sizes. Bob discussed, the results of our January index, which we released on February 2, making it an extremely timely measure of the current environment. As Bob and I like to say, intellectual honesty with analytical rigor is, how we run the company. Data is the enabler for us to apply this in all that we do, serving our clients, choosing our partners, assessing our competition, prioritizing our investments, understanding our performance, and communicating it to investors. With the many assets, I discussed on this call, including our data, along with our dedicated associates worldwide, adopting as fundamental practice of intellectual honesty with analytical rigor, I'm confident that Fiserv will continue to extend its reach, and sustain our leadership through 2024 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the continued acceleration of Clover growth. I'll ask my question in the follow-up, both upfront. So first is a 4 PPT increase in the organic revenue growth guide for 2024, it looks like about three points of that relate specifically to an increase in Argentina inflation. So if that's correct, could you walk through how your operating organic revenue growth assumptions, have changed by segment versus the initial guide - at the November Investor Day? Thanks. Robert Hau : Yes, David, good morning. And your assessment is right on the mark. The total company organic revenue growth went up from back in November. We said 11% to 13%. We now expect 15% to 17%. We previously indicated the impact, the favorable impact of higher than normal interest and inflation in Argentina, would drive about six points of growth, to the Merchant segment, or about three points to the total company. We now expect that excess inflation and interest, is about seven points of growth, to the total company. So essentially, the growth - the increase in organic revenue growth, is really attributed, to higher inflation and interest expense, out of Argentina. The underlying, \"more normal organic growth\" of the Merchant segment and of the company remain consistent with what we expected and saw back in November. The other element, of course, as we talked about in November is, there is a natural counterbalance in our adjusted revenue, and in our income statement that higher excess inflation and interest rate, also drives a higher currency variation, or FX headwind. And that also increased about four points from the November. So net, our adjusted revenue, our EPS, our operating margins, very consistent, isolating out just that Argentina impact. David Togut : Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up. What are your expectations for Clover revenue growth in 2024? Would you expect continued acceleration? And then if so, any call-outs? I know, Frank, you mentioned Brazil rollout in April? Robert Hau : Yes. From a Clover standpoint, you saw the acceleration of revenue in the fourth quarter to 30%. We've talked quite a bit about the Clover growth rate, accelerating into our Investor Day commitment. Actually, both back in our March of 2022 call-out where we really focused in on Clover overall, where we gave an outlook to 2025. We updated that back in November to 2026. So adding another year of our outlook, we continue to believe, obviously, that we'll deliver against that $10 billion for the total company and $3.5 billion for Clover in 2025. And then $4.5 billion for Clover in 2026. We feel good about the trajectory. I wouldn't suggest that we're going to get 30% every single quarter, but there's a lot of elements that are driving that growth, and we feel good about the overall trajectory. Frank Bisignano : I would just say, we talked about Brazil. We've worked on that for a long time. You should expect us, to have further country rollouts. You heard us talk about - the Deutsche Bank JV Vert, which has begun to hit some strides and getting traction. You've always heard us talk about beginning to proliferate the ISV channel, and that fundamentally, there was nothing about our back book in that set of numbers, either of course we have done natural 90% new ad and some back book that just converts centrally. And I also would highlight the pen rate, is the number we talked about. We definitely were about growing ARPU, and you see that pen rate up at 19%, which kind of tracks exactly we'll be laying out to the path we believe we're on. So Clover continues to do its job. The distribution networks we have are unparalleled, and we're bringing more function into it, and more geography into it so David. David Togut : Thanks so much. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks. Wanted to follow-on with David's question just on the merchant side with volume and transaction growth. The spread there is really still quite favorable, both total and with Clover. So looking out, should we expect some kind of cyclical mean reversion with that, tightening plus under this value-added services promotions, and you mentioned pricing as well. So, what can we assume there since we're all trying to do the benchmarking exercise? Thanks. Robert Hau : Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think certainly, we've continued to see that spread, between volume and revenue, and it's something that is actually part of our strategic plan to grow to that $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in Clover and $10 billion to $12 billion for merchant by '25 and '26. I think ultimately what it comes down to is, as we continue to sell more software, more value-added services more additional capabilities, to our merchants. You're going to see revenue grow faster than volume. The spread will ebb and flow across different quarters, but we continue to see good opportunity to sell value-added services. That penetration reached 19% in the quarter, up about three, four points from a year ago, as we march towards the 27% by 2026. You'll continue to see great revenue growth overall. And certainly, there's the channel mix, more direct and ISV relative to where we are today, and that will continue to benefit that. Tien- Tsin Huang : Right, right more retail stuff, that's good. Glad to hear revenue faster than volume. Just my quick follow-up, then just I mean Frank and Bob you both talked about a lot of good wins, across all the lines here. Just thinking about the outlook for new deal activity in 2024, should we expect, or do you see a lot of large deals, or is it more of a cross-selling wins with some of the new products? What do you see for this coming year here? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Well I mean, I think it's all of the above. I mean, I suppose you might be also referring to those CashFlow Central wins we talked about, new product rollout, tremendous opportunity there. It's another area where we're helping out banks generate revenue, deliver better technology products, to their client base. And then we also believe that we have a lot of cross-sell opportunity, but we have a very large pipeline of just play on new wins. And you should expect us, to continue doing what we've been doing. And our expectation is we'll always do more. Robert Hau : And Tien-Tsin, the term cross-sell, is obviously something we use internally quite a bit. We talked to you folks about, ultimately, we have a very wide swath of clients. The U.S. bank deal that we announced this morning on CashFlow Central, that's a big transaction with a large bank, but it's a cross-sell. They are a large client of ours. They currently use CheckFree for their consumers. They'll now expand to CashFlow Central, for their businesses and merchants. And so, we'll continue to see lots of opportunities. It'll sometimes be, \"new logos\", but also selling additional capabilities to our existing client base. Tien- Tsin Huang : Good, good, Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Guys, thanks. It's great to see the merchant strength. I do want to touch on a couple of the other segments real quickly. And on the Fintech side, just to start, I know you expected tough comps, and you obviously called out the software license sales, to the ASP side impacting revenues. When we think about, what that means in terms of spreading out revenues, across a period of time now, in terms of more recurring revenues, maybe just help us understand your anticipation, for that segment again. I know you had initially raised the combined Payments in Fintech outlook a little bit when you had your Investor Day. So is that still on track? And if you could just revisit the drivers giving you confidence, really in both segments. Robert Hau : Yes, Darrin, good morning. So a couple of things. One, when we sign a license deal, typically that's a three or five-year license. You get a large license transaction. December is always a pretty high month for license activity, and you get ongoing maintenance, but license is certainly the big chunk. When you convert, or when a client instead goes to an ASP contract, you book that over the five-year period every single month. On a per account basis, or per transaction per user basis, depending on the product, and depending on the client contracting. We feel good. Ultimately, that's actually a better economic transaction for us. So, we like that transition. If you look at 2023's results and you combine the two bank and credit union facing segments, Fintech and payments and network, we did about 6% organic growth on a combined basis. If you look at our outlook for 2024, we reiterated what we said back in November. We expect that combined segment or the new segment financial solutions, which is largely a combination of the existing Fintech and payment, to be in that 5% to 7% range. And actually accelerate into 2025 and beyond up to 6% to 8%. So feel good about the overall growth of that business. The product portfolio, adding things like CashFlow Central, selling more payment solutions, benefits of Fintech as that goes live and gets deeper into the marketplace. We feel good about overall, our ability to continue to grow our capability selling into the banks and credit unions. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up on the merchant side again. Frank, you've talked a lot about the VAS side having a big penetration opportunity up to the mid-20% plus range. I think you had a nice jump this quarter. So, maybe just touch on what drove that, combined with - if you think you have the right assets now, or there's a lot more chatter over potential for tuck-in's and M&A again this year as rates may change. So anything on the horizon for you guys? Thanks guys. Frank Bisignano : Yes. I mean, we really do like our hands across the Board in the company. You've seen us add things like Fintech, which I think really compliments our ability to compete anywhere, anyhow, along with DNA, which has really proved itself. If you go to a merchant business, we're still largely focused on building out more verticals. That would be retail and services and continuing to complement, what we're doing in Bento. I think - our software stack is strong and we're continuing to add functionality to it. We think our pen rate will continue, to do what we've forecasted. Obviously, we're always looking at opportunities to invest, as a minority investor and you've seen us do that and things like Bento and Fintech and others. Ondot, which ended up being in more than a thousand institutions, tagged to our mobility product to - give an unbelievable experience to a thousand banks. So I think we feel good about our hand. We're always looking at can we add software functionality, and you should expect us to continue, to be great stewards of capital deployment, as I hope you all feel we have been. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line from Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Thanks a lot for taking the question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit of channel mix shift for Clover. I was hoping you could provide some directional color broad strokes across the 2023 cohort, of new merchants, or volume that came on to Clover, whether it be just kind of order of magnitude across direct sales, bank partners, whether they be JV or non-JV. And then of course, wholesale and retail ISO. And I ask partially, because clearly the differentiation, is partially due to the distribution here, but also so that we could get a better sense, on the portion of revenues that are, hitting adjusted revenue versus, maybe being netted out, or coming below the line in the equity income line? Robert Hau : Yes, I think we tried to give pretty significant transparency around, the last part of that question with \"excess inflation\" in interest on in Argentina. Just as a side note, our LatAm business in Argentina business is a great business. Obviously, we've got this variation going on, on the \"excess\", but that's a tremendous business. LatAm overall growth in Clover as we bring Clover down to Brazil. We'll add Mexico later in the year. So, we feel very good about our overall capabilities there. To the first part of the question, I would say broadly we continue to expand our distribution capabilities. We have a long track record of ISO and ISV partners, bank channel partners. We have traditionally not had a big direct business. That continues to grow, but we also continue to grow pretty meaningfully in the ISV channels - with expansion of ISV capability into Clover. And having that Clover asset makes us a pretty significant partner of choice, not only for ISVs, but also the bank channels. We see growth there. As a percent of growth, our direct business, is probably growing the fastest, but a little bit of it's the smallest piece. It's the newest piece of the organization, but we're seeing good growth across the board. Timothy Chiodo : Excellent. Thank you for that. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hi, guys. Great results here. My quick first question is on, again, back to the value-added services. Really impressive 40% growth. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the split in '23 between software and capital? Robert Hau : You're asking about 2023? Dan Dolev : Yes, the 40% growth that you mentioned in '23. Robert Hau : So, I wouldn't necessarily have a split for you in my fingertips. So, we can look to get that for you. And I think - I would tell you that it's been pretty consistent. Obviously, we always have a relatively large software capital software spending, given the nature of our business, and I think that remains relatively consistent. Frank Bisignano : Dan, were you asking, if you look at the 40%, what component was largely software and what component was Clover capital? Was that the question you're asking? Dan Dolev : Yes, exactly on the value-added service. Frank Bisignano : It's software dominated. I mean it would be, I'd call it, large majority software. Robert Hau : Sorry, I heard CapEx spending. Dan Dolev : Oh, I'm sorry, yes, it's my Israeli accent. Frank Bisignano : That's okay. Dan Dolev : No, it's really excellent. Frank Bisignano : That's why we got four years here. Dan Dolev : And then just my quick follow-up, really impressed by the opportunities in Reg II. I mean, one of the networks commented that this was drag. I would imagine this is a big benefit for Fiserv. Can you maybe talk about the size the opportunity here for STAR and Accel? Frank Bisignano : Well, as I continue to say, we have been committed to debit network, STAR and Accel, their strategic assets within the company. As Reg II turns into reality. You've heard us talk about nearly 20 wins. Obviously, we compete at every level. There's fabulous competition out there for these transactions. But embedded in what we're looking at is, obviously more opportunity than we had before Reg II and the fact that some of those household names that, you heard like HelloFresh or Lyft, or others give us that opportunity. So, I think it's off to a decent start. It remains to be determined over the longer haul, but we feel good about the Reg II opportunity. Dan Dolev : Amazing. Thank you so much. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the Fintech segment and the dynamic you saw there, where you switched kind of from the - or the clients wanted to switch kind of from the license model to more the recurring ASP model. Do you see this as kind of a one-off development with a handful of clients? Is this a broader trend? Just anything you can give us maybe around where that segment sits now in terms of percentage of revenue that's kind of more periodic versus recurring and what you're projecting on that front going forward? Frank Bisignano : Yes. I think there's a series of factors. I'd go back on the full year 4%, with non-periodic revenue. And clearly, we ultimately sign a number of transactions, but they became ASP instead of license, which we thought we had visibility license. We also like to remind everybody that fourth quarter historically, is where fourth quarter in the last month is where these things happen and going down to the wire. Like it wouldn't any software sales, as I know, having been a large buyer of software for years and jobs I have done. So, I think that - it's not necessarily a trend, but it does have clients, and we saw it last year, too, in different ways. Clients who believe that given regulatory, given cyber, giving a series of factors. The ASP model will help their P&L, and their ability to perform better than the license would have. I think it's an institution-by-institution choice. It's not the first time we've seen it. And I think a lot remains to be determined. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Good color. Just on a separate note, we saw last month, Fiserv applied for a bank charter in Georgia. Can you just talk about the steps, potential time line to get that application approved, what the benefit to Fiserv would potentially be, whether that's on the cost side, or ability to provide additional solutions to merchants? Thanks. Frank Bisignano : Well, yes, let me bring pure clarity to what that is, because there's clearly lots of questions about why Fiserv is applying for a bank license. And obviously, before we did that, we talked to the ABA, we communicate to our clients. It's a very specific purpose license that allows for sponsorship of merchant acquiring. Historically, you needed a bank and that's within the Visa and MasterCard rules. And our ability to be able to have an institution for that sole purpose that will allow us, to be a sponsor for our own merchant acquiring in certain instances, will be valuable as we can control more of the outcome than we could before. Very specific purpose very clear to our banks. We're not competing with them. We have great bank partners, as you know, probably the largest bank portfolio in the world. When you take merchant business and all our other businesses, and where our business to help our banks grow. This ultimately supports our smaller banks, who do not have sponsorship and we can bring it. It became more, clear in the merger when we were able to cross-sell, to our community banks and others, which we would have not have that First Data that our ability them ourselves would be very valuable. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : Yes. Hi, guys. Great year. And I guess my question on merchant. So you guided 25% to 28% organic. And then you talked about 14% benefit from FX and inflation. So, you're down to a core of kind of 11% to 14%, do both North America and international grow in that range, which presumably is taking quite a bit of share? Robert Hau : Yes. So the merchant business overall, obviously, good growth. Our international regions Europe, Latin America, APAC, all growing very nicely. EMEA larger than Latin America, growing a bit slower from an organic standpoint. Broadly our North American business, very high single-digit growth rate. And obviously, the international business is growing meaningfully higher than that given the size of the business and the opportunity to continue to grow and add merchants and sell more services there also. But good business, most definitely in all four regions. David Koning : Got you. And just a quick follow-up. FX losses, will you not add those back again through 2024? I know Q4 seems like the anomaly, you won't add those back. And maybe how big do you expect that to be an interest expense in 2024? Robert Hau : Yes. So let me be - make sure we're clear. What we adjusted out was actually not fourth quarter, not December, it was December 12. It was the one day devaluation that the new President of Argentina, put into place to a - little more than a 50% deval, and it was only the impact of revaluing the balance sheet, which in most currencies stays on the balance sheet. But because Argentina is hyperinflation, or highly inflationary, the accounting rules require you to revalue the balance sheet through the income statement. We did that every day of 2022. We did it every day of 2023, with the exception of the one-time significant transact, or significant move that, we felt was really non-normal course, non-operational. So, we dialed that piece out only. All of the other 364 days went through the income statement. And in fact, were larger than what we took in that one day. We have that that will occur in 2024. Obviously, if there's other - another significant deval, we may evaluate that. We're not anticipating that. We think things are \"more stabilizing\" in Argentina remains to be seen. It's a unique economy. We've got some great leadership down there, that are running our Latin America business that have been through these cycles multiple times, over decades of leadership. So, we feel very good about being able to handle, the kind of ongoing normal things. This one-time one-day deval is what we dialed out. David Koning : Got you. Thanks, guys. Great job. Robert Hau : Thank you. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi Frank, hi Bob. I guess my question is, with regards to the cadence of segment revenues and segment margins, what should we expect through the year? Because there are, I think, a couple of factors at least with regards to how, I guess, Argentina impact plays out? Does it reduce through the course of the year? And then Carat, I would imagine, much better back half of the year, because the lack of comp, tough comp, factors like that. I mean, how should we think of cadence through the course of the year? Robert Hau : Yes. I think, first off, broadly, across the company. I don't see a big variation from quarter-to-quarter or first half to second half. There are obviously some specific comparisons within individual segments, or individual margins. But broadly, generally in line across the board with the one nuance in our merchant acceptance business. I would expect organic revenue, to be higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Because we do anticipate, some improvement in interest rates and inflation in the second half relative, to what's going on there, as the economy deals with some of the things that the government is putting in place hopefully with their expectation that, they ease inflation and interest rates remains to be seen. But of course, that's offset by FX. So on an adjusted revenue basis, from a margin standpoint and EPS, relatively stable. The other thing I would just reiterate, we talked a bit about it in our prepared remarks. Cash flow will definitely have some variation with tailwinds in the second half of the year after some headwinds in the first half. But again, we have a good degree of confidence in the $4.5 billion for the full year. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then the quick follow-up is Fiserv's small business index, I guess, how indicative is it, of the health of Fiserv's own client base? And can you comment, generally speaking, on small business health? It seemed to me like your economic assumptions call for more or less a soft landing, but I just want to clarify. Robert Hau : Yes. First off, the latter part, yes, I would agree. We are anticipating, I think, like the rest of the world at this point, a soft landing things seem to be on track for that. A bit softer macro environment, modestly slower GDP in 2024. The FSBI is based upon a very broad set of data that we have across our company that we then extrapolate to the entire U.S. market. So, it is not a direct indication of Fiserv activity. If there are differences in region mix of - we're very strong in restaurant. We might have more restaurants than, we do nail salons, or so we go through the NAICS codes across the country, different industry weightings, different regions. When we take our data and extrapolate it, across the U.S. So it's very much a very real-time indicator of the health of small businesses. Now relative to our performance, we're the largest merchant acquirer in the country. So, if there's variation in the FSBI, you're likely to see variation in Fiserv's results relative to some nuances of different regions, industry weightings, et cetera. But certainly, a strong FSBI indicator index would be good for us, a weaker index would be a headwind for us. We're actually quite proud of that capability not only is it using all of the data we have, by the way, including cash transactions, which obviously, don't manifest themselves in our numbers for merchant acquiring, but we have the data, and it's very real time. We're able to provide that information two days after the month ends. It's not a perfect proxy, but it's a proxy. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you for all the information. Robert Hau : Thanks. Frank Bisignano : Well, thank you, everyone, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to IR team with any questions. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. As a reminder starting in the first quarter of this year Fiserv now reports two segments : merchant solution and financial solution to align with how we serve our clients. Please see our current reports on the Form 8-K filed on March 26 2024, for an explanation of the new segments and a recaps of 2022 and 2023 into the new segments. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results and a strong start to the year. Fiserv delivered a strong first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.88, up 19%, which reflects our continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin of 35.8% increased 180 basis points. We had organic revenue growth of 20% in the first quarter. This is consistent with our expectation of higher growth in the first-half of 2024 toward our full-year outlook of 15% to 17% organic growth. This healthy top line growth coupled with Q1 stronger margin performance leads us to raise our adjusted earnings for share outlook to a range of $8.60 to $8.75. From the prior range of $8.55 to $8.70, which is 14% to 16% growth. We now expect adjusted operating margin to expand at least 125 basis points this year, compared to our prior outlook for at least 100 basis points of margin improvement. As you know, beginning this quarter, we realigned our business to best reflect our clients engage with our solutions today. This client-centric model is now reported in two segments, with roughly half of our business in the merchant solution segment and the other half in the financial solution segment. Through this change, we retain our fundamental approach of providing business operating systems to run our clients\u2019 key processes, while delivering a variety of value added solutions for enhanced capability. Our business model combines the recurring revenue and high incremental margin of a scaled processing business with higher growth and higher margins, but still consistent cloud-based software and services offerings. Both our segments performed well and within our expectations. Merchant Solutions organic revenue grew 36% in Q1 and 13% on an adjusted basis. Financial Solutions revenue grew 5% organically and 2% on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects a solid macro environment, along with our ability to drive outperformance by adding new clients, retaining and growing with existing clients, and providing them more value-added solutions. At a Macro level, consumer spending remains resilient. The Fiserv Small Business Index, based upon the spending activity at 2 million small merchants in the U.S., shows spending rose 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 2.5% in Q4. The early read on April is that growth is tracking slightly ahead of the Q1 average. The index also showed that roughly 60% of Q1 spend was on non-discretionary categories. And the remaining spend went mostly to dining out, amusement, hotels, and short-term rentals. These metrics point to a resilient consumer in the U.S. turning to the broader environment for banking, while there is some signs of pressure our net interest income given high interest rates and potentially tighter lending. We have not seen this having an impact on our client's IT spending for the essential services we provide. With that macro backdrop, there are a number of highlights for Fiserv\u2019s business in Q1 and the remainder of the year. In Merchant Solutions, first quarter activity reinforced our progress toward achieving the targets we set in our November Investor Day, including to reach $12 billion in revenue in 2026 as we continue to expand adjusted operating margin. Let's discuss five of the drivers that support this outlook. First, Clover continues to lead the small business merchant SaaS market in growth and scale and remains on track to reach the expected $4.5 billion in revenue in 2026. Clover first did a second consecutive quarter of 30% revenue growth, supported by new merchant ads, and a 20% penetration of value-added solutions. Second, we are launching multiple new Clover products this year. In the first quarter, we rolled out a larger kitchen display system and our ordering kiosks for the restaurant vertical. Around mid-year, we'll be rolling out a new Clover device called the Compact. In the second-half of the year, we expect to begin offering additional software solutions for the professional services vertical. Third, out progress in international markets continues to differentiate Pfizer. Demand for Clover is strong in Germany and leads our building from Albert Joint Venture with Deutsche Bank. In the Netherlands, where we acquired the remaining portion of the joint venture from our bank partner last year, we are seeing pent-up demand for Clover. In Argentina, we are having success adding merchants to Clover as we prepare to launch it in Brazil and Mexico in the second-half of the year. In Asia-Pac, we continue to build on our high-end hospitality market leadership, signing the Grand Hyatt in Q1 to reach over 25 five-star properties in Singapore and Malaysia. We continue to ramp up distribution as we prepare for the Clover launch in the APAC region. We already have over 50 ISO and PayFac partners, and we onboarded more partners in Q1, including KPay, which added 20,000 merchants onto our platform. We continued to expect a full-featured Clover launch in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong in 2025. Fourth, our value-added solutions penetration continues to rise. In Q1, Clover VAS penetration reached 20% on growth in Clover SaaS, Clover Capital, and Rapid Deposit. In the enterprise business, we are seeing a newer VAS opportunity emerge with our SnapPay product, a B2B payments offering for mid-market merchants that integrate seamlessly with popular ERP solutions. After over 20% revenue growth in 2023, SnapPay is poised for continued strength this year. Covanta Energy signed up for SnapPay in Q1, and we had an additional government win with the State of Texas to digitize revenue collection activity. We also entered into our first major reseller agreement for SnapPay, opening the opportunity to reach even more mid-market clients. Fifth and finally, we continue to add new merchant relationships across the SMB and enterprise markets. Building on the success we saw in 2023, Clover Sport added over 20 new venues, putting 1,000s of new Clover devices in the market. Venues include stadiums that are home to teams in the MLB, NFL, and NTAA, as well as amphitheaters, golf courses, and large-scale festivals. In our enterprise business, we address a wide breadth of industries and a growing presence in new markets, such as social gaming, which is a $10 billion opportunity by volume and growing around 20%. We signed three more clients in this space in Q1 and now serve 13 social gaming merchants, including three of the top five. We are seeing good uptake of Commerce Hub, our single orchestration layer that allows enterprise clients to operate a unified omnichannel platform. In Q1, our Commerce Hub client count surpassed 200. These five are just some of the ways we plan to achieve the targets we've set for 2026. Turning to the financial solutions segment, demand for modernization and innovation is on full display. We posted four Finxact wins for new and traditional use cases in Q1. Although we do not expect the revenue contribution to be significant in 2024, this progress reinforces Finxact\u2019s capability and flexibility as a cloud-based core banking and embedded finance platform. Let's take a deeper look at all four. First, Finxact will be the core platform for a new U.S.-based digital bank from Banco Inter Brazil, a current Fiserv client. Second, Finxact won a deal with the FinTech program manager that helps businesses access the payments ecosystem. This client decided to upgrade to Finxact and consolidate volumes on the platform. Third, Finxact signed a current Fiserv SMB solutions aggregator client as they build embedded finance for their merchant clients. This opportunity ties deeper into Fiserv as we will be working without financial institution clients to find sponsors of these lending services. Fourth and finally, Finxact won a deal to become the core account processor for a major U.S. government agency as part of the client's much larger modernization plan, which will pull in other parts of our business. It's clear that Finxact is demonstrating its capability across the broader financial services landscape. And we're encouraged by its growing pipeline today and the bigger opportunity it can bring to Fiserv over time. Turning to credit issuing, we partnered with Robinhood as it launches its gold card program following the acquisition of X1, which is built on Fiserv Credit Processing. We also extend our relationship with Kuwait Finance House on the back of its acquisition of Ali United Bank and will be migrating that card portfolio onto our platform. These are two more examples of how financial institution M&A is presenting more opportunities and risk as our technology leadership grows clearer. Lastly, in Digital Payment Solutions, demand among our core account clients and other financial institutions remains strong. One of the fastest growing examples of this is Zelle, the largest B2B payment platform where we remain the leading third-party systems integrator and recorded 45% transaction growth in Q1. A second example that's still emerging is FedNow and RTP, where we sign more than 500 financial institutions to provide access to these real-time realms. And perhaps our biggest medium to long-term opportunity is cash flow central, our small business accounts payable, accounts receivable solution that we are currently marketing to banks as resellers. The product will be available this summer and we've already sold it to four large banks including U.S. Bank announced in February and this month Bolton Bank and Citizens Bank. You should also expect to see cash flow central distributed through Clover later this year. The product is off to a great start and we are encouraged by what we are seeing. And now let me turn the call over to Bob to walk you through the financials in more detail. Bob Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on slide four. First quarter performance demonstrated our ability to deliver top line growth and continue to drive margin expansion. First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $1.6 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.8%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, our adjusted revenue was recast as part of our realign segment reporting. And if you haven't already, I encourage you to review our 8-K filing from March 26 for historical comparisons. The recast numbers include a small change to our adjusted revenue in the prior years to account for all pass-through postage. In our prior reporting, we adjusted the postage pass-through revenue only from our output business, which represents the significant majority of our postage activity. We are now adjusting out the non-output pass-through postage revenue as well. The change slightly lowered our adjusted revenue for the recast prior periods and better aligns with our internal reporting. On an organic basis, revenue grew 20% in the quarter, with particular ongoing strength in Merchant Solutions organic revenue, which was up 36%, and steady growth of 5% in financial solutions organic revenue. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.88, compared to $1.58 in the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q1 grew well above the 14$% to 16% growth level anticipated for the full-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $454 million. While this number is lower than normally seen in the quarter, it is in line with our expectations given the timing of payments for the green tax credit program. This timing is consistent with what we described during last quarter's earnings call, and we expect this cash flow headwind to become a tailwind in the second-half of this year when we apply the credit to lower our second-half cash tax payments. We continue to expect to generate $4.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Turning to performance by segment. Starting on slide five, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solution Segment was 36% in the quarter. This includes a 15-point benefit from excess revenue driven by above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 21%. On slide six, we've added a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant Segment revenue, and the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 13% in the quarter. It includes a 23 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso and the impact of the devaluation in late December last year. Unlike in 2023, the currency headwind in Q1 \u201824 was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind. If interest and inflation fall back to normal levels, which we expect to happen in the medium term. We anticipate the headwind from foreign currency exchange would ease as well. Moving to the business lines, small business organic revenue growth and adjusted revenue growth was 45% and 16% respectively. Small business volume growth was 8%. As I mentioned, over the last few quarters, revenue from the excess inflation interest in Argentina is boosting organic growth, while the currency devaluation is a headwind to adjusted revenue. Clover revenue grew 30% in the first quarter and annualized payment volume growth of 19%. The spread between revenue and volume growth reflects a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and some pricing. Vast penetration reached 20% in Q1, up from 19% in Q4, and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. The increase was driven by revenue from Clover Capital, Rapid Deposit, and our basic Clover SaaS plans. Clover Capital is our short-term working capital advance program. Rapid deposit allows merchants to access money from daily car sales instantly for a fee. And while there are several standard Clover SaaS plans, the basic package includes virtual terminal, e-commerce products, developer tools, invoicing, and transaction reports. These are just some examples of the value-added solutions available with Clover. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth was 29% and 6% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher vast penetration. As in small business, organic growth includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but was also impacted by the inclusion of three lower growth products as part of the shift in our business segmentation to start this year. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue grew by 9% and 10%, respectively. As mentioned in the past, processing represents the back-end processing we do for our partners where they own the merchant relationship. The increase this quarter was driven by a termination fee from an existing client, who canceled a planned expansion into new geographies. This will not impact ongoing revenue in established geographies where our relationship with this client remains strong. Excluding periodic revenue, processing revenue declined 2% in the quarter. This business line has no revenue from Argentina. Overall, we continue to anticipate processing adjusted revenue to be roughly flat over the medium term. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solution Segment increased 30% to $769 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin of 440 basis points to 34.1%. In accordance with GAAP, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have still expanded a very strong 390 basis points for the quarter. Turning to slide seven, on the Financial Solutions Segment, organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments, organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5%. Dell transactions and number of clients continue to grow at a healthy clip at 45% and 20% respectively. And we continue to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. Issuing organic and adjusted revenue grew 8% and 3% respectively, driven by several factors, including the launch of money network cards to unemployment and disability benefit recipients under the California Employment Development Department Program. Banking organic and adjusted revenue declined 1% and 3%, respectively. Excluding periodic license and termination fee revenue, banking organic revenue grew 2%. First quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solution segment was up 6% to $1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 160 basis points to 44.1%, driven by operating leverage from scaled revenue growth and cost efficiency. As we highlighted at our Investor Conference in November, the cross Fiserv activity between our two segments is particularly powerful, because following the success of the Fiserv first data merger, we are the only single provider of merchant, Bank IT, and payments functionality. Let me share three examples where we've had important cross-Fiserv wins in Q1. In our debit networks, STAR and Accel, we have five merchant wins in the quarter, including ConocoPhillips, a traditional merchant, along with a social media company and a PayFac, both of which will be able to benefit from more choice under Reg II. Traditional and online merchants are using our debit networks to efficiently route card transactions at the point of sale. These wins drive revenue in our digital payments business line and often go hand in hand with merchant acquiring wins and other value-added solution sales that only Fiserv offers. A second example can be found in open banking, where we provide our data solutions to facilitators such as Plaid and MasterCard Open Banking as a single API into the open banking data of our financial institution clients. In Q1, we signed a data access agreement with Visa Open Banking Solutions acquired through Tink as they entered the U.S. The data is typically used by clients of these organizations to verify bank accounts for payments and transfers, underwrite loans, and facilitate financial wellness and planning, and by merchants to facilitate pay-by-bank transactions as just a few examples. Third, over the past year, we have announced a number of wins in the government sector, and we're excited about our continued momentum in this large vertical across our merchant and financial segments. Revenue from government clients recently surpassed $500 million. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $148 billion in the quarter, largely in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.2%. The Q1 tax rate is traditionally below the full-year rate, and we continue to expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full-year. Total debt outstanding was $24.4 billion on March 31. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio slightly increased to 2.8 times within our targeted leverage range. And we have approximately 7% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $4.7 billion. We had 42 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases, and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As Frank said earlier, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the full year. One quarter into the year, we are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth rate outlook. While the interest in inflation tailwind from Argentina eased faster than we expected, further moves in the balance of the year remain unclear, while our overall business remains strong. For the full-year, we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion to be more than 125 basis points, up from our previous outlook of at least 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.60 to $8.75, a $0.05 increase in our outlook at the midpoint, which is 14% to 16% growth over 2023. This performance for 2024 would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. Last week we published our fourth corporate social responsibility report. In it, we highlight the ways we execute on our four strategic pillars : empower people, advance communities and society; champion responsible business practices; and invest in sustainable systems. In summary, we believe that doing good is good for business. We are committed to diverse representation at all levels of the organization, including leadership positions. We continue to engage with communities where we live and work, including small businesses and minority depository institutions. We recognize the importance of strong governance as part of our overall strategy, and we continue to invest in sustainability. For the first time, our CSR report includes a greenhouse gas reduction goal. Later this year, we will be celebrating two important milestones for Fiserv. Our 40th year in business and our 5th year since merging with First Data. On these occasions, you naturally reflect on what it means to come of a certain age. For Fiserv 40-years old means proven, resilient, and experienced to deliver on our commitments, and we've done just that. It also means scaled, savvy and well capitalized to sustain strong top and bottom line growth. We are doing that as well. But when you consider the significant change created by the merger, we're also a lot like a young five-year-old company. Five means a fresh foundation to support investment. We have used our cash to invest in products, services, and people and that's driving higher growth. Five also means a longer term opportunity ahead, fueled by innovation, and therefore we see continued strong further top and bottom line growth at Pfizer. The proven strength of 40 combined with the opportunistic growth of five puts Pfizer in a distinguished position to both lead and drive innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of this is possible because of our over 40,000 employees. I would like to thank them for what they do for our clients, shareholders, and each other. Thank you for your time today. And now, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Great to see Clover revenue growth sustained at 30% with accelerating payment volume growth and higher VAS attach rates. When you look at the picture for Clover for the year as a whole, can revenue growth sustain in this high-20s to low-30s range, you know, when you look at the Brazil market entry, Argentina expansion, and VAS growth opportunities? Frank Bisignano : Yes, hey, thanks David. You know, we've been focused on all of those for quite some time, and we treat unveiling new product, new initiatives, new market, while continuing to, you know, draw on the embedded business we have generating new merchants, right? So, you know, our basic philosophy is increase the number of merchants we have, be able to deliver more products to merchants, and then go into the areas that we haven't been before. So we feel very, very good about what we laid out a couple of years ago and what we talked about in November. You can see the traction here, which is kind of above what the CAGR needed to be, but you should expect us to be all cylinders on Clover, as we have a bunch of other parts about company also, I would have to say. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Good morning. Just the increase here in the operating margin, how much of that 25 bps is from favorable mix versus other surprises, maybe the term fee and processing, and the Argentine, of course, is always a factor there. Just curious on the increase, and then any call-outs for the second quarter or the second-half with respect to the margin? Thanks. Bob Hau : Yes, Tien-Tsin, it\u2019s Bob, good morning. I think overall the 25 basis points that you're describing our full-year outlook, moving from previously at least 100 basis points, margin expansion to now more than 125 is really driven by continued volume leverage, strong growth in the overall company, as well as continued progress on productivity. The termination fee in the processing is relatively small in the grand scheme. Obviously, it matters a bit in the processing line for this quarter, but in terms of the overall company's margin improvement, it really is continued volume leverage and a focus on productivity. Frank Bisignano : Yes, and I\u2019d just add, you know, when we think about running this company, our investment in technology is really around new product development, improved service, and the ability to deliver the next dollar of revenue at a better incremental cost by investing in productivity. So that will be for the rest of our lives. An AI and those type of items just allow us to do more of it. We're at the tip of that, but you know we can see our way very clearly this year. Q - Tien-Tsin Huang Nice color. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : Yes, hey guys, great job again. And maybe just on the financial segment, digital slowed a bit this quarter. I think it was 5% or 7% to 8% the last few quarters. Wondering just about that and if Reg II, if you've kind of fully benefited from that or if that still has incremental room to benefit and accelerate growth in that part? Bob Hau : Yes, David, good morning. On the Reg II, I'd say that there's still probably more opportunity ahead than what we've seen. It remains to truly be seeing what that means. We're seeing good uptick in our network business, whether that's really driven by Reg II or just continued progress in our debit business, I think it's just more continued progress. In terms of a slowdown, I wouldn't read anything into it other than quarterly fluctuations and a tough comp against Q1 prior year. Dave Koning : Got it. Thanks. And if I can just do one more quick. SMB grew so fast 45%. Clover grew 30%. So non-Clover is actually growing faster, which I assume is just Argentina. But maybe how is non-Argentina, non-Clover doing, and is there room for that to keep growing well too? Bob Hau : Non-Argentina, non-Clover. I'll have to pull up my Venn diagrams here. You know, obviously tongue in cheek there. Bottom line is we're seeing good growth, obviously, across the entire SMB business. That small business certainly has good growth from Clover, and you saw the 30% growth in Clover. We continue to see real opportunity there. On the non-Clover side, there's certainly impact from Argentina. There's a small piece of Clover Argentina there, but the 30% growth is really heavily driven by the United States growth there. On the overall segments, you heard us talk in the prepared remarks about the Argentine impact from organic growth. We continue to see that easing later into the year. It was a bit lower than what we expected in the first quarter, i.e., inflation and interest eased a little bit faster than we anticipated. In previous, in the last earnings call, we indicated we expect about a 14% impact from Argentina for the full-year in the merchant business. Q1 came in a little bit above that. We expect that to ease into later part of the year. That certainly impacts the non-Clover business. But overall, non-Clover is growing quite well. And we continue to see opportunity. It's not just about adding Clover in small businesses. It's supporting them wherever they want to take merchant acquiring solutions. The other thing I would add, and it's an impact to the first quarter that we expect to ease into the balance of the year, is in Q1, we saw the benefit of a better-than-expected lift on the use of foreign-based currency credit cards in Argentina. This is some people may have heard the term dollar turista. The Argentine government has a program sponsored by the Central Bank to encourage foreign currency denominated credit cards. And we saw that pick up in the first quarter. That is a program that the Argentine government has at their discretion to help the economy. Obviously, they're seeing the economy improve. So I would certainly not anticipate a 45% small business organic growth into the future. And we're seeing some of that kind of transitory impact this quarter. Dave Koning : Got it. Great job. Thanks, guys. Frank Bisignano : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Looking at the gap between the 19% volume growth and the 30% revenue growth for Clover, you hit it pretty well I think on the VAS adding about 900 basis points. It just implies that there's a small component there from direct mix hardware and pricing as you mentioned? So I just wanted to see if you could provide some context on the path to the $4.5 billion, how we should think about those other contributors direct hardware and pricing contributing? And maybe a different way to ask it is, should we expect the volume growth to stay in this sort of high-teens range, or should we expect slightly higher turnover of volume growth? Bob Hau : So, a number of elements to that question. First, in order to achieve the $4.5 billion goal that we set out ahead by 2026, we need kind of a very high 20% call it 28% total Clover revenue growth. As part of that goal, we've indicated we expect VAS to achieve 27% penetration from the current quarter Q1 at 20%. So certainly a big part of it is additional VAS. And we've talked about this in the past, the secret recipe to growing Clover to $4.5 billion is actually not so secret. It's get new merchants, sell more stuff to those merchants, and grow with those merchants, and that's exactly what we see. To your point, in the current quarter, there was a big part of the overall revenue left. Certainly, the delta between revenue and volume was driven by VAS. We kind of gave the sequence in order of importance, and I think that will continue as we progress over the next couple of years as we march towards that $4.5 billion, VAS will be a big part of it. This is always priced depending on what's going on with inflation, what's going on in the market, but that's probably the third of the three important factors. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you. Bob Hau : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning guys. I just had a two-part question on merchant. The first is just do you have the total segment volume and transaction growth for the quarter? Not sure if you're going to continue to provide that going forward? And then the second part is just on the April comments. Frank, I think you indicated actually a little bit of an uptick in April relative to Q1, which could be viewed as a bit of an upside surprise considering Easter timing and how that fell this year? So just curious which parts of merchant might have performed better so far in April versus Q1. Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Hey Bob take the first part, I'll take the second. Bob Hau : Yes, so the first part of your question is, in our prepared remarks, we gave a small business volume growth at 8% and enterprise transactions growth at 12%. Given the way we're reporting now for that Merchant Solution Segment and the three business lines. We felt that the volume for small business is the driver of revenue, and for transactions, it's enterprise. Transaction activity in small business is not a revenue driver and volume for enterprise is not a revenue driver. So we thought providing the key metrics that really are driving the business was important. Frank Bisignano : And just to be clear on clarity, a small tracking, a small growth, I want it. And I put it in the non-discretionary buckets. If you're thinking about where it occurred. Obviously, that's, you know, an early indicator. It's not necessarily, you know, how the whole quarter is going to play, but we always feel committed to be able to talk to you about what we see, you know, the vast amount of volume we have going throughout the -- both in the U.S. and around the world, and I consider it a small increase. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Dan. Yes, we'll go to Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Great results. I just have a quick question on Pay Easy. Can you maybe give us some context on the conversion to Clover, you know, about roughly timing and contribution and are there any other conversions that we should be expecting? Thanks again. Frank Bisignano : Yes, the way -- great question. The way we think about, Pay Easy, it was a processing system that were retired and then built out both commerce hub and brought some of that volume, which already existed through Clover to the future new merchants. That was completed, migrated, multi-year project that we built out in a way that allowed us to build out Commerce Hub, that allowed us to deliver VAS into Commerce Hub and also have Pay Easy operating within our SMB base. So I feel great about closing the books on that from a conversion standpoint. And we're seeing on the enterprise side, you heard us talk about 200 Commerce Hub users and a strategic platform for us going forward. Dan Dolev : Great. Thank you and great results again. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about M&A and what you're seeing out there. It feels like there's a little more opportunity, maybe urgency on the side of sellers in the sort of Fintech industry. What are you seeing and what's your appetite right now for doing a deal? Frank Bisignano : Well, you know, I don't know about urgency on sellers' parts as much as valuation and understanding what real valuations are. Now, we have a really great model, which we talked about our ability to generate cash flow, investing in our business, and the ability to deploy capital. I think we've done a very, very good job in the assets we've acquired, integrated, and grown. And so I'd say our appetite to acquire properties is always high. I mean, we're always trafficking. I think on the other hand, you know, we want to be very, very, very clear that it fits within our strategy, which I think is holding tight. It's within our structure and the ability to distribute the product to our vast client base both on the merchant side and on the FI side. You know, so, you know, I like to believe that we're always engaged and working and thinking through it. And we're highly selective to make sure we're using our shareholders' dollars as appropriately as possible. And I think we've got a pretty darn good track record in that so far. Bob Hau : Ramsey, I think I'll carry your analogy one step further in terms of the question on appetite. If appetite's good, it's strong appetite, but we're not hungry. So, you know, you go to the shopping mall or to the grocery store, when you're hungry you buy a lot of stuff. You get home and you realize you didn't need all that stuff. We're certainly seeing a lot of activity, but we're not hungry. And while we have tremendous capacity on our balance sheet and could do deals, we're making sure that what we see is of good value and brings value to our shareholders before we go ahead and strike on it. Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thanks. Bob Hau : Thanks, Ramsey. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Christopher Kennedy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Christopher Kennedy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So we have good targets for the value-added solutions for Clover. Is there a way to think about the opportunity for some of the other operating systems such as Carat, DNA, Finxact, or Optus? Frank Bisignano : Well, I think it\u2019s a -- we have not articulated goals around them, but they're clearly embedded in our guide and the things we think about our growth rates, right? I think what we think about, even at a more broader standpoint, is what those are, right? And you could go across the board from our fraud integration products like advanced defense to how even we bring in cash flow central. You heard us talk about that and that really hangs both in the SMB space through our own distribution and then, you know, obviously attached to a banking product. I think, you know, over time we probably should come back with a better clarity around some of it. Having said that, we've been selling value-added services to our clients, we've sold a gift product into our enterprise for a long time. We've sold different forms of data and information to them. So I think really the way we look at it at the large macro level in the enterprise is really that you can go back to the circle that we used to have about, we're going to sell a core, but really all the revenue comes when growth comes from debit, credit, right? Digital, and in their own right, those are value-added services hanging off the core. The same is true in our enterprise business and merchant. So I think in reality, when you look at how we report, we are reporting, you know, our economics and some of those actually value-added services and business lines also. So, you know, I'll go think about it a little more, but I think, you know, it's encompassed in the economics and how we show our business lines. Christopher Kennedy : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to -- yes next we\u2019ll go to the Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Jamie Friedman : Hi. Good morning. And I wanted to mention I appreciate the incremental disclosures. The segmentation is really helpful. I wanted to ask about government. Frank, you -- and if I mess this up because the transcript is not out yet, but I thought you said it's a $500 million category. Again, I apologize if I heard that wrong. But what I wanted to ask is, is it correct that, that rolls into the financial solutions segment? And if possible if you could unpack like where in there, like is it issuing specifically? And generally, how are you going to market with government? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Good. So why don't I start with how are we going to government, how are we going to market in government? We've been focused on government as a very large vertical calling and that is everywhere from state and local to federal. And so we have a team and their sole job is government, right? And the traffic in the transactions, you've even been hurt. And you know, our thought was always, it transcends the org. That's why we have dedicated client sales force to it because, you know, at times we have opportunities to bid on merchant acquiring. At times you heard us talk about delivering FinXact. You know, the government is we called out the $0.5 because it demonstrated where we started, which was very, very small to the growth, but it transcends both segments. And on any given day, almost any one of our products can play in the government space, right? You know, so I don't know if that answers your question, but I think about it as dedicated coverage model, right? Transcending the businesses, and it can be anywhere from our core Finxact, which we just delivered to money network to merchant acquiring and we really love this segment, vertical, however you want to think about it. And we have a great, great team that knows how to cover government, and we've been very fortunate in that win. Jamie Friedman : Great. Thanks for the call. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if we can help us understand not only where you're seeing success with Clover in the market competitively, but how you're thinking about continuing to improve its positioning in the market. I mean, it seems like value-added services is a key part of that, but are there other things or aspects we should be thinking about and love to get your sense of what your win rates, if you have any idea of that, versus other competitors in the market? Thank you very much. Frank Bisignano : Well, I try to be as clear as possible on this, Clover covers the whole SMB market and expands a little further, because you've heard about the 1,000s of Clovers we delivered in the quarter to venues, right? You know, it's a 30% grower today. We have talked very hard and have worked to do to finish the swing on restaurant, but feel very, very clear about our ability there. You know, you'll see us go deeper in professional services and in retail. Remember, it's a horizontal platform that we brought vertical expertise to. And then, you know, we have great demand outside the U.S., as you heard us talk about, along with the ability to continue to distribute through our channels like more in our ISV channel. So I think it spans the landscape of SMB. Obviously, our growth, which is through new business acquisition, has demonstrated at the 30% mark. And, you know, it's an open platform that we continue to add more software to. And so when you put that all together and where we started with, I like to remind us inside the house and outside the house that we were seven engineers and three patents and now you know we have more than a 1,000 software engineers across the world operating on it [Technical Difficulty] so we're going to complete rolling and so commensal across the world. James Faucette : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Good. And I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions, and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fiserv second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of Fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measure to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss second quarter results that bring us closer to another year of double-digit organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. Fiserv delivered strong results across our businesses with second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.13, up 18% driven by continued healthy revenue growth and further operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 160 basis points to 38.4%. Organic revenue growth was 18%. We can point to many highlights in our business during the quarter, including Clover revenue of 28%, accelerated organic revenue growth in financial solutions to 8%, multiple wins with marquee clients including Verizon and Apple, plus new clients in important verticals such as petro, gaming, government and healthcare. Our free cash flow was $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion over the last 12 months, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. This month, we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of Fiserv, along with the fifth anniversary of the merger between Fiserv and First Data. Our vision back in 2019 was that if we brought together scaled platforms supporting a full breadth of solutions, merchant acquiring, debit and credit issuer services, digital payments of all kinds and core bank account systems modernized with cloud technologies, then clients would find value in the combination and the integration and Fiserv would become a partner of choice with unparalleled global reach. Today, we can see that\u2019s exactly what has happened. As we realized revenue and cost synergies over this time, we increased our investment in technology innovation. Our purpose has been to deliver solutions to clients of all kinds, established and new, large and small, local and global, spanning all verticals. With the proper amount of disrupting ourselves then and now, Fiserv is better able to run, optimize and grow our business, and now we find ourselves at this moment, singular in our ability to deliver a breadth of leading products across a diverse base of clients and demonstrating accelerated growth for the past three years. After five years of innovation, in some ways what\u2019s old is new again. Let me share three examples of how our clients are engaging in some of our traditional businesses as new ways to add and retain their own customers. First in merchant acquiring, banks are adding this service as a way to grow with small and medium sized business customers and choosing Fiserv for its leading solutions, including Clover. We already have nearly 900 financial institutions who offer merchant processing services to their small business clients, and thousands more who can still benefit from doing so. As an example, in Q2 we signed a merchant agreement with Connecticut Online Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. The 150 community banks and credit unions on the COCC platform now have access to our acquiring services in support of their own hundreds of thousands of merchants. Second in digital payments, CashFlow Central takes the best of consumer bill pay and turns it from a cost center within banks to a revenue generator that appeals to small business with bill payment and presentment capability. In the second quarter, we signed two more CashFlow Central deals with multi-billion dollar banks for a total of six in the few months since we introduced this solution. CashFlow Central will go live this quarter and the pipeline remains full. We are finding that as they go down this path, financial institutions are revitalizing the consumer bill pay offerings as well, answering the competition from the direct biller model. First Citizens, a top 20 U.S. bank with more than $200 billion in assets was one such consumer bill pay win in Q2. As a reminder, Fiserv is the largest provider of bank consumer bill pay services with over 20 million users on our check-free platform. Both merchant acquiring solutions and CashFlow Central are compelling because they provide revenue generating opportunities for our financial institution clients. They also demonstrate a distinct value proposition for small businesses which includes other products across our issuing and banking businesses. Next, we are integrating these solutions with Experience Digital, or XD, our new online and mobile banking solution; and third, traditional enterprise merchants are turning to software that surround their payments functionality to enhance revenue and improve data integration. As we\u2019ve seen from small businesses, the large and midmarket merchants who have been migrating to our omnichannel platform are increasingly integrating our value-added solutions. These include SnapPay, our ERP-integrated B2B bill presentment platform; gift solutions, where we support multiple leading retail and QSR enterprise clients; and data analytics, which I\u2019ll discuss a bit later. We continue to invest in new solutions such as our new dedicated platform for paybacks, which is gaining momentum. In the second quarter, for instance, we were selected by Cantaloupe, a major provider of unattended payment devices such as vending machines, for our Exchange payback platform, and we continue to integrate solutions across our two segments. One example is our new partnership with Apple that will enable new Apple Pay functionality with two of our next-generation solutions. One is pay with points, where the loyalty points residing on the card accounts of our issuer clients can be redeemed for a transaction in the Apple Pay wallet at checkout, serving as currency. We are a natural partner given the breadth of our card accounts on file and our technical capability to maintain account point balances, convert and accept those points as payments, and then reconcile the balances. A second solution is installment loans on credit cards. This is a new feature that presents the consumer with the choice to pay for a purchase in a set of installments when using Apple Pay at checkout. This is differentiating in that consumers have only been provided with the option to pay for a purchase in installments after making a purchase on a credit card. With Apple, we will move this installment loan feature into the checkout flow, giving the consumer choice at the point of purchase. Having this functionality at the point of sale from a digital wallet can drive greater card conversion, card usage, and spending power. It also enables our issuing partners to more directly compete with Buy Now, Pay Later using their existing credit card products. Fiserv is unique in its reach across all parties involved here : the consumer, the digital wallet provider, the issuer and the merchant, so we see multiple opportunities ahead as we enable this network effect to be a win-win across the ecosystem. Let\u2019s turn to our outlook for the business. Based on strong performance in the quarter and conviction in our unique opportunity set, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $8.65 to $8.80, an increase of $0.05 across the range. Our revenue outlook is unchanged at 15% to 17% organic growth. This performance for 2024 would represent the 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Turning to our segment highlights, in merchant solutions starting with small business, we posted 4% volume growth, slightly ahead of the sales volume growth for the Fiserv Small Business Index, which rose 3.2% in Q2 as the pace of growth slowed from April to June. There are multiple reasons why our growth can differ from this U.S.-only index, including our global presence and different weightings across verticals. For Clover, we have a very active second half of the year for new product rollouts. We plan to launch additional restaurant software features that target our sweet spot in casual dining to enhance table management, kitchen operations, inventory and cost management. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be rolling out new software offerings in our two other target verticals, services and retail. We are very pleased with initial sales of our restaurant order kiosks and now we look forward to two new hardware opportunities. First is the Clover Compact, which we rolled out this month, giving us a broader market opportunity with smaller merchants, and next an important solution for our restaurant clients, order and pay at the table via a new handheld Clover Flex Pocket, coming in August. We are on pace with our international expansion. Pilots are set to go live in Brazil and Mexico in August, and then in September in Australia ahead of the 2025 launch. In the enterprise merchant business, a key driver is the ongoing adoption of Commerce Hub, the orchestration layer that allows for easy integration with our growing portfolio of value-added solutions. We now have 230 clients live on Commerce Hub and signed several more in Q2, including two large petro retailers to extend our leading position in this vertical. Our financial solutions segment posted strong organic revenue growth at 8% in the quarter, above the high end of our 2024 guidance range. We delivered faster organic growth in our banking business while our core banking and credit union clients continued to drive strong growth in our digital payments business. We are adding new clients as well. In the second quarter, we had another example of winning the core account processing business in an M&A transaction. In this latest case, Sunflower Bank chose Fiserv after announcing their intent to acquire HomeStreet Bank to create a $17 billion bank by assets in January. In issuing, we manage the credit and loan accounts for some of the world\u2019s leading issuers and provide technology to issuers and lenders in healthcare, government and education. In June, we were very pleased to have won a strategic outsourcing agreement with Verizon to support their device financing activity and manage device payment agreements on Fiserv\u2019s Optis platform. Verizon chose Fiserv for the flexibility, optionality and resiliency of our platform on the foundation of a trusted longstanding relationship that spans multiple solutions. This is another example of extending our issuer and loan processing capability into adjacent verticals. In fact, we won another point of sale financing deal with an industrial equipment manufacturer to offer short term loans through its dealer network across the globe using our First Vision platform. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to discuss more on outperformance and financials. Bob Hau : Thank you Frank, and good morning everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I\u2019ll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Our performance in the second quarter showcased our ability to sustain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.8 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $1.8 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.4%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $9.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $3.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 37.2%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 18% in the quarter with strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from Argentina was five points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from seven points in Q1. In the first six months of the year, organic revenue grew 19%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.13 compared to $1.81 in the prior year, up 18% and above previous full year guidance of 4% to 16%. Year to date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $4 compare to $3.38 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. We expect free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the merchant solutions segment was 28% in the quarter and 32% year to date. For the quarter, this includes a 10-point benefit from above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 18%. On Slide 6, we\u2019ve again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and merchant segment revenue, along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for merchant solutions was 9% in the quarter and 11% year to date. The quarterly results include a 19 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q1, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in Q2. Moving to the business lines, small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 35% and 13% respectively. Clover revenue grew 28% in the second quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. The spread between revenue and volume growth continues to reflect a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and value-based pricing. VAS penetration stayed constant sequentially at 20% in Q2, an improvement from prior years where we typically see a seasonal decline from Q1 to Q2. VAS penetration was driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package and should expand with several new offerings coming in the second half. Overall, we remain on pace to meet our 2026 targets. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 27% and 9% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 8% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth at enterprise includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina. We\u2019re pleased with the pace of client uptake and growth in Commerce Hub. Daily transactions in Commerce Hub are up 3.5 times from Q1 levels and clients are increasingly connecting to enhanced solutions. Three of the most popular are pay by bank, which allows consumers to pay via ACH payment from their bank account at the point of sale; online EVT, which lets merchants grow by offering payment via government benefit programs; and digital payouts, which merchants increasingly use to pay employees and vendors. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 7% and 8% respectively. This business represents the bank end processing we do for our partners, where they own the merchant relationship. A few large processing clients experienced declines in their volumes and revenue in Q2. Year to date, processing organic and adjusted revenue are both up 1%, similar to our guidance for flat adjusted revenue over the medium term. Turning to some merchant highlights outside the U.S., first in EMEA, the general tone of business is improving as inflation is easing and consumer confidence begins to rise across the region. We had a good quarter for new wins and renewals with follow-on business, and we are finding that our professional services capability in the region is a competitive differentiator that reinforces our right to win. We expanded our strategic partnership with BNP Paribas, one of the leading banks in Europe, allowing it to extend its current merchant acquiring footprint into Germany. Also in Germany, H&M Group, the second-largest clothing retailer in the world, selected us as their strategic partner for point of sale, building on our existing relationship in Mexico and highlighting the value we bring to multi-national retail clients. We are also working with Lloyd\u2019s Banking Group, one of the leading banks in the U.K. and a key partner for Fiserv, on a major business transformation program for Cardnet, our merchant acquiring joint venture. Together, we will deliver tailored solutions including Clover, dynamic currency conversion and merchant cash advance to add new and grow existing merchant relationships. We\u2019ve also been selected by Deutsche Bahn, the national railway company of Germany and one of the largest railway companies in the world, to provide terminals, network services and value-added solutions. We extended our relationship with Absa, one of Africa\u2019s largest diversified financial services groups. We will be implementing our full AQaaS solution, or acquiring as a service, which will allow Absa to process ecommerce transactions in nine African countries. AQaaS integrates multiple value-added solutions including payment gateway, merchant onboarding, merchant portal, omnipay back office, open FX, and real time fraud monitoring. Finally, we\u2019ve extended our merchant acquiring relationship with \u017babka Polska, the largest convenience store chain in central and eastern Europe, based in Poland, with over 11,000 stores. We\u2019ve grown to provide more than 20 products to this innovative client, most recently adding merchant cash advance, a growing value-added solution for us in the region. Moving to Latin America, in Brazil the extension of our Caixa relationship to their bill pay locations has begun to ramp with sequential volume growth of over 20% in Q2. In addition, we went live with our pilot for our Pix platform to act as a payment service provider to over 30 merchants. This capability came through the acquisition of Sled in November of 2023 and will open up new growth opportunities from instant payment activity in Brazil. Overall, we continue to grow our instant payment transactions in Brazil and Argentina. In Brazil, we reached more than 400 million transactions in Q2, up 21% from Q1 levels, and we doubled our number of transactions in Argentina. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our pilot merchant acquiring services in New Zealand, a new market for Fiserv. We plan to target omnichannel merchants primarily in the hospitality and retail segments, as well as ecommerce-only merchants, aggregation partners and payfacs. Adjusted operating income in the merchant solutions segment increased 18% to $882 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 36.6%. Year to date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $1.7 billion with adjusted operating margin up 360 basis points to 35.4%. As noted last quarter, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 220 basis points for the quarter and 300 year to date. Turning to Slide 7 on the financial solutions segment, organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year to date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 8% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continued to be strong at 43%, and we signed one of our largest bank clients yet on Zelle, First Horizon Bank with $82 billion in assets, and the pipeline includes other large prospects. We continued to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. In Q2, we signed 32 FIs to FedNow, bringing our total signed to nearly 300. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 9% and 4% respectively in the quarter, driven by account growth internationally and new loan accounts in North America. Another growth vertical that we\u2019ve been highlighting is government, where we continue to win and convert large programs, including the California Employment Development Department, which has enrolled over 1 million of our money network prepaid cards, funding nearly $5 billion. In Q2, we won an electronic funds transfer mandate with a major U.S. agency which should help extend our double-digit growth in the federal market. We also won several state and local deals on the merchant side of the business, including Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, and the City of San Francisco. Meanwhile, we are continuing to make strides with prior large wins, implementing the first phase of a target program with output services, though we expect the vast majority of revenue will start in Q1 2025, when the Circle card accounts begin to go live. Issuing has a meaningful and growing presence outside the U.S., and we have been investing to roll out the next generation of First Vision, our international operating platform. In Q2, we won our first client on the new First Vision platform in Brazil. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 6% and 4% respectively in the quarter. Excluding periodic revenue, organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. We had two Finxact wins this quarter, including Metropolitan Commercial Bank, a $7 billion bank and an existing Fiserv core client that has decided to build a migration path to Finxact. The pipeline remains robust, including embedded finance opportunities, and we completed the integration of Finxact with Commerce Hub. This allows our enterprise merchants to embed a robust suite of financial services for their customers across shopping and checkout experiences. Second quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solutions segment was up 6% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was consistent with a very strong second quarter last year at 45.9%. Year to date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $2.1 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 80 basis points to 45%. Now let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $134 million in the quarter and $282 million year to date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9% and 18.1% for the first half, and we continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.5 billion on June 30. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was steady at 2.8 times, within our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to just over $5 billion, and nearly $15 billion since the 2015 merger. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.65 to $8.80, up from $8.60 to $8.75, and an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 15% to 17%, from 14% to 16%. We are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook of 15% to 17%, and raising our estimate for adjusted operating margin expansion to more than 135 basis points compared to at least 125 basis points. Previously, our organic growth guidance assumed seven points of contribution from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but during Q2 we saw a faster than expected decline in both measures. This more rapid return to historic average is good news for our Argentine business and overall stability in the region; however, the extra revenue contribution will now be less this year. Based on the latest economist consensus, we now assume four points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year, down from seven points. Nevertheless, we are reiterating our previous organic growth guidance for the year despite exogenous shifts affecting our business. This capability has become a hallmark of Fiserv today. It is a testament to the adaptability of our business model that comes from a broad product portfolio, diverse client base, resourceful management team, and global reach. This quarter, we offset the lower inflation and interest benefit in Argentina with additional anticipation revenue, another quarter of d\u00f3lar turista revenue, and other growth across the company. Our full year outlook of 15% to 17% total company organic growth less the four-point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina puts our normalized growth at 11% to 13% for 2024. This is in line with our medium term guidance of 9% to 12%, which assumes macro factors from Argentina continue to normalize. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5%, and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Wrapping up with free cash flow, first I\u2019d like to note a change to our cash flow reporting. We moved the Clover Capital and LATAM anticipation activity to the investing section of the cash flow statement, beginning in the second quarter. We re-evaluated the presentation in our cash flow statement given a significant increase in the merchant cash advance activity. This change is consistent with how our peers account for these activities and the additional disclosure will provide greater transparency to our investors. This move affected our free cash flow since those amounts are no longer included in cash flows from operating activities, so we are adjusting our full year free cash flow outlook accordingly by increasing our guidance to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion, since we expected $200 million of outflows for merchants\u2019 cash advances when we originally set our 2024 outlook. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks Bob. There is another value creation opportunity within post-merger Fiserv, and that\u2019s data. The proposition for us in extracting intelligence from the massive amounts of data that we generate daily is significant and can be an important growth driver beyond the medium term. Three years ago, long before AI was the hot topic it is today, we assembled a team of internal and external experts in the fields of data science and AI. We gave them a mandate to harness all of the data naturally captured through Fiserv transactions and account processing activity to drive actionable intelligence for us, the marketplace, and our merchant and financial institution clients. There are three advantages that Fiserv has in its data. Ours is available in real time, it\u2019s granular to the transaction level, and it\u2019s multi-faceted in that it spans merchant, issuing and banking activity. This makes our data quite powerful to apply in anti-fraud solutions which we are doing internally, with plans for a client-facing solution this fall. Our first great application to the market is the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real time assessment of consumer spending at millions of small businesses published monthly. It maximizes the features of Fiserv data with its timely release two days after month end, a detailed look at trends by industry and geography, and the inclusion of non-card spending data such as cash and checks. We\u2019re also working to support clients in their AI journeys as they invest to process and understand their own data. Clients are recognizing that we can efficiently add Fiserv data and intelligence to help take decision making to the next level. It\u2019s a major value-added solution that we\u2019re already testing with several of our largest clients and on the Clover platform. We are still in the early stages of delivering our data and intelligence solutions, but the opportunity is significant given the power of our integrated platforms and our unmatched scale, breadth and investment. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their steadfast commitment to our vision and hard work on the day to day execution. It\u2019s clearly led to our leadership in product and innovation and the strong results you\u2019re seeing us report today. Together, we strive to achieve excellence every day on behalf of our clients, partners and shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and now Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you, good morning Frank and Bob. Appreciate the update on new product launches for Clover, and also the vertical market expansion into services and retail. Could you update us on the international expansion in Brazil and Mexico? Frank, you called out some initiatives in Brazil, but in terms of the broader new market launch post friends and family, what are your expectations for the back half of this year and into 2025? Frank Bisignano : Yes, I think first of all, when you look at what we\u2019re doing on global penetration, we have--you know we talked about Mexico, Australia and Brazil. You should expect Brazil and Mexico in August as a pilot. I would see it as a full ramp in 2025, I\u2019d treat August like a friends and family. But remember, our business in Brazil, the things we\u2019ve done with Caixa, the things we\u2019ve done growing the business, you know, probably eight, nine years ago from a start-up into a tremendous competitor, so we have growth projections for that market that we would expect it to perform as our business has in Brazil. Mexico - you know, we\u2019ve built a business there, we continue to grow that business. We feel our Mexico and Brazil build is very similar, that\u2019s why you see them coming out together. Once again, a friends and family in August [indiscernible], and obviously we\u2019ll watch that build through the fourth quarter and then full effect in \u201925. We feel really great about our position on Australia and what we\u2019re going to do in Australia. You\u2019ll see us in September, and that as a friends and family. We have expectations of larger partner wins there also that are very, very highly motivated to have Clover in market in \u201925, so. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a ton of growth out of it this year. We\u2019ll update you later in the year on our expectations in \u201925, but those builds are in full force. We have partners who want it bad, and we see the market demand for all that. Thanks for that question. You know, David, we got on the call and talked about a celebration that we\u2019re really having right now, which is the 40th anniversary of Fiserv and the fifth anniversary of the merger. But I think what I realized when I got up this morning is we\u2019re actually celebrating your retirement from Evercore, and if my information\u2019s right, because you know we love to count everything here, you\u2019ve covered Fiserv for 29 years and that\u2019s spanned four CEOs, and I\u2019m fortunate to stand on the shoulders of those who became before me, so I cherish our time together. Then I think I\u2019m right in 32 years on First Data - I can\u2019t really account for all the CEOs that came before me specifically post KKR, but thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for the industry. Thank you for the work, and I think it\u2019s a celebration of your career and your retirement from Evercore. Thanks for being here with us today. David Togut : Thank you so much, Frank. That really means a lot to me. I really enjoyed working with you, Bob and Julie, and in the tradition of your predecessors, you continue to create tremendous shareholder value, so I\u2019ll continue to watch your progress with great interest. Bob Hau : Congratulations, David. David Togut : Thank you Bob. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : I was going to say, I can\u2019t remember any First Data or Fiserv call without David Togut on it, so I echo that. My question for you guys, just on the margin outlook that was raised, can you give us a little bit more specifics on the sources of the upside there? Then just a clarification on the merchant processing side, was that related to some bank losses? I heard a comment that there were some declines on the bank side, so I wanted to clarify if that was line specific or due to attrition. Thank you. Bob Hau : Yes, thanks Tien-Tsin, good morning. First on the margin outlook, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we raised our margin outlook actually for the second quarter in a row, and now greater than 135 basis points. The original guide back in February was greater than 100 basis points. That\u2019s really driven by two factors. One is just the scale and volume of the company - as we add more revenue, it drops through to the company average--excuse me, better than company average rates, and continue to see good growth. The second one, of course, is ongoing productivity - we continue on an ongoing basis, as Frank said earlier, measure everything, and we continue to see progress towards achieving increased productivity across the organization, and so the combination of very strong organic growth, 15% to 17% this year plus productivity allows us to continue to expand margin on a multiple year basis. Then in the merchant processing side, as you know, the processing business line for us is where our clients own the merchant contracts, and so we are providing the back end processing for those clients. In many cases, it\u2019s banks, could be wholesale ISOs, and what we saw is some volume decline out of those processing contracts in the second quarter. Of course, on a year-to-date basis, we are plus-1% for the first half of the year, and that\u2019s in line with our ongoing expectation that it\u2019s roughly flat in this business line going forward. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Great to see the ongoing revenue performance here. I was curious just to ask about some of the underlying metrics - small business volume growth, enterprise transaction growth. We did some slowdown there in Q2, probably more than can likely be explained just by leap year, so was hoping you could unpack those a little bit in terms of where you saw some of the softness. Was it certain verticals or higher income versus lower income consumers, and then just anything you can give us on what you\u2019ve seen in July so far? We heard from Visa last night about a little bit of softness related to hurricane and CrowdStrike. Thank you. Bob Hau : Yes Jason, good morning. There\u2019s obviously lots of variables in both of those, both for small business and the enterprise business lines. Generally, we saw a bit of a slowing, and in fact through the second quarter, April and May were in line with our expectations, July came in a little bit slower. But I would emphasize that that was in line with our expectations, so it\u2019s partly why we\u2019re maintaining our full year organic growth rate at 15% to 17%, and in fact for the merchant segment holding at the 25% to 28% despite acceleration in easing of that transitory benefit down in Argentina. Generally, the business is performing at or better than we had previously expected outside of that slowing in the transitory benefit, which by the way, we think is a good thing for the Argentine economy. A more normalized growth rate in inflation and interest is good long term, and so we\u2019re encouraged by how that\u2019s going and how the overall business is responding. Frank Bisignano : Yes, maybe I\u2019d make a couple other general macro comments. One, when you looked at--you know, we\u2019re very, very proud of what we believe we\u2019ve created with the FSBI and our ability to track it. Obviously we talked about how our numbers don\u2019t exactly mirror the FSBI because of our international presence and the fact that we have verticals that we think outperform. We see a slowness in July, but we see growth in July as we look at it right now. It\u2019s in line with really Q2 if you look at it, and slightly ahead of June. I think also as you look across our book and our total portfolio, you\u2019ll also see the slowing in credit originations across our book which covers retail private label and general purpose, but all of this within our expectation range. I\u2019d also make a secondary point around volume and revenue. We are no longer a volume-only shop. We have lots of VAS, both at the enterprise level and at the SMB level, and it really was the design of how to proceed. We have great feeling about our ability to grow merchants globally, and that\u2019s inclusive of the U.S., so that all falls into our expectation set and I think in total when you look at the business performance and the portfolio size and scope, our hedge is very, very strong. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to hit up on CashFlow Central, just given it\u2019s about to go live here. It\u2019s six large clients you mentioned. In terms of the monetization, I believe it\u2019s a combination of subscription fees and then also transaction fees, including some interchange revenue potentially. I was hoping you could break that down a little bit more, and then also talk a little bit about how the revenue will be recognized across the two segments. Thanks a lot. Frank Bisignano : Yes, maybe I\u2019ll elevate it a hair, just so we have pure clarity on our SMB strategy here, both with FIs and on our other direct channels. We referred to it in our prior comments, but I want to be very, very clear - first of all, those wins are large institutional wins before the product\u2019s in the market in that fashion, and our pipeline is tremendously strong. Remember, we\u2019re also going to bring this product to Clover, and we\u2019re bringing the product to our ISV channels also. Then what we talk about is, as I like to call it, an SMB bundle. That SMB bundle will include Clover, CashFlow Central, the ability to integrate that information, bring it to Active D, which is also winning heavily in the market right now as our new digital banking platform, and Spendlabs. So I think what you\u2019re going to find--and banks, FIs love the bundle, right? Yes, they\u2019re buying CashFlow Central, but this will be a long-term growth engine, and you also heard us talk about our ability to go yes, we have 900 financial institutions, we plan on continuing to grow that number. CashFlow Central by itself is a standout product, which Bob will walk you through the economics, but I want you to focus on the SMB strategy that is an integrated strategy. I think we\u2019re one of a kind in the ability to deliver digital banking, deliver card spend, deliver Clover, and deliver something like CashFlow Central AR/AP to this SMB set. Our banks are loving it. We\u2019ve got two shots at helping our banks generate revenue through it. I didn\u2019t want to minimize the question without articulating the strategy, which is a long term growth strategy for our total portfolio. Bob Hau : And Tim, I\u2019d say we feel very good about signing up six large banks before we\u2019ve gone live. We\u2019re quite encouraged on the demand from those financial institutions and the excitement they have. As Frank points out, it\u2019s a revenue generator with them, it allows them to bring themselves closer to their small business client, which is an important client base for them, and for us, the opposite of our consumer bill pay solution which is a fee that the banks pay us but typically do not charge consumers, and so it\u2019s an expense item. For CashFlow Central, it\u2019s actually a revenue generator - they\u2019ll likely charge their small business clients a subscription, again generate revenue for themselves and obviously for us as transactions flow, so feel very good about the opportunity and very encouraged on the very, very early read. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : Yes, hey guys. Thanks, and nice job. I guess my question, in the banking sub-unit, you grew 4% ex periodic revenue. That\u2019s the best we can see in the six quarters or so since you\u2019ve given the new segment data. Is there something about the market that\u2019s getting better or something that you\u2019re doing more specifically, and is this higher level sustainable? Frank Bisignano : Yes, maybe I\u2019d cover that. I realize in my comments about business generation and demand, I didn\u2019t include that we see large demand for our services out of the financial institutions, and that\u2019s beyond this merchant and CFC capability, which both have tremendous demand. It goes to [indiscernible], which is winning the marketplace. You heard us talk about our Finxact wins. Our clients are growing, and you can look at things that we\u2019ve done on Finxact with one, which has been a tremendous opportunity. I do think, you know, and you could point to recent surveys published that we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves in the service area from where we might have been a couple years ago with the delivery of a commitment tracker, which allows us and our clients to have 100% synchronization on our commitments and our delivery rate. I think those have really, really distinguished ourselves. Our relationship management model is making a difference and will continue. Demand is strong, so I think it\u2019s all those variables that gives us confidence about our ability to be the grower that we talked about to you back on i-day. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks guys. If we could just hone in and just give a little bit more of a broad update on the financial solutions segment, just given the strength we\u2019re seeing, obviously CashFlow Central is strong and then you have Zelle and some other implementations. But help us understand the driving forces of that growth going from where it is today, and then I know you\u2019ve talked about it accelerating again into--like, through \u201925 and into \u201926 at your investor day. Is that still what you see happening, and what are the major drivers affecting that? Bob Hau : Yes Darrin, so our expectation, our outlook for this year for the financial solutions segment is 4% to 6%--excuse me, 5% to 7%. Year to date, we\u2019re at 6%, so we\u2019re right at the midpoint of that full year outlook. We anticipate as we go into \u201925 and \u201926, our medium term outlook for the financial solutions segment increases a point to 6% to 8%, so 5% to 7% this year, we\u2019re right at midpoint halfway through the year, and we expect that to accelerate into \u201925 and 2026. That\u2019s really driven by the benefits of exactly what you called out - CashFlow Central coming online, growth in XD, our digital banking solution, Finxact, and a broad suite of capabilities that we have continuing to take hold and meet the demands of our financial solutions client base. We also have on the issuing side, as you heard us talk about back in November at the investor day, several large client wins that will go live in 2025 and beyond, things like Verizon and Target and Desjardins all giving us a lift, so we feel quite good about where we are first half of the year and what we see going into \u201925 and \u201926. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey Frank and Bob. Really nice results. I just wanted to go back to the more sort of guidance in merchant and macro - I mean, pretty impressive results despite, I\u2019d say, the more muted tone at Visa yesterday. Can you maybe provide just a little bridge in terms of what needs to happen for the guide, or the fact that you maintained the guide for the year? Is there anything--is it all idiosyncratic wins, etc., which is what we suspect, or is there anything else in there? And again, congrats. Bob Hau : Yes, thanks Dan. Overall, maintaining our total company organic growth at 15% to 17%, in order to do that, we expect the merchant segment to grow 25% to 28% organically first half of the year. We\u2019re ahead of that slightly at the top end, good growth overall. We talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about the easing of the transitory benefit of inflation and interest. You\u2019ve seen in our slides that that number has come down. Our previous expectation for the full year was that that would provide a 14-point benefit to merchant solutions, now a 9-point benefit, yet we\u2019re maintaining our full year outlook, and that\u2019s the strength of things like Clover selling very well, value-added solutions both in our small business and in our enterprise business. CommerceHub continues to see good uptake from our large enterprise clients. We definitely saw an increase in anticipation activity down in Latin America we talked about in our prepared remarks, as well as an additional quarter benefit of D\u00f3lar turista, so maybe a little bit of that idiosyncratic view from your point on the D\u00f3lar turista, expect that to go away at the tail end of this quarter, third quarter, but generally, growth across the business. I think this is one of the hallmarks of Fiserv over the 40 years that we\u2019ve been in business, anticipating that 2024 will be our 39th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. We are incredibly resilient and we respond to changes in the marketplace. We respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment and it\u2019s the breadth and depth of our capability, of our product set, of our client base and our distribution channels. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great, thank you very much, and thanks for all of the color and detail here. I want to go back to Clover and Clover growth. One of the questions we get a lot is you talked at your analyst meeting back in November about using Clover and how the back book could contribute a little bit more going forward to that growth. But I\u2019m wondering if you can talk to a little bit the sale cycle there and where your existing customer is seeing value on Clover, and how you\u2019re feeling about that and maintaining those customers from a competitive standpoint, if they are re-evaluating solutions, etc. Thanks a lot. Frank Bisignano : Thanks Jim, good to hear from you. You know, we\u2019ve been really, really feeling good about the Clover strategy and continuing to refine it. Obviously we know there will be a day where we\u2019re going to come back to you and say, we hit it directly into the back book, but we see so much front book activity opportunity between our international, between our ISV, between how we\u2019re thinking about the verticals like services, like restaurants, that we\u2019re continuing to build that product set, that VAS. Obviously it\u2019s an outperformer in attrition across the total book, and we have the benefit of looking at attrition rates from everything. We look at them from what our ISO portfolios are attriting versus our ISV portfolios attriting, versus our agent versus our direct book, and we feel really, really good about how it\u2019s performed. We\u2019re continuing to ramp up our investment in value-added services and vertical expertise there. We\u2019ve made a set of commitments - you know, 3.5 and then 4.5 and pen rates, and you know, we think about the merchant business being $10 billion, then $12 billion, and all of those feels really, really tight and on track. Obviously--you know, I always have to say we started Clover with seven engineers and three [indiscernible], and now we\u2019ve got a global franchise, so it\u2019s straight in our sites. Obviously we have lots of other great things in our portfolio, but it also is a key to why we have 900 financial institutions, and I would expect over a period of time on this journey that if you ask me, we haven\u2019t ever made a commitment or guided to any financial institution, but you should expect us to continue to grow that at a double-digit number every year. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful, Jim? Operator : For our final question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about M&A, and I guess specifically given the valuation, multiples on the public company side seem to be much lower than on the private side. Does that tilt the opportunity set for you guys more towards acquiring public peers? Would you have an appetite to move in that direction, Frank? Frank Bisignano : Well, I don\u2019t--you know, it\u2019s not like I think about public-private. I think about--first of all, we have a tried and true capital deployment philosophy, which I think we\u2019ve been performing well at. I frequently say, gee, I wish we had acquired more, and I frequently--and I always say, but there\u2019s nothing that traded that I wish we had acquired, so I think it\u2019s about value, it\u2019s about long term value creation. Remember, we have the best distribution with our financial institutions, our ISVs. Our ability now to take financial products and bring them to our merchants - you know, we didn\u2019t really talk about embedded finance at all today, but that is still an engine that\u2019s moving for us. It\u2019s where is value creation, how do we bring it to our clients and our shareholders, and I\u2019m really not thinking public versus private as much as being involved in looking at everything humanly possible. That would be--I think that\u2019s kind of where we are. Frank Bisignano : I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their attention today. Obviously we\u2019ve got a great IR team, so reach out to them with any further questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell : Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to the earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon, signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways : through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple, Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance. Bob Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, d\u00f3lar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of d\u00f3lar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the d\u00f3lar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from d\u00f3lar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the update here. I want to ask on enterprise. It did accelerate nicely more than the transaction growth that you put up there. So, I heard, Bob, you mentioned it was transitory part of it and then there was a PayFac conversion to a retail relationship, it sounds like. So, can you just maybe go through that and what's a good sustainable level as we think about the fourth quarter? Bob Hau : Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to \"more normal levels.\" Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Guys, thanks. And nice results. Can we just start with -- overall the business is showing really strong signs of cross-sell. And I know, Frank, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks and how you're really packaging together more and more between segments. Maybe just some very specific examples of where you see that shaping up? And then, just if you could reiterate your conviction around the Financial Solutions segment accelerating into '25. I think you said going to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. Just reiterate why and what the driving force is and what you're seeing? Thanks, guys. Frank Bisignano : So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Harshita Rawat : Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about STAR and Accel, especially given some of the changes happening in the U.S.? Maybe talk about their PINless capabilities [indiscernible] Signature capabilities, how STAR is positioned to grow? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on Clover. I know revenue growth was steady here, volume growth ticked down a little bit. Just any thoughts on Q4 expectations for those metrics? I think the volume comps get a little bit harder, revenue also next quarter. So, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about near-term trajectory there. I know you've got some new country launches, product launches to support it. Bob Hau : Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess, my question, in the SMB segment, for many quarters, you had kind of teens growth, kind of 13% to 17%. This quarter was 9% despite Clover being in the high-20%s for many quarters in a row. So, maybe what -- kind of what's happening outside of Clover, and then how should we expect that to reaccelerate going forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that? Bob Hau : Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I also want to revisit the Financial Solutions revenue guidance for next year, which is set to slightly accelerate, so from 5% to 7% this year to 6% to 8% next year. When we think about the reasons, there appears to be a good long list of very clear bullets. So, there's the Target business, there's Desjardins, there's Verizon. I believe all of those are expected to go live with their incremental revenue streams next year. And then, of course, there's the CashFlow Central. So, I was hoping you could touch on or maybe elaborate on any of those particular projects and/or maybe just talk a little bit about the confidence that you have in that reacceleration for next year? Frank Bisignano : Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Great results again. Frank, Clover Go and Clover Compact, they look like great solutions from micro sellers. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on the strategy and in terms of initial traction that you see on these new products? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Thank you so much. I wanted to follow-up on the SMB bundle and this ties a little bit into Dan's question, but it seems like there's a lot of capability expansion that's happening within the Clover ecosystem and then looking at new ways to go to market. How should we be thinking about -- I know you gave some targets for back book and some of those things to get to the $4.5 billion target, but how should we be thinking about like the roles that those will play and if there's been any change in your thinking in terms of mix or type of customers and such within that Clover target? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there. Operator : Thank you. And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Clover international expansion, how long does it take to ramp a new country or region from the time you enter the market to when you reach peak run rate? And also, should we expect sort of a steady rhythm of new markets for a while here, or are you going to kind of -- should we expect some pauses where you build out and sort of spool up in the countries you've already launched in? Frank Bisignano : Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Julie Chariell : Welcome to the Fiserv Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv, Inc. Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mike Lyons, our new president and next CEO. To the call, Mike. It's great to have you here. Frank Bisignano : Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today. We wrapped up another successful year at Fiserv, Inc., and one that we are all very proud of. We set high expectations back at our 2023 investor conference and we exceeded those commitments. Fiserv delivered adjusted earnings per share of $8.80, up 17%, driven by strong and diverse revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 39.4%. Total company organic revenue growth was 16%. Our free cash flow was $5.2 billion and we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase in 2024. Throughout the year, we advanced multiple strategies and product offerings that take advantage of the unique construct of this company with strong assets across merchant and financial solutions. We added large enterprise clients, both traditional and e-commerce merchants, on the strength of our unified offerings, modern gateway, and growing value-added solutions portfolio. At Clover, we laid the foundation for continuing our strong growth as we released new software, services, and hardware offerings and added three new countries. We extended merchant acquiring services to more financial institutions focused on winning small business clients. We built solutions to help SMBs navigate the complexity of running their businesses. Managing cash flow in particular is one of the biggest challenges. It's ineffective, time-consuming, and expensive. Cash Flow Central is our solution to this problem. We completed development of this new offering in the fall. Demand from FIs to offer it remains high. Cash Flow Central is a full small business suite, the single integrated easy-to-use system that SMBs have been looking for. The products and clients for this SMB suite span our merchant and financial solutions ecosystems, a combination that no single competitor has in a solution that no single competitor can offer today. From the merchant ecosystem, we provide Clover payments, hardware, and software, CloverVass, including vertical software solutions, capital, employee customer and operations management solutions, and the small business index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide Cash Flow Central, Optus for business card issuance, SpendTrac for expense management, Zelle for small business, and core banking account management and digital banking. The full SMB suite will be integrated this quarter with XD, our digital banking platform, which is already live for an implementation with hundreds of FIs. It will be available directly on Clover late this year. Lastly, we continue to be a partner of choice in real-time payments enablement with Zelle, PIX, and FedNow. And in our core modernization strategies, which include FinFAC, for simplified technology migration, for our existing FI clients as well as new and larger FIs and embedded finance pioneers. We capped off all this progress with the naming of our next CEO, and we did it in trademark Fiserv style. Swiftly, efficiently, and with an extremely high-quality result. We announced Mike Lyon as president on a Thursday and he started work here the following Monday. That's the kind of urgency and determination that we bring to our work at Fiserv, Inc. It's the speed of execution and the operational excellence that I've committed to you for the last few years and that will continue under Mike's leadership. I know this not only because of what I've seen since he started, but because we have experience working with Mike over the last twelve years. As you know, Mike joined us from PNC, a long-standing Fiserv partner, and one of the nation's largest and strongest banks. Since he started, Mike and I and the full leadership team have been working tirelessly to ensure a smooth transition. Let me hand it over to Mike to say a few words. Mike Lyons : Thanks, Frank. I'm thrilled to be here. I've known Fiserv for a long time, wearing a number of different hats, including as an investor, a banker, a large client at BofA, and PNC, and a small client at my wife's business where she has been a Clover customer for years and utilizes it to its fullest. Fiserv is an amazing company with an outstanding track record of growth, innovation, operating efficiency, and importantly, the proven ability to add value for our clients and create value for our shareholders. After just a week on the job, my excitement in being here has only grown stronger. The talent and work ethic of the team, the breadth and quality of our clients and partners, the products, the distribution and technology, and the ideas and opportunities. I couldn't ask for a better platform to build upon. Right now, our number one priority is to ensure a smooth leadership transition, keeping everyone laser-focused on executing our plan that Frank and the team laid out in late 2023. I believe strongly in that plan as it offers significant growth opportunities by meeting the needs of our merchant and financial institution clients. Fiserv has a very impressive thirty-nine-year track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth that is matched only by the opportunity that lies in front of us. I look forward to meeting you all to discuss this in the coming months. As Frank mentioned, we've worked closely and effectively together for the last twelve years and I've had a front-row seat watching him and the Fiserv leaders build this incredible company. I thank both Frank and the board for the opportunity to lead Fiserv into its next year. And, of course, we all thank Frank for his future service to our country. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Mike. Now I'd like to cover some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year. And then I'll turn the call over to Bob to discuss the numbers. The growing connections between businesses and financial institutions are a key part of the Fiserv story. And our ability to address them makes Fiserv unique. Embedded finance is the most complete use case from merchant issuing and banking assets combined. And last quarter, we announced our first large-scale win here with DoorDash. To offer its delivery contractors full banking services from within a single app. Our cross-platform capability and FinZAC as a real-time ledger are true differentiators for us here. We've been executing with speed and quality and have already onboarded a significant number of accounts and cards since the October announcement. And our pipeline of other embedded finance opportunities continues to grow. We reinforced our position as a partner of choice with the Q4 signing of a key strategic partnership with ADP. Together, we serve millions of small businesses and now we'll bring them a full solution that includes Clover, our cloud-based point of sale and business management platform, and Cash Flow Central, our accounts, payables, and receivables management platform. Integrated with ADP's run, its industry-leading small business payroll and HR solution. Essentially, ADP will be the integrated payroll solution on Clover, and ADP will resell Clover and Cash Flow Central. The integrated solution will make it easier than ever for small businesses to manage the flow of money into and out of their businesses. Whether they are selling to customers, paying bills, or managing payroll, in Q4, we initiated mutual client referrals to our respective offerings as our teams work to deliver the fully integrated solution in the coming months. For the last few quarters, you've heard me recount how as old as new again, as financial institutions are reinvesting in the merchant acquiring business, especially for SMB merchants. Right now, sweet spot. The address there needs we've seen acceleration of outsourcing of financial institutions as merchant acquiring referral partners. In 2024, we added 65% more bank partners than we did in 2023. Including NBT, a $14 billion New York-based bank, we are approaching one thousand financial institutions as merchant partners with significant opportunity to drive further penetration within our existing FI partners. While others offer merchant acquiring solutions, only Fiserv can deliver a higher SMB integrated solution including Clover. The full suite gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With his knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients. And generate deposit and noninterest fees. This year, we'll couple this capability with tools to help FI's readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. We had several other key wins in each of our businesses in Q4. In Merchant Solutions, CloverSport notched multiple venue wins. One with TD Garden, home of the Boston Celtics and Bruins. And another with the Milwaukee Brewers. We placed over a dozen Clover Kias in Katy Garden that have increased speed of sales and improved the SAN self-checkout experience. At Clover Restaurant, a major hotel operator, chose custom website solutions from Bento Box for their two thousand hotel-based restaurants in the US. This is the fourth large hotel chain to sign on for the Bento digital and e-commerce package. In the enterprise space, clients continue to sign up for Commerce Hub. Our API-based orchestration layer that connects businesses to our enterprise product suite and value-added solutions. In Q4, AT&T decided to add a data as a service offering. While large, petro company signed on to add paid by bank and Transamer fraud protection. Merchants overall are increasingly recognizing the importance of payment data to drive business decisions. And Fiserv is uniquely positioned to deliver cross-platform datasets to support their business intelligence security NAIN. We are driving our enterprise solutions further into government with Tyler Technologies. An integrated software provider. We signed a strategic expansion of our relationship that supports processing for state governments. To include all omnichannel solutions more devices including Clover, and value-added solutions such as digital wallets, fraud mitigation, and authorization optimization. E-commerce providers are increasingly coming to Fiserv as well. We fully ramped our US relationship with PayPal in the fourth quarter. And when ONTU signed PayPal and Latin America, for payment processing and other VATs. We also landed Leap Financial, a fintech firm focused on international remittances and embedded payments that will add commerce and we'll be providing card not present acquiring and debit routing optimization for the mortgage operations of Bilt. The loyalty rewards platform for housing payment. And finally, curb mobility. A leading taxi and mobility services company, decided to migrate to Commerce Hub. Herb will be our first client to deploy Android Tap to Pay enabling drivers to use the Android device that runs their driver app as payment accepted devices as well. This will significantly reduce their cost for dedicated In taxi terminals, hardware, and maintenance. In EMEA, Fiserv reached a first-of-a-kind opportunity in Spain with Unikaha, one of the country's leading banks. We signed a strategic agreement to work together to develop advanced solutions in payments and e-commerce. Including tools for omnichannel processing and point of sale systems in response to growing market demand in Spain from merchants of all sizes and in all verticals. And we saw further traction in Spain in January with Rio Hotels where we will be providing Clover Flex terminals and card present acquiring across their hotels in the US and Canada. In the financial solutions segment, we saw several large core banking wins. South State Bank, a now $65 billion Florida-based regional bank, on our premier core, plans to add approximately $20 billion assets to the platform following its recent acquisition of Independent Bank. Modernization via our DNA core continues as well. With our new relationship with third federal savings and loan, a $17 billion asset bank headquartered in Cleveland. This next momentum is clearly building. According to analysis performed by Prometic global consulting firm. FinTech has more accounts in production and clients in the US than all other next-generation competitors combined. Speed to market, is one important reason we win. In just ten months, we powered the US super app of Brazil-based Banco and Terra to support international debit and money movement. Investing loyalty points and cash back. And for DoorDash, we enabled access to sponsor bank accounts and real-time payment for DoorDash delivery personnel in just a few months. FinZAC was chosen by FirstRand Group. To power its digital transformation and ongoing growth objectives. First ran. Is one of the largest banks in Africa with over $130 billion in assets. And will become the first financial institution outside of the US to select our cloud-native real-time banking platform that offers enhanced access to data. Cash Flow Central had a very strong Q4. Signing twenty-nine banking clients for a total of thirty-nine since we launched. Some of the biggest in Q4 included BMO Harris Bank, a Fannie Federal Credit Union, UMB Bank, and City National Bank of Florida. Cash Flow Central is starting to pull through Other sales, including Checkfree and XD. Overall, 2024 was a strong year with important signs of continuing success based on the development and early uptake of many new products designed to be easy for clients to adopt and integrate on our leading platforms. Compared to the guidance we had laid out, at the start of 2024, our final results have beaten on adjusted operating margin adjusted EPS, and free cash flow based on strong execution. While we met expectations with 16% total company, we full year organic revenue growth. If we exclude transitory factors from margin Yeah. Hello company organic revenue growth in 2024 was 11%. A healthy and sustainable level. For the full year 2024, we returned value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $5.5 billion or thirty-four million shares contributing to a nearly 5% decline in average shares outstanding for the year. Today, we are sharing a plan that continues down the path We said at our investor conference in November 2023. For 2025, we are guiding the 10% to 12% organic revenue growth. Greater than 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth and roughly $5.5 billion of free cash flow. This guidance assumes zero contribution from transitory factors as Argentina's economy stabilizes. With 85% recurring revenue in our model, natural operating leverage, ongoing efficiencies, new products, continually invest and healthy cash flow. We are well-positioned to extend our lead and to shareholder value and deliver a fortieth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. So is that I'll turn it over to Bob to cover the numbers for the quarter and full year 2024. And some details behind the 2025 guidance. Bob Hau : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover the detail on total company and segment performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide four. The fourth quarter capped off a year of strong revenue growth whether you look at the numbers as reported or on an organic basis, or even if you exclude the transitory benefit of inflation and interest, in Argentina. The quarter also featured significant ongoing margin expansion and improved free cash flow. Total company adjusted revenue grew 7% while organic growth was 13%. Driven by strong double-digit growth in the Merchant segment and mid-single-digit growth in financial solutions. The spread between these growth rates reflects currency translation. Excluding the transitory effects of excess inflation and the Dollar Treester program in Argentina, total company organic revenue growth would have been 11% in the quarter. Total company adjusted operating margin reached 42.9% an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. And an adjusted operating income growth of 11%. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.51 up 15%. For the full year on an adjusted basis, revenue grew 7% to $19.1 billion Total company organic revenue growth was 16% representing our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic revenue growth. Most of the difference between adjusted and organic growth rates came from the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso through September and broader dollar strength in Q4. For the full year, if you were to organic revenue growth would have been 11% for the year. Adjusted earnings per share was $8.80 At the top end of our guidance range, which we raised every quarter last year, Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion and $5.2 billion for the year. This very strong free cash flow included a positive impact from a working capital improvement project that we kicked off in Q3. We improved processes around both payables and receivables and the benefit accrued sooner than expected. We expect this improvement to be sustained in the future. Turning to our performance by segment, starting on Slide six. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, which 23% in the quarter, and 27% for the full year. Excluding the transitory effects of excess inflation and the Dollar Tree store in Argentina. Organic growth would have been 17% in the quarter and 16% for the year. On Slide seven, we have again included a summary of the contribution from excess Argentine inflation and interest and the temporary dollar tourista program. Along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation which impacts adjusted revenue for both the company and merchant segment revenue. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 24% and 12% respectively. On payments volume growth of 4%. Clover revenue reached $2.7 billion in 2024 with nearly 90% in our small business line reporting. Clover revenue grew 29% in both the quarter and full year on Q4 annualized payment volume growth of 14%. This spread reflects growth in value-added solutions, some targeted value-based pricing actions, and strong hardware sales. In 2024, we rolled out five new hardware products that gained traction, particularly in our ISO channel, and among bank partners investing in the merchant acquiring businesses. VAST penetration continued along its path of roughly three points of growth per year, reaching 22% in Q4. Driven by continued growth in Clover Capital, and the enhanced Clover SaaS package. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 31% driven by transactions growth of 17%. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise included great benefit. From Argentina in the fourth quarter. Above-average enterprise growth also reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from a processing customer to a direct client. Which started in earnest in Q3. For the full year, enterprise growth of 31% organic and 12% adjusted includes the impact of ramping growth from the large PayFac client we mentioned last Quarter? As well as the transitory effects from Argentina. Commerce helped continue its positive momentum roughly 250 clients and daily transactions up tenfold since Q1 of 2024. Through a single API integration, Commerce Hub clients can access a variety of solutions including fraud and security, routing optimization, pay by bank, and data analytics. And we continue to add to this portfolio. We found that on average after one year, Commerce Hub clients take over four BaaS products, or 60% more than non-Commerce Hub merchants. For our largest commerce hub clients, product attach is even higher approaching five solutions per merchant. Finally, partially reflecting the relocation of the large payback to our enterprise segment, as a direct client. So for the full year, processing organic revenue declined 1% consistent with our expectation of roughly flat growth over the medium term. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 15% for the quarter and 20% for the year. Merchant adjusted operating margin expanded 290 basis points to 37% in 2024. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest cost from anticipation were included in operating income, merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 120 basis basis points for the quarter, and 230 basis points for the full year. Turning to slide eight on the financial solutions segment. Organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year, at the midpoint of our full-year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% and 6% for the year. Growth in Zelle revenue reached a strong 28% for the year and we are now supporting Early Warning Services newest offering, the digital wallet pays. This is a clear example of the value Fiserv can bring at integration of financial and merchant solutions. We both enable banks to offer pays to customers and integrate the Pays wallet as a payment option on our enterprise and Clover merchant platforms. We also continue to see demand for our integration on the FedNow for real-time payments. With nearly 400 of our FI clients enabled or in process. Many seamlessly thanks to our existing integration with our NOW network. In Issuing, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter and 7% for the year. Below trend growth in Q4 mostly reflects the timing of plastic and statements volume. Banking organic and adjusted revenue each grew 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. In line with our expectations. Adjusted operating income for the financial Solutions segment was up 10% for the quarter and 7% for the year. With full-year adjusted operating margin reaching 47.3% a 130 basis points improvement. Now let me wrap up our 2024 discussion with some remaining details on the financials. The adjusted effective tax rate was 18.8% for the full year. This came in slightly lower than expected on benefits of our Green Tax Credit Program. Total debt outstanding was $24.8 billion on December 31st. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio edged a bit lower to 2.6 times in the fourth quarter in line with our targeted leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased six million shares for $1.3 billion bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the full year to $5.5 billion Average shares outstanding declined nearly 5% in 2024 as a result, and we had eighteen million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Turning to slide ten, we are setting our full-year 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance. To a range of $10.10 to $10.30 representing 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth. Our organic revenue growth guidance of 10% to 12% is at the high end of our medium-term target range and consistent with our organic growth in 2024 excluding the transitory contributions from Argentina last year. Given the current macro environment in Argentina, we are assuming no contribution from excess inflation or interest in 2025. And an end to the Dollar Tree store program in the first quarter of 2025. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange is 1.5% in 2025 compared to 9% in 2024 Since the Argentine peso devaluation is expected to slow, as is the recent U. S. Dollar strength. This will bring adjusted revenue growth much closer to organic growth in 2025, and similar to a historical average spread. Our adjusted operating margin expansion outlook of at least 125 basis points is ahead of our prior target of at least 100 basis points annually through 2026. And we expect our free cash flow to be about $5.5 billion Drilling down by segment, for Merchant Solutions, we see organic revenue growth of 12% to 15% in 2025. Driven mostly by strong growth in Clover, as we reach our $3.5 billion revenue target including an increase in VAS penetration, to the 25% outlook. Our ability to achieve these goals is to supported by opportunities we advanced in 2024, with five new hardware rollouts, new features and functionality for our three focused verticals of restaurant, services, and retail. In three new geographies, Brazil, Mexico, and Australia. We expect the small business line to grow above segment average driven by Clover, Enterprise should be slightly below the segment average to more normal levels following the end of transitory benefits in Argentina and some one-time revenues associated with the large PayFac win. In the processing line, we see modest positive growth as we anniversary strategic shifts of certain clients in 2024. We will see an impact of the reduction of the Argentina transitory contributions More prominently in the first and second quarter this year, as they are tougher compares to higher benefits in the first and second quarter. Of last year. In financial solutions, we anticipate organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% All parts of this business are expected to contribute with new revenue as we go live with Target and Verizon in issuing, embedded finance with DoorDash, several Fin's XD migrations, and early adopters of Cash Flow Central. The issuing and digital payments business lines should grow at or slightly ahead of segment growth levels. While banking grows a bit slower than average given the nature of the business line. While we don't give quarterly guidance, think it's instructive to consider the quarterly cadence this year. Overall, we expect growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Several reasons for this. First, we've had multiple new product rollouts in late 2024 that we expect will gain traction over time in the market. From Clover vertical software to Cash Flow Central, and the SMB suite. Second, we had several important new wins that will take time to implement and generate revenue. Including Target expected to go live in late March, and Verizon in September. Third, we entered three new countries with pilots in the fourth quarter, and full-scale go-to-market efforts just getting underway. This year, and lastly, the contribution from transitory items in Argentina was highest in the first half of 2024. Creating tough year-over-year comparisons for the first half of 2025. Q1 is a particularly difficult growth comparison from one-time dollar to each revenue. And a LATAM processing client term fee in Q1 2024. So while we see better second half than first half growth, we have strong visibility and have confidence in the drivers of our full-year organic revenue growth. Lastly on guidance. Both merchant and financial solutions are expected to contribute to the at least 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion that we are forecasting for the total company this year. Below the line, we see higher interest expense in 2025 due to refinancing and ongoing growth in the merchant cash advances. Our adjusted effective tax rate should be roughly 19.5% And we expect to continue our share repurchase program with spending ahead of free cash flow. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano : Thanks, Bob. Those of you who know us, know that we are passionate about small businesses. In Q4, we partnered with the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Providing valuable insights on the impacts of hurricanes, Elaine, and Milton to guide response, invest We are undertaking similar efforts in Los Angeles as we speak. All based on the data captured in the Fiserv small business index. We also have people on the ground offering assistance To all of our clients including small businesses, And to readily address this in future disasters, we have created a $10 million relief fund to support clients and employees as needed. Last week, Fiserv was again named Oh, world is our tenth in the last eleven years. And we are proud to have moved higher in our ranking specifically in the areas of quality of product and service and quality of management. We're gratified to consistently rank highly on two other measures. Innovation and long-term investment value. Which I believe are inextricably linked. In reality, a single ranking or even multiple awards or recognitions that we've earned can capture the true value of our company. You've often heard me speak. About the unparalleled assets of Fiserv. How scale broad product set, vast distribution, innovative technology, global presence, Deep bench and unique combination of diverse merchant and FI clients and solutions. I'm very proud of the strong returns we have delivered on these assets. And grateful to the team around me to their talent and support. The board our management committee, and Fiserv associates. As well as our clients partners, and investors who I've had the privilege of sitting down with over the years. Ultimately, Fiserv's success comes down to one thing, You've heard me say it over and over again. The construction of the company. That can endure and transcend CEUs. On December fifth, I told you we would name a great CEO in a short period of time and then I'd be working every day meet financial commitments. Now two months later, you can see that we've delivered. I give you my full commitment to be working side by side with Mike. Pending the outcome of my nomination. So now, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. As a reminder, for today's call, please limit yourself to one question to ensure ample time to answer as many questions as possible. If you would like to ask a question, you may press star one on your phone. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much for taking my question. I have to ask a question for Mike, glad to have him on the call, of course. Just I'm curious to hear your response to, you know, what surprised you about Fiserv as you did your diligence to join the company, what was different from maybe what you thought Looking at it as an investor and, of course, as a client and partner. Mike Lyons : Yeah. That's the question. Great to hear from you. That's been a long time. You know, my relationship with the company goes back many years. They said it's both an investor and as a significant client. And then as a with all the work we did at Zelle and Pays and it's an unbelievable company, obviously performing at a very, very high level as you can see today with visible revenue, cash flow, and earnings growth. So weren't a lot of surprises that it's a terrific franchise. I understand it. I understand the plan that we have in place. I firmly believe. In that plan. And our big focus internally with the team and we've been going hard since last week, is to make sure we don't miss a beat on the execution of the strategic priorities is a long list of really exciting growth opportunities both on the merchant side of the business the financial side of the business. The scope and potential of that set of opportunities and the ability to cross-sell across the two platforms. It's probably if there's anything in the last eight days, still early, it's probably that that's an unparalleled opportunity that I hadn't I hadn't had full appreciation of. I've gotten here. What we have, the potential on international, was also surprised. And then I've had over again, it's only been eight days, but I have a chance to spend time with the team deeper into the organization. I'm incredibly impressed by the talent innovation especially the amount of people focused on innovation You talk about thirteen thousand engineers most of whom have reached out and expressed their excitement for the future. And even over the last seven or eight days, have had ten or twelve client meetings and we've got incredible clients and our ability to you know, help them navigate both an evolving and exciting payments world is, again, unparalleled. So I said high-level stuff. Obviously, have more as we go to Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : I guess we'll just start off with Clover. I mean, the sustainability of the growth has been outstanding. And so when you look at the trend line into next year, even against tough comps, Just remind us of what you expect the more nuanced building blocks that can keep that afloat at that level. Which I know it kinda needs to be to meet your targets. And then just thinking about VAS and the cross-sell, considering what you have in terms of new direct sales and new Internet give us a Once again, revisit the building blocks for the sustainability. Nice guys. Frank Bisignano : Yeah. Maybe I'll take it. Right? You know, I'd start with You know, I was down like I told y'all, I was going to Brazil I was on my way back from the launch in Brazil, and the president said there's no doubt. Gustavo and I spent time in With the president of Brazil, he was so enthused about how small business and efforts. So you go Brazil, Mexico, or Australia, all of coming online. I think the ADP partnership, you know, Maria Black got a job a year ago. We spent time She's a fabulous leader. She saw the opportunity we saw the opportunity, you think about you know, when you wanna talk about a back book, let's think about ADP's back book. Right? That's a hell of a back book and a front book. You know, we talk about these nearly thousand FI partners you know, we you know, kinda what I love saying. That was old, but it's new. You know? I mean, we're you know, with the integrated suite of cash flow central, bringing all the other tools, expense management, Spendtrend, attach it to XD. You know, it just gives us this unbelievable opportunity to continue you know, we think we're the heavyweight champ of the world that partnerships. As I always say, partner of choice. Whether it's ADP, whether, you know, it's with a great top ten bank last night. You know, Mike and I. You know? So demand is super high, and I think every FI partner we're building tools to increase penetration in every FI partner. And then you look at, you know, all the things that we're bringing in new software, you know, besides you know, Cashflow Central, e d p, more website management, more employee management, more capital, You know, we rolled out we had a great year rolling out a Five you know, new products. So, you know, we're all gassed. No break on this baby, and that's kinda how we're playing it. You know? And we love it. And, you know, like, I will just I'll make a statement, you know, I'll make the statement. I make the statement everywhere. Mike is crushing it. So there's no pivot going on here. You know, we're not rethinking but he's gonna be better than me. He's gonna be better than me for fifteen reasons, you know, including not a pandemic and not a merger and all gas, no break, fully fully in integrated team. Everybody loves Mikey. That's it. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you and congratulations to Mike as well. On DoorDash, so big contract and certainly supports the acceleration in financial solutions this year. And you mentioned a pipeline of other embedded finance, opportunities. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the Payfair acquisition and how that plays into that I gather that it brings on program management capabilities and previously Fiserv working with smaller third-party program managers, and now you have that in-house. Maybe just talk about what this means for The revenue opportunity, not only with your existing clients, but also how it might help you help you with some of those RFPs particularly in light of those. Comments around the pipeline. Bob Hau : Yeah. Tim, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. And you're right on the mark. Obviously, we feel great about landing and very rapidly accelerating our position with DoorDash getting up to a full ramp in just a few months, That's going quite well. Program management is certainly part of the overall program with DoorDash and with embedded finance clients. We do some of that in-house. We partner with third parties. It's a combination. And Payfair will bring some additional capability to us around that aspect. That transaction's not yet closed. But we feel like that's a good add to the overall capability that we have And if you think about what an embedded finance client would need, Really don't think there's another company that has all the assets available within our own shop to really fully serve those clients. Think that's why DoorDash selected us and why we feel like we're in a great position to continue to see that space grow for us. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Congratulations, Mike. Bob, can you talk about January trends? Are you seeing kind of Bob Hau : Sure. I would say that obviously what we're thirty-three days into the first quarter in line with our expectations off to a good start from an overall consumer spending standpoint, consumer continues to do well and remain resilient. We certainly benefit from having the breadth of our capability Serving discretionary as well as non-discretionary categories A lot of folks talking about experiences, and, obviously, we participate in that also. So generally feel good about our ability to continue to grow nicely as we see consumer spending going on and leveraging our very broad distribution channel and variety of verticals that we serve. Obviously, a lot going on in the world. And we've seen FX ease quite a bit. I see that going on in 2025. You heard us talk in our prepared remarks 2025 outlook is much lower. That, of course, does play into that volume. That volume is a reported number. We don't adjust it for FX. We also don't adjust it for the inflation and interest rate dynamic that we saw down in Argentina. In 2024. And looking forward to not talking about that in 2025 as that has now returned to more normal levels. So bottom line, feel good about where we are. January is continuing with similar trends we saw in the fourth quarter and excited to get the year going. Thanks, Harshita. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : And I guess my question is within Financial Solutions, issue or slow, do you talk about that a little bit. Was that I guess, was that because financial solutions product revenue was really strong in Q2, Q3. It that fallen issuer and maybe that's why it slowed a little. And then when does that pick up? When does, like, Verizon etcetera target kinda hit in 2025 to reaccelerate that? Bob Hau : Yeah. Overall, fourth quarter, I would probably attribute the slowdown yourself particularly in the issue of space. That's where our print and plastic business reports and so we saw some slower volume in that space. And I think that's tied to the overall credit environment. For next year for 2025, we see target coming on in very late first quarter, late March. Verizon will come in in September. And the other product, large project that we've been talking about in the past is Desjardins. That will actually come to fruition in 2026. So we'll see an uptick late March, obviously, as that ramps throughout the second half of the year. And Verizon will benefit us as it ramps into the fourth quarter. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Great results. Great year. Congrats again, Frank. So on can can we talk strategically a little bit about your Walmart partnership? Like, how do you envision this, you know, very exciting using the now now network and FedNow and all these things to actually, you know, maybe change the way people pay Any any early observations from your conversations there would be really helpful. Thank you. Frank Bisignano : Let's take the macro. You know, I mean, I got to first data. Two thousand Thirteen. And Walmart At that point, was thinking about, you know, multiple providers and other things and We've had a tremendous partnership. We continue doing more with them. I mean, look at Washer Running, you know, their JV of One Financial on Finscag, you know, which I always believe, you know, if we are able to service You know, Walmart on FinZACT that and you hear us talk about is going on, you see First rant, you know, as a client there coming on, you know, So we continue to have an extraordinary relationship Remember, we have a team that sits in Vintech. Right? You know? I mean, that's just that's just an extent of that relationship. We have one executive in charge of it. We meet all the time. I meet with the leadership of on the payments, Mike, you know, obviously understand my clients understand, you know, Walmart inside and out also. So, you know and we're we're generally working side by side with them on any initiatives they have in the space of payments or fintech you know, you know, we're generally focused on our clients and serving our clients. We're not really selling anything to our clients. We're partnering with my, like, Walmart So line up with their strategic initiatives way before a rollout. So, I mean, I can't stand up about them as a client. But I'd say, no, our client base. Is unparalleled. Right? I mean, from, you know, we could go through the client base and it could be, you know, even a small community bank or a good community bank somewhere in America. You know, we have lots of them. And we partner with them. It's why we have a structure of coverage the way we do. Why we strongly believe in relationship management, You know, Walmart's a twenty-seven-year relationship. So I can't I mean, it's not about one initiative. It's about and it's not about one client. But they are a fabulous client, great partner, and and they're they're also a strong client, you know. They don't They want they they want and deserve superior product and superior service. Yeah. We meet regularly. It's a great relationship. Thanks for asking. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Congrats Mike. Congrats Frank. I wanted to ask on Clover. Just Bob, you mentioned that spread between the revenue and the volume growth. It did widen out a little bit, and I know you talked about the vast penetration. The pricing, and the hardware sales. I was hoping you could maybe break down the contribution to the spread among those three, and then any thoughts on how that spread may evolve in 2025? Thank you. Bob Hau : Sure. Thanks, Jason. I think, you know, overall, the The list that you just had is kinda where we are from a ranking standpoint. Fast is certainly continuing to improve, expand, We'll see that actually continue into 2025 where we expect to hit 25%. Fast penetration good growth in 2024, three points over the previous year. Hardware, given the fact that we rolled out five new pieces of hardware, saw a very nice uptick, in that space. The kiosk, the Clover Flex, FlexPacket, etcetera, all participated in helping drive additional hardware. We're also seeing more uptick in that from our financial institution clients investing in the Clover capability. And then from an overall mix standpoint, more direct is giving us great opportunity going forward. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Good morning. Congrats to Mike and Frank, wanted to ask quickly about the go-to-market on a lot of these new offerings. It seems like a lot of attractive potential for your financial partners to engage with small businesses further with the new offerings. We're pretty excited about those. But wondering how we should think about go-to-market support for those, what the implications for operating expenses are, and what kind of proof points we should be watching to see as your financial partners start to engage and roll out Thanks. Frank Bisignano : Yeah. He's saying, Joe. When we lay all this out, obviously, we're adding to our sales force. Right? And we love to add to our Salesforce. So that's a real positive. You know? We also have worldwide distribution. So our ability, you know, to get product out, we have a very, very structured way to deal with our partners that's been tried and true. Start with how much distribution we got Right? Like, that was really a distribution channel than a distribution partners. Right? So it it it it it you know, as we like to say, what's old is new. You know, we're just coming back to using our distribution capability, add more sales. Obviously, we're also gonna have more digital capability of distribution this year than we had last year. And we're adding more salespeople, you know, in this street, across the board. You know? So I think I think there's a it it sounds like a lot. But a lot of it's integrated. A lot of it's technically integrated. We're doing a very good job whether it's on ADP or Cash Flow Central. To have deep technical integration. And, you know, ultimately, a bank partners, you know, wanna help us, and all these things, there's more revenue for that. Right? So, you know, when you think about Clover growth, when you think about cash flow central growth, would you think about ADP, know, deeply technically integrated, We're adding speed on the street. Bank partners love it because it's revenue to them. All our partners use ADP with you know, these are revenue-sharing agreements. Everybody is incented to, you know, grow these products. So nothing really new there except more technically integrated than ever before. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here and nice to meet you, Mike, over the phone. I wanted to ask about Cash Flow Central at you give us your latest thoughts, Frank or Bob, on when it will become a material contributor to the P and L? Will it gain enough momentum to be felt in 2025? And also just help us understand the sort economic model there as it dips on volume, fixed fee, subscription fee. How do you actually price the thing? Thank you. Frank Bisignano : You know, meetings in a twenty-plus billion dollar company has a lot of variability on how people mean meaningful. But we'll you know, in the second half of this year, you know, our clients are gonna be online and we expect to book our revenue. I think you've seen meaningful the way Physic Nano thinks about meaningful. It's more like you know, twenty-six, not twenty-five. But, you know, this has long-term sustainability, durability, and, you know, like, my and I and, you know, like, we sit around and talk, and it's fun to be doing this with them because he's under the under the hood, Frank Day is and, you know, Moses, we believe that, you know, our ability to grow the company in total It is it is just as much as we can consume because we're continuing to you know, and I said this a long time ago to y'all. When we laid out targets a long time ago, we continue to add TAM. Opportunity. So, you know, I think on the specific question, It's you know, you'll see numbers starting to run up in the second half. I would consider it, in my language, meaningful. Right. In twenty-six, And I think we're not limited to that opportunity, you know, always a depth showman growth drivers a company that you heard in might you know, his own words and when he sat in an all-day management meeting on the first on last Monday, and we go through the business plans and look at the opportunities. You know, and that's why we able to post the numbers we post. It's land of opportunity. I hope that's helpful. So thank you for your attention today. Reach out to our IR team. I hope to just talk to all of you. And like I like to say, I'll be here till I'm not. But Mike and I are side by side. They wanna let me say that earlier, but saying it now. A great day. Fine. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call.
