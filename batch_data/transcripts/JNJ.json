All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing first quarter results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide commentary on the results including some highlights for the quarter, a review of the income statement and guidance for 2014. We will then open the call to your questions. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your model. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Also, please note that we will be using a brief presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide lists acknowledgment of those relationships. Now, I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.1 billion for the first quarter of 2014, up 3.5%. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3% and currency had a negative impact of 1.8%. In the U.S., sales were up 2.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.9%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 3.4%. On an operational basis Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 10.3%, the western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 7.1% and Europe grew 6.6%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products made strong contributions to the results in all regions. Turning now to earnings, our earnings were $4.7 billion, up 35.2% compared with the 2013 results. Earnings per share were $1.64 versus $1.22 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of approximately $300 million for after tax special items. First quarter 2013 net earnings included a net charge of approximately $600 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.54, representing increases of 7.8% and 6.9% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the translational impact of currency. I will begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion decreased 0.6% with U.S. sales down 2.9% while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.7%. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, both worldwide and U.S. growth were approximately 1%. Major drivers of the results were skin care and oral care offset by the divestiture of the North America women\u2019s health business. Skin care results were driven by AVEENO and DABAO new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns. Oral care results were driven by results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. OTC sales were negatively impacted by a weaker cold and flu season partially offset by strong sales of ZYRTEC with the U.S. launch of the Dissolve Tabs including sales related to the initial stocking. Moving now to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide net sales of $7.5 billion increased 12.2% with the U.S. up 7.7% and sales outside the U.S. up 16.9%. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2013, U.S. results included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates under the Affordable Care Act related to new data received from the states. The most significant impacts from the adjustment were in immunology, neuroscience and PROCRIT. Excluding this item, 2014 worldwide sales were up over 15%. In addition, in the early part of last year, the company made certain supply chain changes for REMICADE, resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales now being recorded as international sales. Adjusting the 2013 base to reflect this impact as well as the U.S. managed Medicaid adjustment, the first quarter 2013 U.S. pharmaceutical segment U.S. growth was over 19% and growth outside the U.S. was approximately 12%. Pharmaceutical growth was driven in part by a recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and SOVRIAD in Japan, contributing over 5% to the worldwide pharmaceutical growth versus the first quarter of 2013. Other significant contributors to growth were ZYTIGA, XARELTO, STELARA, INVOKANA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION partially offset by lower sales of CONCERTA and ACIPHEX due to generic competition. The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic, castrat-resistant prostate cancer market combined with estimated market growth of 10%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 34% of that market. The expansion of the label to chemo-na\u00efve patients and continued progress and reimbursement drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries. XARELTO sales doubled compared with the same quarter last year and grew nearly 18% on a sequential basis. Total prescription share or TRx at the end of the quarter in the U.S. oral anticoagulant market grew to 12.5% with cardiology TRx estimated at nearly 22%. INVOKANA sales contributed 2.5 points to U.S. pharmaceutical gross rate, and at the end of the quarter achieved 2.1% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 6.6% by the end of the quarter, up over 1% sequentially. Continued momentum and market share for STELARA complemented by strong market growth drove results in immunology while increased market share drove results for INVEGA, SUSTENNA or XEPLION. I\u2019ll now review the medical devices and diagnostics segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostics segment sales grew 1.8%. U.S. sales declined 1.6%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 4.6%. Growth was driven by orthopedics, specialty surgery, vision care and cardiovascular care, partially offset by lower sales in diabetes care and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Lower price primarily related to competitive bidding continued to impact the diabetes care business in the U.S. Orthopedic sales growth was driven trauma, knees and hips. Trauma was up 7% with the U.S. up 10%. In the U.S., strong market growth and the positive impact of the recovery from the prior year nail recall was partially offset by pricing pressure. Knees worldwide increased 3%, with 2% growth in U.S. and 6% growth outside U.S., driven by the successful launch of the ATTUNE Fixed Bearing Knee, partially offset by price pressure across the region and softness in the U.S. market. Hips growth of 2% worldwide was driven by nearly 4% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Specialty surgery growth was driven by new products launched and market growth in our worldwide biosurgery business and energy business outside the U.S., as well as strong sales for both infection prevention and MENTOR products. Vision care sales growth is primarily due to a customer inventory build anticipated to reverse in the second quarter. Cardiovascular growth was driven by 15% worldwide increase in our Biosense Webster business due to new catheter launches and continued market expansion. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Thanks Louise and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2014 and I believe we are well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. As Louise did, I have also added a few slides to accompany my remarks, which we hope you will find helpful as you are following along on the webcast. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance and then provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2014. But before I do that, I want to comment on what we are seeing in the market for healthcare. The early first quarter data we\u2019ve seen so far shows continued softer utilization trends impacted by the severe winter conditions. The data we have shows continued slight declines in the rates of surgical and lab procedures in the United States, similar to what we saw over the past 12 months. Additionally, the strong fourth quarter utilization in orthopedic procedures softened in the first quarter due to some seasonality as we and many of you had expected. Overall as economic conditions continue to recover and given the positive demographic trends, we remain confident about the long-term health of the market. And at Johnson & Johnson we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities of achieving our financial targets, restoring and re-launching our U.S. OTC products, continuing to capitalize on the potential of DePuy Synthes and building on our strong momentum in pharmaceuticals. At the same time, we also continue to make good progress on our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed in detail during our January meeting. During the quarter, we had several key developments across our three business segments including key regulatory milestones in the pharmaceutical and medical device segments and I will mention a few of them here. In the pharmaceuticals segment, these included several CHP recommendations for approvals in Europe for simeprevir, siltuximab and VOKANAMET. VOKANAMET is a fixed dose combination product of canagliflozin and metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As well, we received FDA approval for the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. And in the MD&D segment Biosense Webster received FDA clearance for the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH, the first catheter ablation therapy to feature direct contact force technology for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. During the quarter, we accepted The Carlyle Group\u2019s offer to purchase our clinical diagnostics business and we expect that transaction to close towards the middle of the year. We also made decisions regarding our consumer portfolio, as we have signed a definitive agreement to sell global rights for the K-Y brand to Reckitt Benckiser. If you turn to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter. As Louise has already covered our sales results, I will review some other key points on the balance of the statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. We are pleased to report adjusted net earnings of $4.4 billion, which are up 7.8% over the first quarter of 2013 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 versus $1.44 a year ago, up nearly 7%, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates that\u2019s published by First Call. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net after-tax gain of approximately $300 million or special items, which consisted of the following. A charge for in process research and development related to the discontinuation of the development program for PureTox, continued cost associated with the integration of Synthes and finally during the first quarter, a capital loss was realized for tax purposes on the sale of shares associated with Conor Medsystems, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $400 million. The value of the Conor business was previously written down for books purposes. Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I am pleased to point out that we saw very good operating performance in our results. Cost of goods sold at 30.1% of sales was 160 basis points lower than the same period last year. Included in last year\u2019s cost of goods sold was the inventory step-up associated with the Synthes acquisition, which we characterized as a special item. Excluding this, cost of goods sold was lower by 80 basis points, reflecting the mix of our results this quarter which were driven primarily by our pharmaceutical business as well as cost improvements across many businesses. This was partially offset by the impact of the weakening of the Japanese yen, which we discussed as a headwind for 2014 although that negative impact of gross margin will increase throughout 2014. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28.6% of sales or 120 basis points lower as compared with the first quarter of 2013 again due to the growth in our pharmaceutical business of new products and overall good management of cost primarily our MD&D businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.1% at a similar level as we saw in the prior year, as we continued to make important investments for the future. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items was 31.2% or 200 basis points higher than the prior year, a strong performance early in the year, but not fully reflective of the investment plans we have for the remainder of the year, more of a headwind related to the weakening of the Japanese yen as I noted earlier. Interest expense net of interest income of $118 million was slightly higher than the prior year period due impart the higher average debt levels. And other expenses net of other income was a net charge of $86 million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $515 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line item, other expenses net of other income was actually a gain of $32 million compared to a net gain of $83 million in the prior year period. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 20.4% compared to 19% in the same period last year. This effective tax rate is higher than our guidance for two reasons. First, it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that legislation has not yet been passed. And secondly, the mix of our business this quarter, which reflects a higher portion of our earnings from the U.S. driven primarily by the success of our new pharmaceutical product launches. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult to forecast, beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $12 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $17 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items and litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting 2014 other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $600 million to $700 million, this is consistent with our previous guidance. And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress, although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. This guidance is higher than our previous guidance reflecting a change in the mix of our business resulting at a higher portion of our earnings in the United States. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year. Now turning to sales and earnings. As I noted earlier, we have received and accepted a binding offer for our Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business of approximately $4 billion. We expect the transaction to close mid-year that the resulting gain will be treated as a special item. As of today we are considering how to best allocate the net after-tax proceeds from the divestiture. As is our practice with acquisitions and divestitures, we will update our guidance after the transaction closes to reflect the impact this divestiture could have on our sales and EPS excluding special items for the remainder of the year. Therefore, our guidance today will not include the impact of this transaction. However, at this time we believe that any such impact will be certainly absorbed within the range of EPS guidance we are providing today. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in January. Let me just review those briefly now. Those key assumptions are for sales our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2014 and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year. And as for earnings there are several factors to note. First some comments about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation, which I will discuss later. As we highlighted in January, the Japanese yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the U.S. dollar and the euro in 2013. The impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results was not significant because of our policy of hedging foreign currency transactions 12 to 18 months in advance. However, the impact of the devaluation is a significant headwind in 2014 and our 2014 guidance reflects a negative impact to gross margin of approximately 60 basis points or a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.11 per share. In the event of a significant devaluation of any other major currency such as the Venezuelan bolivar, we will look to mitigate that impact depending on the magnitude of that impact. However, such a potential devaluation of the bolivar or any other currency is not reflected in our guidance. We also expect continued pricing pressure in 2014 across many markets, particularly in Europe. The impact of this negative pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our pre-tax operating margin by approximately 50 basis points. So, as we\u2019ve done for several years now, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As of last week the euro had strengthened versus the U.S. dollar as compared to 2013 average levels. However, many other currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar such as the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real as compared to their average levels for 2013. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase like constant currency basis of between 5% and 6% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant currency basis of approximately $74.9 billion to $75.7 billion. We\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales of currency exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week. Our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 0.5%, plus under this scenario we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4.5% and 5.5% for a total expected level of reported sales between $74.5 billion to $75.3 billion, which is higher than our previous guidance. Now turning to earnings; our earnings guidance reflects the major assumptions I noted earlier and reflects the strong performance we saw in the first quarter and our plan to continue investing in future growth. Considering those factors, we suggest that you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.74 and $5.84 per share on an operational or constant currency basis. And again we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share if exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week then our reported EPS excluding special items would be positively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share due solely to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS excluding special items in the range between $5.80 and $5.90 per share or growth rate of between 5% and 7%. This is higher than our previous guidance. As you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a stronger improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels than we have previously expected, although not at the level we saw in the first quarter, despite the negative impact of the devaluation of the yen on our gross margins and the expected pricing pressures. This is due to the strong performance of our business, primarily driven by new product launches and continued management focus on our operating expenses. You should also see that our net income margin will expand, despite the increase in our effective tax rate. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter of the year. The breadth of our business, which provides balance and consistency to our overall performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our talented people around the world positions us well to sustain and drive growth throughout the year. Thank you. And now I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the program. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. Stephanie, could you please provide the instruction for the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And your first question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Dominic Caruso : Good morning Mike. Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan : Thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Dominic, if I take you back to three months ago at the analyst meeting and in also subsequent call on February, I firstly will get on the sales guidance for the year and I think I have talked at the call that you\u2019re being conservative and now you've come in here and you reported a better than expected first quarter and you raised your guidance for the year. So can you talk a little bit about from the January call to to-date what has increased your confidence? And how much of that is from OLYSIO which obviously had a much strong quarter this quarter? And can you talk about that product\u2019s performance and ability? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure Mike. Well, you're right. You did challenge us on that presumed level of conservatism. I would say just as a way of background, we are trying to forecast new product sales in a dynamic healthcare environment and we are also trying to forecast various economic trends and utilization rates in the marketplace. So we do our best to give you our sense for what we are seeing at the time. What we are seeing now is a better overall sense of the launch, particularly the launch of the new products within pharma. And OLYSIO as you pointed out has done remarkably well. Yes, it\u2019s done better than we expected. It\u2019s primarily due to the fact that the Liver Society issued guidelines in January recommending the use of OLYSIO along with the product from Gilead, Sovaldi. And that has been adopted by the community, by the medical community as a standard of care based on the liver guidelines of the society of liver specialist guidelines. So that\u2019s something that we learned after our guidance. We saw it take off and we are very pleased with the results. And if you look at the total increase in our sales guidance, which is about roughly $1 billion, I would say the majority of that is due to the fact that OLYSIO now is performing much better than our earlier expectations and we are very pleased with that. And obviously more patients are gaining the benefit of utilizing this new therapy. As far as sustainability is concerned, I think you know that there are competitive products on the horizon. The goal of searching for interferon-free therapy seems like it will be a reality. And there are products that are expected to be approved later this year. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see whether those products are in fact approved. And then of course we\u2019ll reassess the long-term outlook for OLYSIO given any new product or new competition. And just as a reminder, we are also studying OLYSIO in a Phase 3 clinical trial along with Sovaldi. So we\u2019ll have that data after that trial is concluded and that will give us a better idea of the overall sustainability as well. Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan : Okay. And Dominic just one follow-up on the EPS guidance for the year; it\u2019s sighted to me what you were saying the FX line that there was going to be a $0.06 of earnings pushing your upside based on real time FX rate [if you\u2019re able] to hold that you are not including in guidance. [So I just wanted that] right? And two, I assume that would offset the impact of the OCD divestiture, is that [a very little up there]? Dominic Caruso : No Mike, let me just reiterate that. So the $0.06 that I referred to as the benefit from exchange rates versus last year is related to simply we gave guidance on an operational constant currency basis of $5.74 to $5.84, but then when you consider the uptick in exchange rates particularly the euro that will benefit that constant currency range by $0.06 and therefore we\u2019ve increased our guidance by that $0.06 to $5.80 to $5.90 or a midpoint of say $5.85 compared to the midpoint in January of $5.80. The overall increase in FX impact between those two guidance points is only about a penny, it was about $0.05 in the January discussion and just about $0.06 now. Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan : Got you. But the OCD piece is (inaudible) cadence absorb that dilution or do you expect to when that occurs? Dominic Caruso : Yes. We expect that given the strength of the business today and the range of guidance we\u2019ve provided assuming that transaction closes at mid-year, we believe that any remaining negative impact from not having those earnings for the balance of the year would certainly be absorbed within the range of guidance we\u2019ve now just provided for earnings per share. Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Dominic Caruso : Welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Matt. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: So Dominic on the SG&A, usually it looks like the first quarter does start low as a percent and then it gets higher during the year, but you are starting at a much lower base this year. Is there anything particular this quarter or is the cost cutting and expense control going to be lower this year, as you move through the year, even though the percent goes up? Dominic Caruso : Yes. I think a couple of things, one is we\u2019re starting the first quarter with tremendous growth from new product launches in pharma. They don\u2019t have a pro rata increase in SG&A from the prior year. Secondly, we have implemented some cost reductions and combined some businesses in the MD&D sector of our business to better compete in the current dynamic marketplace. And thirdly, we do have a number of programs as we\u2019ve talked about before and Alex spoke about in January the overall streamlines of operations; and not only reduce some cost, but also get more focus and more simplicity and agility into our operations. So I think all of those things will help and would result in SG&A being lower this year as compared to last year. Although, as you pointed out that we haven\u2019t yet invested everything we would like to invest for the balance of the year. So my guidance does include the fact that we would ramp up some investment in the balance of the year, which is not yet included in the first quarter results. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: And just quickly on Europe, you grew it looks like organically around 7%. Can you just say [probably] was that mostly driven by pharma or did MD&D consumer do okay in Europe; how is the Europe trending in those businesses or how was it in the first quarter? Dominic Caruso : Yes. I think that we obviously benefited from strong growth of new product launches in Europe in the pharmaceutical business. I don\u2019t think there was anything in particular to point out in any of the other businesses. There is nothing like substantially positive or negative in the Europe business [that is] primarily driven by the pharmaceutical launches in Europe. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Thanks Dominic. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Kristen. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. I was just wondering if you could just explain the tax benefit associated with Conor Medsystems; what way that was I guess included within this quarter\u2019s results? Did you do something (inaudible) part of that business or\u2026 Dominic Caruso : Sure. Kristen, well just to remind you, we excluded it from our ongoing operating results. So, it\u2019s the earnings excluding special items of a $1.54 exclude this benefit, just to be clear. It\u2019s reported in the overall GAAP results of a $1.64 that\u2019s primarily why the GAAP results are higher. So that business was the business we acquired for the next generation of drug eluting stents several years ago. And we pulled out of that business, we wrote down the assets associated with that business previously. And when we took that write down for book purposes, we also excluded that from our ongoing earnings and recorded it as a special item. Now what happened in this past quarter is the underlying shares of the business that we bought, we bought the stock of that company, we sold that company along with its related intellectual property. And as part of that sale, we recognized for tax purposes a capital loss. That capital loss generates as you know a tax benefit. And so we thought it would be prudent to record that tax benefit as a special item because it essentially offsets the previous write down for book purposes which was also special item. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And the sale was this quarter; and can you comment who you sold it to? Dominic Caruso : We did sell this quarter; and no, we are not going to comment on who the sale was to. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then can you maybe just provide a little bit more color just in terms of what you were seeing within the medical device business? I know you commented on lower utilization trends but then also commented on expectations I guess for things to improve within orthopedics but any additional color just on the U.S. markets? Dominic Caruso : Sure. So, what we saw in the U.S. markets, as I commented in my script was a similar type of year-over-year decline in the rate of utilization, particularly hospital admissions as well as lab procedure. So, these have been trending now for the past year or so at minor downticks in quarter -- year-over-year growth in the quarter or depression in utilization from the prior year. So we saw that continue in the first quarter. With respect to orthopedics in particular, we did expect, I think many of you all expected that the higher utilization in the fourth quarter was a result of seasonality, primarily related to the health plans and also probably some influence from the Affordable Care Act rush to get coverage in some, maybe some confusion over what was happening in the marketplace. So in particular, the orthopedic trends did slowdown in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And we saw this very same phenomenon a year ago. So, it\u2019s now become quite a seasonal business from that perspective that we see a real uptick at the back end of the year and then a slowdown in the early part of the year. The only other thing I would say that in the medical device business more broadly we did see some softer trends in elective procedures we think in the U.S. that\u2019s probably due to the severe winter conditions, so we don\u2019t have any exact data on that fact but anecdotally that\u2019s what it appears, has impacted utilization rates in the first quarter or slightly as far as the data we have is concerned. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Larry. Dominic Caruso : Hi Larry. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe for Dominic or Louise, you guys have a pretty robust late-stage pharma pipeline again, I count 6 phase, 3 products right now. Could you maybe talk about the key pipeline milestones we should look for in 2014 on the pharma side? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well Louise, maybe you can help me with any particular milestones we have. So, we have -- well we obviously have IMBRUVICA for example has a number of new indications that we\u2019re studying, some have already been approved as you know. But there is a series of new indications being studied for IMBRUVICA and hopefully we\u2019ll hear some of that this year. Simeprevir is also being studied as I mentioned earlier in the Phase III trial along with Sovaldi. And I don\u2019t know that there is anything in particular that\u2019s a data or a conference where data will be disclosed or provided in the near-term, but Louise, you might have more on that? Louise Mehrotra :  Yes. So we\u2019ve announced that the [resonated] data from IMBRUVICA should be shown in this quarter at ASCO. There is also a significant number of abstracts scheduled to be shown for INVOKANA, but at this point I\u2019m not going to be able to give you the specific confer, because still they haven\u2019t been published at this point in time. We are also leaving for the fixed dose combination with for INVOKANA that would be something to watch out for this year as well. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo :  Right. Thanks that\u2019s very helpful. And then one last question, emerging market growth this quarter, Dominic can you talk about what you saw there or BRIC growth? Thanks and I will drop. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Yes, so for BRIC growth this quarter, we saw about 13% growth in the BRIC markets and for the broader emerging markets about 7% growth. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo :  Thank you very much. Dominic Caruso :  You are welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Dominic Caruso :  Hey Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions, the OLYSIO numbers, was there stocking in that $350 million or $354 million? And I don\u2019t know if you disclose the IMBRUVICA numbers? And then just a question on sort of general pricing that we\u2019ve seen in MD&D, I think you said several times during your prepared remarks that growth in orthopedics was offset by pricing pressure particularly in hips and knees. So, I guess sounds like utilization trends have worsened a bit, have pricing trends worsened and what are your expectations for pricing for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Well, Louise has all the facts in front of her. So, I'll let her take that question. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. So, for OLYSIO in the U.S. they only have data for in the U.S. it's about 20% of the sales were inventory build. So the majority of it was certainly flowing throughout out to the patients, which is good news for the patients. Regarding the hips and knees pricing, I can get that number to you. In the -- this is again U.S. commentary, the price change for hips was negative 4.1% in the first quarter, offset by a very modest positive mix to net of the 3.7% negative that is slightly negative versus the fourth quarter of \u201813. We also, for the knees, we have a 2.4% negative price offset by about a 2% positive mix for net of 0.6% negative for knees, which is very similar to the first quarter, the fourth quarter of 2013. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : And what about IMBRUVICA? Louise Mehrotra : So, IMBRUVICA we did report a little modest bit of sales on that, but we are going to leave the IMBRUVICA comment for Pharmacyclics in their call, because it's actually from the U.S. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just Dominic, can you comment on pricing expectations going forward. Do you expect this to stabilize, worsen, get better? Dominic Caruso : Yes. So in January, when we provide the guidance in January, we said that we thought negative pricing pressures particularly in Europe would impact our pre-tax operating margin by about 50 basis points, we still see that. So, we don't think it's gotten any worse. So we're consistently seeing same type of pricing pressure we saw, but we developed our plans for 2014, so no change in our expectation. Louise Mehrotra : So, thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Dominic Caruso : Good morning Glenn. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, good morning guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the comment about U.S. knee softness. So, in February here in the U.S. we did have bad weather and that may have contributed given the fact that you\u2019re still having a very strong rollout. So, I am wondering did you see your volumes even hits to did they improve throughout the quarter. So, in other words February was hit because of weather and then these patients came back in March or if there is a weather impact are we are going to have these patients come back more in the second quarter? That\u2019s my first question. Louise Mehrotra :  So, to frame the weather impact I also want to pick up the additional selling days. So in recon, we have one additional selling day, it\u2019s very specific to recon it does not include trauma. And that pretty much offset the impact of the harsh weather. So net-net there was no impact we believe to the knees and hips because of that combination. But when you look back at when you look at last year seasonality, in knees we had about a 5% seasonality, and in hips we had about a 2% seasonality which is very similar trends to what we are seeing in this quarter. As far as January, February and March we don\u2019t go into that detail of the monthly sales. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And sticking on ortho, can you give us the spine results, you didn\u2019t give us the spine results in your commentary, maybe U.S. and global spine revenues and any pricing commentary? Louise Mehrotra :  Okay. So spine in the U.S. on an operational basis is down about 3%, o-U.S. is up about 4% for a flat on a worldwide basis and in terms of price it\u2019s down, again this is U.S. only, it\u2019s down 3% in price, slight positive mix for a net of down 0.8% in terms of price mix and that\u2019s much less negative than it was in the fourth quarter. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, okay, that\u2019s great. And then let me put in one question just on the fixed dose combination of INVOKANA because I believe you had a complete response letter recently. So, what\u2019s changed in terms of it sounds like you\u2019re a little bit more confident that we may get approval this year. So, I am just curious, was there more data or what\u2019s changed in your view on the fixed dose combo? Louise Mehrotra : For the U.S. we actually resubmitted the response to the complete response in February and we have a PDUFA date in August. Dominic Caruso : Right. And we did get a recommendation for approval of that fixed dose combination in Europe. Louise Mehrotra : That\u2019s correct. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks guys. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome Glenn. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from line of Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Derrick. Dominic Caruso : Hi Derrick. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Going back to gross margins I appreciate some of the qualitative commentary you gave there Dominic on the increase in the impact from the yen moving out to the year. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us a better sense this quarter of what the impacts from the devaluation of the yen was? And also how much of the strength is coming from OLYSIO in the pharma product launches that might sort of carry through the rest of the year? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Sure Derrick. Well, as we said in our overall guidance both in January and today, we expect the impact of the devaluation of the yen to impact gross margins for the year about 60 basis points and I said that it would accelerate through the balance of the year, just because of the way the transactions were hedged. In the first quarter alone we estimate that that impact was only about 20 basis points negative to gross margin. So we haven\u2019t yet seen the full impact of the yen devaluation. And with respect to overall gross margin performance even excluding that primarily driven by the mix of the business because of course our pharmaceutical business is our highest gross margin business and that\u2019s delivered most of the growth this quarter. And yes in fact that growth in gross margin has been positively impacted by the sales of OLYSIO. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. And in the consumer business, that was one area that came in a little weaker than we expected, particularly OTC baby care, wound care were the kind of three categories that just kind of missed our estimates. Just more broadly speaking, I was wondering if you could kind of talk to us strategically about plans to accelerate growth in that business. Can you get that business back up to sort of market growth? And also how can we think about the margins in that business now that it seems that most of the OTC products are back on the market, can we expect to see any sort of margin leverage from that business? Dominic Caruso :  Sure, Derrick. Well, just to give you an overall perspective on the consumer business, as Louise mentioned, the business was impacted by tough comparisons because of the women\u2019s health products that we divested. So, the overall growth excluding divestitures and even excluding some acquisitions that we did was about 1% in the quarter. Couple of things to note about that 1% that last year\u2019s first quarter of the year 2013 was a very strong cold and flu season and despite the severe winter conditions, this was actually a very weak cold and flu season. We think that has overall a point or a point and half of growth impact between the two periods. So, the underlying business excluding those impacts is about 2.5%. We did in fact as you know, launched the products back into the marketplace in early 2013. We\u2019re very pleased with the uptake. It was showing double-digit consumption growth in the products. And of course we\u2019ve launched some new products such as ZYRTEC quick dissolving tablets. So, overall we\u2019re pleased with the progress that the consumer business is making overall. We have great plans in place to launch new products. And overall, the margins as you pointed out, should improve as we complete the work with the consent decree, which we expect will approach completion towards the end of this year or early next year. So after that, we would then expect to see the overall margins improve as the business recovers from that activity and obviously the new products take hold in the marketplace. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Rick. Dominic Caruso : Hey Rick. Rick Wise - Stifel: Hi Louise, hi Dominic. Couple of questions, Dominic just one bigger picture question political turmoil trade issues rising in Russia. Can you remind us what percentage of your sales are in Russia are in that region of the world? And are you concerned -- is this an incremental concern for the rest of the year at all? Dominic Caruso : Sure. So, let me give you sort of a sense for Russia. So, we said that growth for the BRIC markets overall was about 13% this quarter and the growth within Russia was at mid single-digit growth. Now, if I look back first quarter of 2013, our Russia growth was actually negative in the first quarter of 2013. And that has to do with the timing of tenders within the Russian market. So, there is lots of fluctuations. The only thing we have seen so far that\u2019s a little bit of a concern is that, there does appear to be some funding restrictions in governmental buying patterns of respected capital budgets in the hospitals. But overall, it\u2019s not a very significant piece of the overall business. With respect to our total BRIC business, it\u2019s relatively small piece of the business. Obviously China and Brazil drive the majority of our growth and the majority of our business in the BRIC markets. Rick Wise - Stifel: Okay. And one other question Dominic, I mean with the sale of diagnostics, it\u2019s hard not to reflect on the rest of the portfolio and look around for other underperformers and I know you are doing that all the time. But diabetes comes quickly to mind, I appreciate that you are going to anniversary the price cut in this summer, maybe in the third quarter. But maybe talk about the diabetes outlook, what changes as we get pass that anniversary? And are you taking a harder look at underperformers like diabetes. Do you need to be in this business longer term for the rest of the franchise or is this something that maybe you could carve out at some point? Thanks Dominic. Dominic Caruso :  Okay. Sure Rick. Well, just a few comments on diabetes overall and our approach to portfolio analysis. Alex, as you may remember has been very clear about some of the criteria we use to analyze the portfolio. One criteria is are you number one or number two in your market or do you have the technological wherewithal, the technology et cetera, new products that could propel you to that number one or number two spot; and lastly, are you complementary to any of our other businesses. So, with respect to diabetes, despite the significant pricing pressure in the market overall, all companies have faced this, diabetes business is a market leader. They have very strong market share positions, the business is doing very well outside the U.S., continues to grow nicely, and also it is very complementary to other parts of our business. We attribute the successful launch of INVOKANA partly to the fact that we have very good relationships with the endocrinologists as a result of our Life Scan business already. So, at this point, we haven\u2019t made any decisions with respect to any other portfolio of choices, but the diabetes business is well positioned overall in the marketplace and it is complementary to significant part of our other business. Rick Wise - Stifel: Okay. Maybe just to follow-up Dominic, I apologize, with $3 billion in cash and significantly more likely all things equal by year-end, any updated thoughts on capital allocation, acquisition or share buyback? Thanks so much. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Rick. So, just to correct you, I think you said $3 billion in cash; it\u2019s actually nearly 30. Rick Wise - Stifel: 30. Dominic Caruso : Yes. Rick Wise - Stifel: Okay. Dominic Caruso : Well, no change in the way we look at it. We\u2019ve been very consistent with this approach. We think that looking first at our dividend and we\u2019ll obviously know more about the dividend at the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in a couple of weeks. After that, we look to invest for growth and for value creation so that we\u2019re appropriately generating returns commensurate with the risk associated with putting our investors\u2019 capital to work. And then finally after exhausting those possibilities, we then look to share repurchases if they\u2019re at the right time. So no change in our overall approach, we think it\u2019s a very good approach. We consistently follow it; it\u2019s proved to be successful in overall balance of both returns to shareholders and investing in growth over the long-term. So as of now no changes in our approach and nothing else to report. Rick Wise - Stifel: Thanks. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Louise Mehrotra : Hey Matt. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Hi, thanks. So, just one follow-up detailed question here that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve provided and then I have a question on consumer. So, in your remarks Louise, I think you had not covered the trauma detail, I\u2019d love to get some color as to exactly to what happened there. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. So, the U.S. growth is 10%; the OUS growth is 4% for a total of 7% operational growth. In terms of the pricing, pricing was about 0.7 negative in the quarter and that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve actually seen that. It was more than offset by a positive mix of about 2.5%. So net-net, the pricing mix in the U.S. was about 1.8% stable, which was slightly favorable versus the fourth quarter 2013. Dominic Caruso :  Now, one thing I would like to add to that is I think that the trauma team has done a remarkable job recovering from the nail recall that happened. And so they deserve to be congratulated for bringing the product back to the market. And of course patients are better forward and our customers should have the confidence in us to be able to do that and we\u2019ve demonstrated that their confidence is well earned. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Great, thank you for that. And then on consumer, I guess we didn\u2019t spend much time here in Q&A talking about it, but that had been topic of some discussion over the past couple of years. And you made some changes there and then you announced this licensing arrangement around K-Y. I\u2019d love to get a sense may be strategically how you are thinking about that business particularly as it relates to that $30 billion and obviously $30 billion in cash that you have outstanding there. Dominic Caruso :  Sure Matt. Well, just to clarify with consumer, we basically -- we did enter into an agreement to sell the K-Y brand to Reckitt, and that transaction should close in the second quarter. That was a strategic portfolio decision. We\u2019re looking at the portfolio and consumer as we look at the portfolio in each of our businesses and obviously through the filters that I just described earlier. And with respect to the utilization of our cash, the consumer business like any of our other businesses, MD&D or consumer competes for capital in the same way. We look at strategically where we should be investing the capital and then of course whether or not that allocation of capital will give us an appropriate rate of return given the risk involved. So, it doesn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t treat the businesses any differently except for a change in the risk adjusted rate of return that\u2019s required based on the obvious risk involved that\u2019s different between the businesses. So, there is no specific plans with respect to the $30 billion as I mentioned earlier in answer to Rick\u2019s question. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Can I push you just a little bit on that Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : I thought I remember there was a time when we thought of consumer pharma, MD&D as kind of a three legged stool and consumer kind of being the shorter leg of that stool. Is there still thinking that you will work to try to make this some more balanced divisional portfolio? Dominic Caruso : So, let me just comment a little bit on that Matt. When we look at the three-legged stool, we\u2019re thinking of a broadly based healthcare business across many aspects of the healthcare marketplace both consumer medical devices and pharma. The relative percent that each of those businesses represents as a percentage of the total and the pie if you will is really the result of decisions previously made. There is no forward looking predetermined mix that we think is appropriate. Each and every investment is evaluated on its own merits and the mix today is 40-40-20 is the result of making the investment decisions we\u2019ve already made. So, as we make other investment decisions with appropriate risk return profile, that mix might change, but there is no predetermined picture of the pie that we think is ideal. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Helpful. Thank you. Dominic Caruso :  Okay. You are welcome. Louise Mehrotra :  Next question please? Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning Jeff. Jeff Holford - Jefferies:  Hey, thanks for taking my questions. So just a bit more color on OLYSIO. Can you just give us a bit more color on the usage of this product, do you have any information about how much of it is being used in combination with which products? Secondly, I don\u2019t know if I have heard you breakout INVOKANA sales yet, if you can give us any color either on the actual sales or how much it contributed to growth as you have done previously? And then just lastly, if you can update us on the reexamination of the REMICADE patent and just what kind of visibility you might have out there on a potential timeline for biosimilar introductions? Thank you. Dominic Caruso :  Sure Jeff. Well with OLYSIO as I mentioned earlier, the guidelines from the Liver Society was very clear that recommended usage in conjunction with Sovaldi, the new product from Gilead. We did see sales tick up right after those guidelines were issued. So we don\u2019t have all the specific information that I could share with you now but we do believe a large majority of the sales are in combination with Sovaldi and apparently in an interferon free regimen. I am going to skip INVOKANA and let Louise talk about that. There is nothing we can report on the examination of the REMICADE patent, no new information. And with respect to biosimilars, we don\u2019t really see any biosimilar impact in the U.S. And we have seen biosimilar impact outside the U.S. but it\u2019s been very modest with REMICADE from the product that has been approved to-date which is called what, Louise? Louise Mehrotra :  Ready (inaudible). Dominic Caruso :  Yes. But it\u2019s very, very modest. And I think that has to do with generally speaking, biosimilars are not expected to have the dramatic impact of change in the marketplace as you see in small molecules for a number of reasons that I am sure you\u2019re aware of. And with respect to INVOKANA, Louise? Louise Mehrotra : So, in my prepared remarks, I said it contributed 2.5 points to the U.S. growth rate. Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you very much. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome Jeff. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Danielle. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners : Good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to if I could follow-up on Rick\u2019s question regarding capital allocation and more specifically focus on M&A. Dominic, I know you\u2019ve touched on it a few times this morning. But I guess specifically, not really related to predetermined mix of businesses but where do you see the most meaningful areas of interest for J&J, the highest growth profiles of markets where you\u2019re not currently participating and how do you see deals going down from here on out, knowing that Synthes was the largest acquisition ever but it looks like you\u2019re largely integrated at this point. So, any more color there, what markets are interesting to J&J that you\u2019re not participating in and sort of how big of an acquisition would you guys make from here on now? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Well Danielle, let me just comment a little bit on our strategy. So again, we want to participate in the fastest growing segments of healthcare and we want to do so in a meaningful way where the asset would be better in our hands as opposed to the hands of the current owner. But having said that, regardless of the growth trajectory of the market or the asset, evaluations have to be right. So today for me to give you any indication on which markets we\u2019d be more interested than others, we sort of leave out the corresponding equally important characterization of whether or not evaluations are appropriate. So, I can\u2019t really comment today on that very specifically. And also with respect to size of transactions, we\u2019ve done hundreds of acquisitions over the last 15 or 20 years and just about a dozen or so have been over $1 billion and very few Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and Synthes of course have been in excess of $10 billion. So, it is pretty rare for us to do a large acquisition like that not because we have any particular pre-disposition to not doing it, but because as I said earlier, the valuation has to be right, the asset has to be better in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner and therefore and obviously the premium to be paid has to be sensible. And then we are already broadly based in human healthcare. So, there are very few areas that we need tremendously significantly greater presence. Having said that, a lot of our capital is in fact allocated to pharmaceutical licensing and collaborations, which we think is an enormous benefit to us because it\u2019s the most efficient allocation of capital. We take some risk afterwards, but we don\u2019t put the capital out on day one. Obviously we do it through the development program that we control. So that\u2019s the way we think about it. I\u2019m sorry; I can\u2019t give you any more specifics today with respect to any markets or specifics beyond what I just said. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners :  No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Dominic. I guess just a follow-up on that specifically to medical device business as you mentioned, recently you\u2019ve allocated a lot of capital to the pharma business, I know that you acquired Synthes that was a big acquisition for you guys. How do we think about the outlook for the medical device business relative to pharma? I mean pharma has really been the engine driving growth for J&J. Is that sort of how the future for the company looks, as pharma will be the engine going forward and devices are there to sort of generate cash or how do we think about how the med-tech business continues to set into broader change J&J\u2019s business? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Okay. So, that\u2019s a great question. So, as you know, we think of ourselves as a broadly based company in healthcare. And you think of the MD&D business we have, we\u2019re the largest MD&D player in the market. So, we obviously have quite a significant presence in the hospitals. And that as you know is a very important part of the overall healthcare system. So, Johnson & Johnson is best positioned in medical device as I believe than any other medical device player given what\u2019s happening in the market with respect to hospitals and specifically speaking the U.S. with the advantage of Affordable Care Act and the accountable care organizations, we\u2019re working to not only remain the largest player in medical devices, but to take advantage of that position in the hospital setting with respect to providing total solutions to the marketplace. So, it\u2019s a very important part of our business. It does drive substantial cash flows to the business. In the past, it\u2019s been a significant contributor to growth from new products. I\u2019m confident it will also be a significant contributor of growth from new products in the future as well. And we have an upcoming Medical Device Business Review coming up May 22 and you\u2019ll hear Gary Pruden and Michel Orsinger specifically talk about the surgery and the orthopedics business and the plans there. And I look forward to sharing that information with you then. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners : Thanks so much. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Josh. Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic, it\u2019s clear that the pharma was the driver for the margin performance in Q1 and also for your updated guidance. And it sounds like consumer; there is some room here as you work through the consent decree and for some margin expansion as well in that unit. Can you speak specifically to the device business and particularly on margins; was it a drag in Q1 or a contributor and then also the outlook for the year here for the device business in terms of margin contribution? Dominic Caruso :  Yes, Josh. Well, we don\u2019t give outlooks or forecasts by business of margin, but I did say that we expect to have overall margin improvement both pre-tax operating margin greater than what we expected when we gave guidance in January, but not to the extent that we saw in the first quarter. And with respect to the first quarter, the SG&A line showed very nice leveraging year-over-year and that was due in part to the pharmaceutical business, but also very much due to the MD&D business. The MD&D business has done a very good job of consolidating businesses, of streamlining operations et cetera. And also in the supply chain, the medical device business has even further opportunity, streamlined footprint et cetera in the supply chain. So, we do think that medical devices will continue to be a contributor to margin. Although I must say that the business does operate at a relatively high margin already. And as a leader in the marketplace I think we should operate at that higher margin. So, that\u2019s the way I would characterize it for now, but I can\u2019t give you an outlook by sector at this time. Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company : Thanks Dominic. Louise Mehrotra :  Next question please? Operator :  The next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning David. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley :  Good morning. Dominic, I just want to -- it sounds like the operational strength of the business is going to offset any pressure from OCD, but can you just remind us on an annual basis, we had OCD potentially a $0.10 to $0.15 impact to the business, is that in kind of the rough ballpark? Dominic Caruso : Yes. On an annual basis that\u2019s a rough ballpark in terms of its contribution to earnings, $0.10 to $0.15 on an annual basis. That\u2019s right. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And this, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth. But it did sound I do think operational upside of the business can offset that number this year, not $0.10 to $0.15, but obviously the annual impact and you don\u2019t necessarily need to rely on a buyback to do so? Dominic Caruso : Well, right now we have no buyback planned. And I did say that the current guidance that we\u2019re giving, the guidance range that we\u2019re giving is sufficient to absorb any impact from the loss of profitability of the diagnostic business for the balance of the year. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay, very helpful. And Dominic, I don\u2019t want to take anyone\u2019s thunder from next month, but as relates to cardiovascular and Cordis , and it comes to mind that there has been a new management team in place there I think for 12 to 15 months and it doesn\u2019t really come up much on these calls last couple of quarters. Can you share with us sort of any strategic or operational changes that are happening in the cardiovascular franchise that perhaps we are unaware of that you find interesting? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Well, one thing I would say about our cardiovascular business is the Biosense Webster business is just fantastic. I mean it has been growing year-after-year in double-digit growth rates, launching new products, making meaningful innovations for patients et cetera. And I am sure that at the MD&D Day on May 22, you\u2019ll hear much more about that business in particular in new innovations there. Louise Mehrotra : Thanks Dominic. Two more questions and then we\u2019ll close the call. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Can you hear me okay? Good morning. Dominic Caruso : Yes. Hi Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : So thanks. I\u2019ll go back into the weeds a little bit here after going big picture for a while. So, I was wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about what the divisions were telling you in the quarter as it relates to general surgery trends. It didn\u2019t look to me like those softened at all unlike what you saw in orthopedic. So I was just wondering if there is any commentary from the divisions on general surgery that you think we might find relevant? Dominic Caruso :  The one comment that the teams told us was that with respect to elective procedures in the U.S. given the severe weather conditions, we did see some slowdown in those types of procedures. Anything else Louise that you want to\u2026 Louise Mehrotra : Yes. So when we went back and talked to our surgical care team, they did tell us there is some normal seasonality within the surgical care business. And then there was some competitive pressure in the endomechanical, but there is some seasonality actually in the surgical care business as Dominic referenced. Okay? Bob Hopkins - Bank of America :  And then one last one, just again, did the guys give you any indication on why pricing in hips got a little bit worse and just general comments on pricing within the device franchise for the quarter? Dominic Caruso :  I don\u2019t think we have any specifics on pricing within the quarter that we could talk about, but I think the numbers Louise gave earlier, just give you an indication. And it was a little bit worse in hips, but\u2026 Louise Mehrotra : Slightly higher rebate that was basically what it is, but it\u2019s not such a significant change, okay? Next question please? Bob Hopkins - Bank of America :  Okay. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra :  Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Damien Conover, Morningstar. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning Damien. Damien Conover - Morningstar:  Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a quick question on the non-biologic injectable business, just let me get a sense of both with INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, kind of what you are seeing longer term with generics entering the market? I think you mentioned INVEGA SUSTENNA; SUSTENNA not seeing any generic competition this year, but just kind of want to get a sense of when you think that generic competition might comment some of the complexities here that the generic firms have to deal with? Thanks. Louise Mehrotra :  Okay. So, the patent on INVEGA SUSTENNA in the U.S. expires April 2014 and then there are certain other patents that go out to 2017 and \u201818 related to formulations. We are not aware at this time of any applications in the U.S. for either INVEGA SUSTENNA or RISPERDAL CONSTA. RISPERDAL CONSTA is May 2014 that particular patent on it. And as far as the international, INVEGA SUSTENNA in Europe is about June 2018 and RISPERDAL CONSTA is November 2014. And again, we\u2019re not aware of any filings on it. Both of them are protected by formulation patents well beyond the composition of patent [life]. So, with that we will close the call and I\u2019ll ask Dominic to make some final remarks. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Thanks Louise and thanks everyone for joining us today. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter and I think we\u2019re very well positioned to drive growth throughout the year. We do look forward to seeing you all at the Medical Device Business Review on May 22. So, thank you again and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson first quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing second quarter results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will provide some additional commentary on the business and an update on our near term priorities. Next, Joaquin and Paul will provide an update on our pharmaceutical business, and lastly Dominic will review the income statement and provide guidance for 2014.  We will then open the call to your questions. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson Web site as is the press release. Please note we will be using presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our Web site. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site at investor.jnj.com. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide lists the acknowledgment of those relationships, not otherwise referenced in today\u2019s presentations. Now, I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $19.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014, up 9.1%. On an operational basis, sales were up 9.4% and currency had a negative impact of 0.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 14.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 5%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 0.6%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., grew by 6.5%, Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 5.3% and Europe grew 4.1%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products made strong contributions to the results in all regions. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisition, underlying organic operational growth was 10%. Turning now to earnings; net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.51 versus $1.33 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $449 million for after tax special items. Second quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $456 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.66, representing increases of 11.3% and 12.2% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represents operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the translational impact of currency. I will begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.7 billion increased 3.6% with U.S. sales down 0.5%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 5.8%. Excluding the impact of net divestitures, worldwide growth was approximately 6% with U.S. growth of approximately 5%. Major drivers of the results were over-the-counter products, skin care, baby care, as well as international sales of oral care and feminine protection products, partially offset by the divestiture of the North American Sanitary Protection business. OTC sales were strong due to analgesic growth of nearly 17% worldwide and nearly 25% in the U.S., driven by market share gains as we continue to return products to the shelves. Upper respiratory products, digestive health and antismoking products also made strong contributions to the results. Skin care results were driven by share gains for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO with new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns, category growth, as well as an increase in trade inventory levels. Baby care results were driven by strong sales across the number of categories. International oral care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.5 billion increased 21.1% with U.S. up 36.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.9% driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. A major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and EU and SOVRIAD in Japan. Excluding sales of the hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 10.5%, 15% and 6.5% respectively. Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products; STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA, as well as XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVOKANA, PREZISTA and recently launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX and CONCERTA due to generic competition and INCIVO with competitive entries. The strong results for immunology were driven by double-digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and SIMPONI. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. XARELTO sales were up over 90% compared with the same quarter last year and grew over 13% on a sequential basis. Total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anti-coagulant market grew to over 13% with cardiology TRx estimated at over 23%. The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of nearly 11.5%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 34% of that market. Continued strong market uptick and progress on reimbursement drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries. Increased market share drove results for INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and PREZISTA. INVOKANA sales contributed over 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved 2.3% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 1.8% in the first quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 7% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially. I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment sales of $7.2 billion increased 0.9%. U.S. sales declined 1.4%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. Growth was driven by orthopedics, cardiovascular care and specialty surgery, partially offset by lower sales in diabetes care, vision care and diagnostics. Lower price primarily related to competitive bidding continue to impact the diabetes care business in the U.S., while reversal of the noted customer inventory build from the first quarter and competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth for vision care. Excluding OCD and diabetes care, worldwide growth was approximately 2%. Orthopedic sales growth was driven by trauma and hips. Trauma was up 7% worldwide with sales outside the U.S. up 11% due to a successful tender offer as a result of our comprehensive portfolio offering. Hips growth of 5% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. flat and 4% growth outside the U.S. Increased sales due to the successful launch of ATTUNE were partially offset by price pressures across the region and softness in the U.S. market. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 14% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to new catheter launches and continued market expansion. Specialty surgery results were driven by energy and bio-surgery outside the U.S. with new products driving market growth and market share. There were some notable developments in the second quarter which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Alex, Joaquin and Paul will provide some additional commentary in their remarks. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson second quarter of 2014. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Well, thank you very much, Louise and thanks to all of you who are participating in today\u2019s call, welcome. It\u2019s a very dynamic time in the healthcare industry led most importantly by significant advancements in the care of patients and consumers. Treatment options have never been greater. Today hepatitis C and certain cancer treatments are more promising than ever and while diabetes and heart disease which we are unfortunately still seeing rates increased, they are much more manageable for the patient with oral medication that are increasingly convenient to take. That being said, all of us in healthcare realized that there is still so much more work to do to improve the lives of patients around the world. It is encouraging to see that healthcare reform initiatives are taking hold around the world which will enable more people to see a doctor or to have procedures they needed, it may not have had the means to do so in the past. Over the past several years, we have been discussing with you how Johnson & Johnson has been taking a consistent series of steps to ensure we are best positioned to serve the needs of patients and consumers in this dynamic and rapidly evolving environment. I would like to begin our discussion today by reviewing some of these issues. Much as we had anticipated the medical devices landscape is evolving as innovations, scale and breadth become more important to meeting the needs of the customer. At that time we noted that due to market dynamics in segments like orthopedics, the industry would likely need to consolidate, which was one factor that led to our acquisition of Synthes. In the larger device space, what the industry is now realizing is the companies like Johnson & Johnson with larger portfolios are better able to partner with hospital systems and managed care organizations to find the right balance of innovation, value and service. And as we are all observing, there are many dynamics happening in the pharmaceutical industry as well. We noted several years ago that a focused portfolio, consistent investments in R&D and overall increased productivity in our development capabilities would be the key to driving our innovation. Since making the decision to focus our portfolio on five therapeutic areas where our expertise and the opportunity to make a significant difference aligned, our pharmaceutical business has been exceptionally productive with 14 new compounds launched since 2009, making it the fastest growing of the top 10 pharmaceutical businesses in the U.S., Europe and Japan. These innovations and indeed the innovations that we\u2019re making in each of our segments enables us to meet the growing demand for health care products and services and creates new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. I want to now briefly review our perspective on where we see health care today. As I mentioned in January, the worldwide market is immense with an overall spend of over $8 trillion. At $2.4 trillion, products account for nearly 30% of the spend, growing at about 3% to 5% a year.  In medical devices, we\u2019re still seeing that utilization rates in the U.S. remain depressed both in admissions and surgical procedures but we continue to believe that as the economy recovers and healthcare reform gains momentum, utilization rates will increase. In terms of prescription rates in the first half of the year, trends have modestly continued upward versus 2013 with the U.S. Rx volume increasing through May by approximately 1% over the prior year. And global growth and GDP forecast remain above 3% on stronger momentum in advanced economies such as the U.S. and Europe, while key emerging economies including Brazil and India continue to be challenged. Given the positive demographic trends we\u2019re seeing globally in the underlying strength of our businesses, we remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of the health care market and with our comprehensive and diverse portfolio of consumer health products, medical devices and pharmaceutical, Johnson & Johnson has a distinct competitive advantage in meeting the needs of patients. We re-implemented the strategic framework, a very disciplined and focused approach to evolving our position as the world\u2019s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Grounded by our credo, we identified four growth drivers which by now all of you should be very familiar with, creating value through innovation, global reach, local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. We are executing against these growth drivers and capitalizing on our scale and breadth across Johnson & Johnson to ensure that we\u2019re effectively positioned to drive and sustain strong global growth over the long-term. Now in the near-term, we also have clear priorities for the businesses including achieving our financial targets. As announced earlier today, we had record sales in the quarter of $19.5 billion which is a 9.4% operational increase as compared to the second quarter of 2013. These strong results reflect a continued success of our new product launches and progress we made in achieving our near-term priorities. In our Medical Device and Diagnostic segment, we are leading the industry with the largest most comprehensive business in the world. And while combining businesses with overlapping products and different business models can be disruptive, our integration over the past two years of DePuy and Synthes which we mentioned earlier has gone well. Given that we\u2019re largely through it, we set a strong foundation for capturing the full growth potential we envisioned at the onset and we\u2019re pleased with the revenue and cost synergy we\u2019ve begun to realize. And despite the market pressures, we remain optimistic about the future in this segment and are seeing strong performance in many of our MD&D businesses. In hips, we experienced strong operational growth at 5% in the quarter and continue to complement this growth with new product introductions such as the recently launched CORAIL Revision Hip System in both the United States and Europe. We also continue to see solid growth in trauma at 7% for the quarter which is built on the strength of our portfolio and the positive impact of a tender we were awarded in the Middle East as a result of our comprehensive offerings.  In our global surgery business, we continue to see progress in many areas including consistent double-digit growth of our BioSense Webster electrophysiology portfolio. We also have a steady cadence of new product offerings exemplified by the recent FDA approval of our supplemental PMA with the SEDASYS System which we anticipate introducing into the U.S. market in the latter half of 2014 as well as the launch of the HARMONIC ACE +7 Shears with advanced hemostasis, the first purely ultrasonic device with a 7 millimeter sealing indication; it\u2019s really a great technology.  And as you heard at our MD&D Investor Meeting in May, our strategy for sustainable long-term growth is driven by building on the strong market leadership positions we hold on the majority of our key platforms, as well as the contributions we anticipate from our recently launched products and future pipeline which includes more than 30 major filings planned by the end of 2016, many on which we have already made good progress since our presentations in May. Finally, in-line with our emphasis to tighten the focus within our MD&D portfolio, we\u2019re creating value through divestiture opportunities and completed the divestiture of our ortho clinical diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group which Dominic will discuss in his remarks. OCD plays a very important role in health care and we\u2019re confident that it is well positioned to continue serve in the interest of patients, customers and employees. Turning now to our consumer business, where growth is closely tied with GDP trends, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of the business and executing the strategy we outlined last summer. We have successfully exited a few business categories recently, enabling us to focus on delivering above market growth in our core business. And we anticipate greater opportunities to expand the business in the future as global economies recover and the middle-class continue to grow.  Our consumer brands are important for the equity of Johnson & Johnson and consumer health care truly is strategic for us with the potential to serve the 2 billion additional consumers who are predicted to join the growing middle-class in emerging markets. We made significant progress in this segment over the last few years and have plans for the coming years to accelerate the growth of this business through new innovations, brand building and strategic collaborations, working off with foundation that starts with deep consumer insights.  As part of our strategy, we have defined 11 key need states where with our expertise we can make a difference to consumers and grow our business. We are also focusing on 12 mega brands including LISTERINE, AVEENO, TYLENOL and JOHNSON\u2019s Baby to ensure they are exceeding consumers\u2019 expectations around the world and the strategy is working. We are capturing share in these and several of the other key categories. For example, we have seen strong growth in our oral care business outside the U.S. at 7% operationally. Our skin care and baby businesses are both up 7% operationally in the quarter. And we are also developing innovative collaboration models with retailers across the globe where we are working to create an unparalleled experience for shoppers in OTC categories like cold and flu, by sharing insights and developing ways to reduce complexity for consumers and drive visibility for our offerings. In our U.S., OTC business, we continue making good progress in restoring brands to the shelves, delivering above market growth and continue to meet each of our obligations under the consent decree.  While we still have work to do, our goal is to ensure all of our U.S., OTC products are available every time a consumer is reaching for them. And I\u2019m confident that we are on a good path to meet that goal. Turning now to our pharmaceutical business and as results show the current business is very strong, driven by new innovative products that are clearly addressing the unmet medical needs of patients worldwide and the future is bright with the continued advancement in our pipeline. By any measure, our performance has been outstanding in this segment and we are leading the industry on numerous fronts.  Clinical through commercial and later this morning you\u2019ll hear more from Paul and Joaquin, who I am pleased to have joining us on the call later today.  You\u2019ll recall that in the late 2000s, our pharmaceutical business faced significant patent expirations as products worth roughly $8 billion went off patent. We have to rethink that business model and really focused on areas where we could make a difference. We needed to streamline our organization and made tough choices to gain efficiencies and reduce headcount in developed markets by nearly 25%. But through our diversified business model, with consumer and MD&D continuing to grow during this time, we were able to continue to invest in our pharma business.  We are also continuing to invest in R&D in our five therapeutic areas at approximately 20% to 21% of sales and we have put those dollars to work with plan to file more than 10 new drugs and 25 line extensions between 2013 and 2017. Additionally, we are complementing that investment with smaller scale acquisitions and early stage licensing agreements surfaced through our innovation centers. For Johnson & Johnson, this model has been an excellent source of value creation. And I am delighted that Paul Stoffels, Joaquin Duato are joining the call today to provide an update on their tremendous work. A little over a year ago, we created the Johnson & Johnson Research and Development Management Committee led by Paul. This group brings together the senior most R&D leaders across Johnson & Johnson to foster cross-sector collaboration and deliver transformational new medicines and medical devices. Under Paul\u2019s excellent leadership our enterprise R&D leaders are harnessing our deep internal expertise and platform capabilities throughout the organization to develop customer focused solutions that combine our capabilities and expertise across our portfolios.  And the commercial pharmaceutical strategies led by Joaquin, are delivering outstanding results in very competitive global markets where we\u2019re continuing to gain share and we\u2019re also securing reimbursement and access at accelerated rates. The teams they have put in place have positioned us for continued success for many years to come in our pharmaceutical sector. I am please now to turn the call over to Paul and Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Alex, and good morning everyone. Paul and I are delighted to speak to you today about our continued success at our pharmaceutical group. When we look at the pharmaceuticals market, we\u2019re very optimistic about the future with an estimated 4.5% growth anticipated through 2017. While we recognized we\u2019ll continue to experience headwinds, we also see numerous positive drivers, including changing demographics and substantial unmet medical needs. As a result, there is significant opportunity to improve the lives of patients by bringing transformational medical innovations to the market. As Louise mentioned, we\u2019re reporting 21.1% operational growth in the second quarter of 2014. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth including the six consecutive quarters in double-digits. Without our hepatitis C products, our growth in the last quarter was 10.5%. I am often asked, Joaquin, is this just a lucky run or is there something more to it. After facing significant challenges in the early 2000, we made a number of strategic changes to our business including building key development manufacturing market access and commercial competencies and focusing our innovation to produce a consistent stream of differentiated new products. These changes are directly responsible for the success we\u2019re seeing now and we believe position us to continue to succeed in the future.  Specifically with our focus on the five strategic priorities that you see on this slide, I will speak to you about the first two of these priorities and then hand off to Paul to cover the remaining three. When we look at our commercial performance, the first thing to note is that our success is global. We are the fastest growing top 10 global pharmaceutical company in the U.S., Europe, and Japan by a significant margin. Key to the success has been both the sales of our core growth products and the sales of new products. Regarding our core growth products, you can see that REMICADE, VELCADE, and PREZISTA all continue to deliver strong growth. 2013 REMICADE sales were 6.7 billion, which were 9% higher than 2012. In the second quarter of this year, sales grew at 8.7%. This is a product that has been in the market since 1998. VELCADE remains a backbone of multiple myeloma treatment, delivering 6.2% growth in the second quarter.  Finally PREZISTA is the number one HIV protease inhibitor in the U.S. and Europe and we\u2019re pleased to note the recent approval in Canada of PREZCOBIX, our fixed dose combination with Gilead\u2019s cobicistat with a file for approval also in the U.S. and in Europe. We have achieved remarkable success with our new products. As you can see on the left, worldwide sales of new products launched since 2009 have already generated $5.9 billion of revenue this year and represent nearly 40% of our second quarter sales.  In the United States alone, our cumulative sales of new products launched since 2009 is more than our next two closest competitors combined. I would now like to spend a few minutes speaking about the specific products that have driven this performance. ZYTIGA is the most successful oral oncology launch in history. It is now approved for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer in more than 90 countries. And the metastatic castration sensitive registration trial is on track. As you can see ZYTIGA continues to hold significant market share in U.S., gaining 1.2 points versus the first quarter this year.  Worldwide, we generated second quarter sales of $562 million, representing more than 40% growth year-over-year. Nearly 60% of the sales in the quarter were outside the U.S. As for B-cell malignancies in the last year we launched our oral oncology drug IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration with Pharmacyclics with a worldwide license agreement for a 50-50 profit split. IMBRUVICA is launched in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy.  Both indications are based on an overall response rate and improvement in survival or disease related symptoms has not yet been established. Moving forward, we\u2019re pursuing a global regulatory strategy for IMBRUVICA in all major markets with European MCL and CLL decisions expected later this year. IMBRUVICA has been investigated in a number of global chemical trials across potential indications. In immunology, we are proud to note Janssen was the number one company in total U.S. sales in 2013. This was of course driven by REMICADE, which I mentioned earlier and by STELARA and SIMPONI. STELARA is the fastest growing biologic in psoriasis in major markets, including number one new-to-brand share in the U.S. This is in large part due to STELARA, key psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis approvals and because we are able to demonstrate the five year safety and efficacy of STELARA through real-world trials and registry data. For SIMPONI its ulcerative colitis indication is approved in 43 countries and I\u2019m pleased to note that the IV formulation for rheumatoid arthritis has launched in the U.S. and in Canada. Both of these products have seen robust growth this quarter more than 40% and 60% respectively. Turning to XARELTO, we have established a highly competitive position in the U.S. with six FDA approved indications and more than 1.6 million patients treated. XARELTO is a number one novel, oral anticoagulant among U.S cardiologists. This is impart due to the fact that XARELTO has broad market access with more than 90% coverage of insured patients and the lowest co-pay of any branded novel anti-coagulant. And also because XARELTO offers a strong customer value proposition with once a day dosing convenience. As a result, we are reporting strong sales of $361 million in the second quarter, up more than 90% year-over-year. In the last quarter alone, we saw a sequential growth greater than 13%. Another example of our innovation is INVOKANA, our SGLT2 inhibitor we launched recently in collaboration with our Diabetes Care franchise. INVOKANA is a once daily medication offering improved glycemic control, reduction in body weight and reduction in systolic blood pressure. These are all extremely important factors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. INVOKANA is approved in 45 countries and our fixed dose combination with metformin, VOKANAMET is approved in Europe. We expect the FDA decision for this fixed dose combination in the third quarter. This year alone we have had seven major launches of INVOKANA and have received key reimbursement approvals in the U.K., Switzerland and the Netherlands. As you can see, we are number one in new-to-brand share among U.S. endocrinologist in a very competitive landscape. As Louise mentioned, INVOKANA contributed more than 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. In schizophrenia, we continue to provide medicines and solutions to improve patient care. In the U.S. we are pleased to note that the FDA granted priority review of INVEGA SUSTENNA One Month for schizoaffective disorder with a PDUFA date in November. We also recently leveraged a first of its kind real-world clinical trial with INVEGA SUSTENNA to support the filing of a sNDA. It includes data for the label demonstrating significant delayed time to relapse in schizophrenia compared to oral antipsychotics. The chart on the right shows the strong launch performance of INVEGA SUSTENNA outperforming Abilify Maintena which in the second quarter resulted in sales of $394 million, representing a 34.4% growth year-over-year. The last example I will discuss is our recently launched hepatitis C treatment with brand names OLYSIO, GALEXOS and SOVRIAD. We continue to see significant market potential in the hepatitis C area and estimate nearly 97% of the infected population in G7 countries remains untreated. As you are aware interferon free treatment options represent a significant advance for patients. OLYSIO is approved for the use in interferon free treatment in combination with other medicinal products in Europe in genotype 1 or 4 patients who are interferon ineligible or intolerant. In the U.S. the FDA granted priority review of our sNDA based on the COSMOS trial data for the use of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, currently marketed at Sovaldi by Gilead with a PDUFA date of November the 6. In-line with the AASLD and IDSA guidelines, we have seen very strong adoption in the first half of this year with second quarter sales totaling $831 million. Moving forward we recognize there will be increased competitive activity with the entrance of new interferon treatment options beginning later this year and thus we expect the current run rate is unlikely to continue into 2015. We are planning studies to evaluate simeprevir with other agents to offer physicians and patients increased flexibility. Turning now to emerging markets, our strategy is focused on a strong innovative brand growth through targeted capability building and novel access models. In particular, we are harnessing innovation. One example of this is the opening of our Shanghai Innovation Center expected in October this year. We\u2019re also improving local manufacturing capacity by building factories such as our state-of-the-art facility in Xi'an, China and through technology transfer to local organizations.  Finally, we\u2019re pioneering new business models through public-private partnerships, leveraging the strength of our Johnson & Johnson organization to improve access to our medicines. As you can see, we have had remarkable global success. This success is the direct result of a strategic choices and changes that we made to our business years ago. Going forward, we\u2019re focused on two critical success factors to maintain our momentum. First, we will continue to leverage our world class capabilities in clinical development, regulatory manufacturing, market access and commercial, to promote the ongoing success of our new products.  In total, six of these products have each sold more than $ 1 billion in the last four quarters and two more are on track to reach this threshold. As you saw on the previous slide, several have robust growth rates of 40%, 60% and even 90%. Second, we are deeply committed to sustaining long-term growth and Paul will now tell you more about how our total emphasis on innovation has built a strong pipeline of transformational products that we believe will catalyze the next wave of growth for our business. Paul? Paul Stoffels : Thank you Joaquin and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure today to discuss with you our pharmaceutical R&D strategy which is focused on delivering transformational medical innovation and create the cycle of success that positions us for continued growth in the future. Our vision to enter R&D strategy has not changed. As a leading healthcare company, we believe that by focusing on transformational innovation, medical need and differentiation, we can make a significant difference in the world and build a sustainable growing business.  We have some of the world\u2019s leading scientific and medical experts who bring deep insights to select and prioritize the best science, internal or external, to tackle those diseases. We have established unparalleled global development capabilities and have set industry benchmark for timelines for filing submissions and productivity and also for speed to market. We launched 14 new products in the past five years in major markets around the world, including three new molecular entities or NMEs that we launched since our pharmaceutical\u2019s update in May last year; OLYSIO, IMBRUVICA and SYLVANT, that strategy is delivering.  In the last update at a Pharmaceutical Analyst Day last May, we told you that we anticipated to filing more than 10 potential NMEs and more than 25 significant line extensions between 2013 and 2017. We are on track to deliver. Since last May, in addition to launching three new products, we have received 20 additional approvals for line extensions in major markets. The significant line extensions approved are SIMPONI for ulcerative colitis, SIMPONI ARIA for rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S., IMBRUVICA for previously treated CLL, VELCADE for multiple myeloma retreatment combination therapy and transplant, OLYSIO for treatment of experienced patients, STELARA for psoriatic arthritis and VOKANAME fixed dose combination with metformin immediately release formulation for type 2 diabetes in Europe.  Our winning formula has been consistent. First, we believe in focus. We focused on the few key disease areas where we can really make a difference and we prioritize our investments in those areas. The disease area focus has allowed us to attract the world\u2019s leading scientists and medical experts and build a great depth of expertise in those areas. Second, our experts select and source the best science and technology through our own internal research or by accessing the best science externally through partnerships, collaborations, licensing and acquisitions.  Third, we leverage the present scale of our global development organization. Our global capabilities have allowed us to simultaneously develop, file and launch drugs across the globe with industry-leading efficiency, quality and success rates. And finally, one of our key success factors has been our ability to accelerate cycle times and achieve industry-leading timelines for regulatory submissions. I will focus on each of these success factors next. Our focus on innovation is a critical aspect of the strategy. We focus our research in five therapeutic areas and within those areas we focus on specific disease areas where there is a high unmet need, where there is transformational science that we can leverage and where we have deep expertise and capabilities that we can bring to bear. Today, we\u2019re focused on 18 disease areas and in each of these areas we have leading expertise and know-how to select the best science thereby increasing the probability of success. We have also entered into the exciting area of immuno-oncology where there is promising new signs and has established several collaborations.  This slide shows our entire end-to-end strategy on one page. Build a rigorous approach to sourcing innovation, to global development, and the key characteristics of a strategy that sets us apart. In addition to the deep internal expertise within our therapeutic areas, we have strong research capabilities in biomarkers and world-class capabilities in our centers of excellence in small molecules, bio-technology, vaccines and diagnostics. We complement this with external innovation. We access early innovation to our J&J innovation centers in London, Boston, San Francisco and Shanghai. Today we have over 100 projects in discovery and about 50 NMEs in early development. In addition, we have more than 300 collaborations externally and over 50 companies located in our incubator. To access innovation in the early development stage, we leverage venture capital to invest in exciting growth opportunities, explore new areas and accelerate assets. In late-stage, we access innovation via traditional licensing, partnerships and acquisition example of which include our recent deals with Genmab on multiple myeloma, with Aragon on prostate cancer, with ViiV Healthcare on HIV and with Vertex on influenza A. As I mentioned, we have world-class global development capabilities. We have built strong medical and scientific teams with disease area, clinical and regulatory expertise. We are increasing the value of our R&D portfolio by optimizing outputs, time, cost and quality. Our 24x7 development operations, speed-to-market and global execution make us a partner of choice in the industry. These capabilities along with our market access and launch excellence, represent some of our key strengths and differentiators. They have enabled us to simultaneously file and launch our products globally, generate compelling value evidence and deliver successful launches of our products in multiple markets. And the flexibility and commercialization models with partners and our ability to collaborate and leverage our strength and capabilities, enable us to achieve industry-leading success and growth. A deep understanding of the innovation landscape is key to our ability to source innovation.  Our experts define an innovation strategy, conduct a holistic scan of the innovation landscape and prioritize all accessible opportunities, internal or external to select the best assets. Here you see a bulls eye chart of the innovation landscape for B-cell malignancy. The inner circles represent later stage products and the outer circles the early stage preclinical products. We take this rigorous approach to evaluating and sourcing innovation in each of the disease areas. Our development organization continues to deliver. We have a flexible R&D operations engine which can pivot from execution of mega trials to execution of trials for rare diseases and today is supporting about 75,000 patients across 400 clinical studies annually. These capabilities have accelerated our speeds to market. They have enabled a successful execution of notable comprehensive and large clinical programs which are outcomes-based and use adaptive study designs. We have round the world, round the clock capabilities in all aspects of the clinical development and a critical path culture that enables the speed while maintaining quality. Our fourth critical success factor has been our ability to accelerate cycle time. Because of our focus on medical need and differentiation, of the last 10 new NMEs we launched, five received priority review status. In addition, we received breakthrough designation for five indications with three of our products. Today, average cycle time from database to submission is about two months better than industry median making us the leader in time to submission. These capabilities have enabled us to have industry-leading NME success rate with fastest cycle times. Compared to our competitors, we have a higher development success rate resulting in more NME approvals per year. Looking to the future, we have an exciting pipeline. On the left you see the three NME approvals since May 2013 and the number of significant line extensions approved since last May. In the middle you can see some of our key NMEs which are under clinical investigation as potential treatment for key unmet needs in a variety of areas. Daratumumab, the first anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, a compound with breakthrough status which we licensed from Genmab; ARN-509, an androgen receptor inhibitor for pre-metastatic prostate cancer which came to us from the acquisition of Aragon; FGFR kinase inhibitors for solid tumors discovered in a collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals; Sirukumab, the first anti-IL-6 therapy for patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases; Guselkumab, the first anti-IL-23 antibody for psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune diseases; Fulranumab, an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain licensed from Amgen; and Esketamine, the first NMDA antagonist for patients with treatment-resistant depression also with breakthrough designation. And VX-787, a first-in-class influenza A specific oral polymerase inhibitor, a compound we recently licensed from Vertex. We also have a number of key line extensions in development including for key products such as XARELTO and INVOKANA. We have Paliperidone Palmitate three-month formulation, the first three-month long-acting injectable treatment for patients with schizophrenia. And ibrutinib the first BTK inhibitor oncology drug for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies.  Our people are driven by a sense of purpose to care for the world. At times we develop a product just because it is a right thing to do. We have the privilege to serve in health care and we also have a responsibility. One example of this is SIRTURO the first therapy with novel mechanism of action against TB approved by the FDA in more than 40 years. SIRTURO is now approved in U.S., Europe, Russia and Korea and the file is under review in seven other countries. We have established multiple product development partnerships and through our agreement with the Global Drug Facility, we are making SIRTURO available to critically ill patients in 130 countries. We also established a collaboration with the International Partnership for Microbicides for the development of TMC120 for prevention of transmission of HIV, which is now in large scale clinical testing. We are providing access to products by not enforcing patents on PREZISTA in Sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries and by licensing of HIV products to generic producers. And finally to a vaccine unit, we also make critical vaccines available to children around the world and we\u2019re developing new vaccines for polio and HIV. In summary, we are in an extraordinary cycle of success. We have world-class commercial capabilities driving our growth. Our accelerated emerging market performance is sustaining a momentum. Our focus on innovation, medical need and differentiation sets us up to deliver future growth. We have a leading R&D pipeline with differentiated therapies addressing major unmet needs in significant markets. Our innovation is delivering growth and our growth is sustaining our ability to invest in innovation. We believe our business is well positioned to succeed for the long-term. Thank you and now, let me turn it back to Alex. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Paul and Joaquin. I hope you can see why we\u2019re also proud of the Pharmaceutical segment and very optimistic about our future growth in this area. So, I would now like to turn it over to Dominic Caruso for more detailed review of our financial performance. Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Alex, and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve heard on the call, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress and strong results thus far in 2014 and we\u2019re well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic health care environment. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter as well as the recently completed OCD divestiture. I will then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2014. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. We are pleased to report adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter which was up 11.3% over the second quarter of 2013. And adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.48 a year ago, up 12.2%, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. These results were driven by strong operational sales growth of 9%, primarily from our recently launched pharmaceutical products including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO or SOVRIAD which is the brand name in Japan. The net impact of our hepatitis C products including OLYSIO, SOVRIAD and INCIVO contributed approximately 4% to the worldwide operational sales growth. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude certain charges for the following special items. Cost associated with the continued integration of Synthes and additional reserves for litigation expenses. Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I am pleased to point out that we saw a very good operating performance this quarter. Overall, our pretax operating margin increased 230 basis points and a major driver of that increase came from sales of OLYSIO. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points higher than a same period last year, primarily due to pricing dynamics and the impact of the devaluation of the Japanese yen partly offset by positive mix of the business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 200 basis points lower as compared with the second quarter of 2013, due to the growth of new products in our pharmaceutical business and overall good management of cost primarily in our MD&D business. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared with the prior year, primarily due to timing of various R&D programs, as we expect to continue to make important investments for the future. Interest expense net of interest income of approximately $100 million was slightly higher than prior year. Other expenses net of other income was $226 million in the quarter compared to $172 million in the same period of last year. Now excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other expenses net of other income was actually a net gain of $194 million compared to a net gain of $394 million as prior year reflected the gain we recognized on the sale of our shares in Elan Corporation. This year, the net gain reflects the divestiture of our K-Y brand partly offset by some asset write-downs. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.1% compared to 20% in the same period last year, due primarily to geographic mix of the results in each period. Early in the third quarter, we completed the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics to the Carlyle Group for approximately $4 billion subject to customary adjustments. On an after-tax basis and we will record a net gain of approximately $1 billion which we will treat as a special item in the third quarter results. Since we will no longer recognize sales or earnings from this business going forward, we plan to buy back shares with the cash proceeds to mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Before we discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast; beginning with cash and interest income and expense.  At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $14.5 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $31.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $17.1 billion of debt. For purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million which is consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $450 million to $550 million, which is lower than our previous guidance. And now a word on taxes; our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by congress, although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year. Now turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in April. For sales, our assumptions remains consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition in 2014 and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year. Further, our guidance now reflects the divestitures of OCD and the net incremental sales of our hepatitis C products. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis between 4.5% and 5.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014, again on a constant currency basis, for approximately $74.5 billion to $75.3 billion which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the net impact of the adjustment for the divestiture of OCD and incremental hepatitis C product sales. Our underlying operational growth in 2014 guidance excluding the hepatitis C products and OCD for the full year is approximately 4%. As you know we are anticipating that OLYSIO will face significant competition from new hepatitis C products later in the year, the full impact of which is difficult for us to predict at this point. And while we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2015, this will certainly pose a headwind next year.  We\u2019re also not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 0.5%; plus under this scenario we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4% and 5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $74.1 billion to $74.9 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance, again now adjusted for OCD and hepatitis C products as noted earlier. Moving on to earnings; there are factors to note about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation. As we have discussed in the past, the devaluation of the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. Dollar is expected to have a negative impact on 2014 gross margins of approximately 60 basis points or negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.11. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact of an official devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar or any other currency.  Our 2014 guidance reflects the strong performance we saw in the second quarter. The second half impact of the divestiture of OCD, a lower level of net gains at other income and expenses and our plan to continue investing in future growth. Given those factors, we suggest that you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.80 and $5.87 per share on an operational or constant currency basis.   Again while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS of currency exchange rates would have remained where they were as of last week for the balance of the year then our reported EPS excluding special items would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS excluding special items in the range between $5.85 and $5.92 per share or a growth rate of 6% to 7%; this is higher than our previous guidance. And as a reminder, our earnings include intangible amortization of $1.4 billion on a before tax basis or an impact of approximately $0.38 on EPS. As you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a stronger improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels than we previously expected. This is due to the strong performance of our business primarily driven by new product launches including the significant benefit from OLYSIO this year. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results through the midpoint. Our strong performance in the second quarter has allowed us to offset the negative earnings impact that will occur in the second half of this year from the recently completed divestiture of the OCD business. Although we expect to see lower other income and expense gains and along with our intent to invest in future growth, we are very comfortable with an overall increase in our earnings guidance. And now I\u2019d like to turn things back over to Louise for that Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. Jennifer, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Good morning. Quickly for Alex and then also for Joaquin or Paul. Alex I\u2019m going straight from M&A for you, but for big picture I just might kind of your view on GDP growth in developed markets. It sounds like in Medtech we\u2019re seeing a bit of a disconnect maybe in consumer as well, it is a growing to your GDP, we\u2019ll be improving. What's your view in the near-term and long-term that the correlation may improve or get better as you look at your forecast? Alex Gorsky : Yes. Matt, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for the question. As you know trying to predict these things out of the future is always a bit of a challenge. But as we\u2019re experiencing right now and as we discussed earlier in the discussion, we\u2019re seeing hospital utilization rates specifically admission, surgical procedures, lab procedures and even primary care physician visits, they remained somewhat subdued. And we\u2019ve seen this trend for several quarters now. Long-term of course we see the offset to that in demographics, increasing middle class increasing access to care under the Affordable Care Act as drivers for us. So we remained optimistic because we don\u2019t think that there is a fundamental reason for the underlying demand or disease rights to change, but that's not something that we\u2019re certainly watching. If we look across to Europe, we continue to see some challenge in areas. But overall, we would say that the impact in Europe has moderated somewhat and we continue to see good solid growth in the developing markets. I mean overall we had about 10% growth on an annual basis so far in BRIC and we expect that to continue into the future as well. So, I mean I think that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. But it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re going to continue to watch closely. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Thanks Alex. And a quick one for Paul or Joaquin, you gave us a lot of data on the pharma, the pipeline in the near-term, can you just say broadly on the R&D because you\u2019re still spending a lot of money as a percent of sales even though the overall pharma growth has accelerated. Can you say of the five therapeutic areas is oncology and immunology getting the lion\u2019s share of that in the current run rate? Paul Stoffels : Yes absolutely. Especially oncology is getting the lion share of that, we have several new director oncology therapeutics; Daratumumab, ARN-509, ibrutinib with all of the line extensions, as well as now immuno-oncology where we have several collaborations and a lot of internal research ongoing, as well as efforts in biomarkers in establishing diagnostic biomarkers approach to get to a much better patient outcome. So that is definitely the largest. As well as immunology where we still continue to focus on several new products; Guselkumab and we have also there a number of new oral therapies in development. So, those two continue to be the focus of the organization with significant resources. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Thanks Paul. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with JP Morgan. Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan : Dominic, I just want to start with the quarter and with the guidance revision I think one of the questions people have is why didn\u2019t J&J raise guidance by more than they do at this point. So I wonder maybe we could spend a minute on that, but the quarter itself was $0.11 above this rate consensus you raised by $0.05 in the low-end, $0.02 in the high-end and you\u2019re observing $0.05 of dilution from OCD, it looks like each of them, the other income gain assumed for the year by the $0.04, anything else that I am missing there and maybe just want to comment on the decision to raise guidance which you did? Dominic Caruso : Yes, sure Mike, thanks. Just a couple of points, I mean we did of course exceed street estimates for the quarter by $0.11. As you know, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, we provide annual guidance, and when we spoke to the investment community last quarter we were confident that our strong operating results would help absorb the OCD dilution in the back half of the year within the range we have previously provided. So let me just walk down the items that you\u2019ve mentioned. We did exceed analyst estimates by about $0.11. Almost half of that will be used of course to offset the OCD lower earnings in the back half of the year. As you pointed out, other income and expense gains will be lower than we expected this year. That\u2019s another $0.03 or $ 0.04. Currency was a minor adjustment. If you look at our overall guidance, we therefore after absorbing this $0.11 that we just described, we do think that overall guidance is up about four pennies. If we think about the midpoint of our guidance, last time it was about 585 the mid-point now it is about 589. So we feel good that despite this reconciliation that you just walked through, the business will continue to perform well and therefore we are comfortable raising the guidance for the balance of the year. Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan : Okay, and let me ask one product question if I can and the reason, during the quarter there was a new patent issue for ZYTIGA, that I was hoping you could just comment on your current expectations where generic competition for ZYTIGA industry historically assume that would come in late 2016. Can you update us or your thoughts on that topic? Joaquin Duato : Thank you. This is Joaquin. You are correct. Our expectation is that ZYTIGA patent will go until December 16, that is the composition of matter with a five-year data exclusivity under Hatch-Waxman extension. Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan : : And Joaquin the notice of allowance on the three-four patent; does that seem like taking it all in terms of timing? Joaquin Duato : Not at this point. We are now working and understanding what the impact of this notice of allowance is. As a matter of patent use, so at this point we remain -- we have our position that I described before. Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan : Thanks Joaquin. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Just first, just starting the quarter, Dominic, I was wondering if you could call out, or help us think through a little bit about the margin contribution of OLYSIO and impact of the Japanese Yen, so we can get a better sense for kind of what the underlying operating margin of the business might being moving forward excluding kind of those items. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Derrick. Well, overall, including the negative impact of the Japanese Yen to gross margins which was said was about 60 basis points for the year. Obviously, we saw most of that in the second quarter. The overall pre-tax operating margin improved about 230 basis points despite that headwind. And I would say about two thirds of that improvement is attributable to OLYSIO. That\u2019s how we frame it. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and that\u2019s something that -- when we think about sort of next year moving forward, how much of that should we think about perhaps not being sustainable? Dominic Caruso : Well, I would say, it\u2019s a little -- as I mentioned earlier, Derrick, it\u2019s a little too early to predict. I mean, we know that new competition is coming, but at this point it\u2019s premature to speculate on it. Obviously, when we speak to you in January about our guidance for \u201915, we\u2019ll make that much clear then. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thanks. And then a specific pharma product question. I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of biosimilar competition to REMICADE. So next year in the European markets, the major European market, should start seeing some biosimilar competition. What are your expectations there? Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you were seeing in these few markets where you are already seeing that biosimilar entrant? And then in the U.S., one of the competitors has talked about filing for a biosimilar REMICADE before the end of this year with potential FDA approval for next year. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how secure you feel about your IP position in the U.S. for REMICADE? Joaquin Duato : Thanks for the question. And the biosimilars area is something that we watch very closely. As you know, biosimilars are not identical to their innate or medicines and therefore the contingency in which they will prescribe will be different than the situation we have in a small molecule. At the same time, developing and manufacturing and commercializing biosimilars has different costs. I mean they need to prepare a full clinical dossier and manufacturing biologics is an expensive and complex process. And commercializing them will have also additional cost. So we expect biosimilars to behave as lower cost brands. And from that perspective, biosimilars wouldn\u2019t have the type of impacting erosion that you see with generic and small molecules. A good example of that is what happened with Epoetin Alfa in Europe. We lost the patent years ago and we remained a leading Epoetin Alfa product in Europe despite of the biosimilar that had been launched, now what is our part in landscape today, you refer to the U.S. in our two key markets in the U.S., our patent would expire in September 18 and in our key European as present 80% of European sales in February 15. Our strategy regarding biosimilar remained the same. We are going to clearly work with the regulatory authorities to ensure patient safety in this area as far as the conditions in which these products have to be developed and have to be prescribed that include naming, which we think it\u2019s important, that includes to what extent indications should not be extrapolated and that includes also obviously interchangeability, so that\u2019s the first point that we\u2019re working globally in order to ensure patient safety. The second point is that we have an extensive safety real-world evidence database with regards to REMICADE, it\u2019s been used already prescribing 2 million patients, it was launched in 1998 and we believe that is a factor that this is we consider when they prescribe. And the third one is that we continue to invest in immunology as Paul described, we think there is a still unmet medical needs there and we\u2019re going to work in different mechanic or fractions such anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-23 in order to try to address these unmet medical needs. So that\u2019s our strategy and now impact so far of biosimilars in the countries that have been launched like Korea or some European countries in which we are not patent protected. The impact has been very-very limited and the price erosion has also been limited. The discount in which these products have been launched averaged about 25% to the branded price, so that\u2019s the situation today as far as the biosimilar to REMICADE. With regard to your question of the U.S. and the patent of REMICADE in the U.S., we feel very strong about the strength of patents and we continue confirm that our patent as we see today will expire in September 18. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Two for Alex, so Alex, this is one of the best quarters you posted in many-many years I think. I doubt 10% organic growth and 12% EPS growth is the sustainable long term, so what are your financial goals for J&J long term? And how should investors think about kind of what\u2019s realistic for J&J over the next few years? And I did have one follow-up for you Alex. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Larry. Thanks a lot for the question. As we articulated back in January, we see that longer term the overall healthcare market growing somewhere in the rate of 3% to 5% and we definitely try to manage for the long-term, and so while quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year we may see some fluctuations. We think generally speaking as we put in all the ups and downs going forward that\u2019s probably a pretty reasonable estimate in consistent with what a lot of surveys would show. Our goal is that we want to always exceed the market growth i.e., we want to be bringing new innovations to market, we want to be competitive in the way we gain share. So we always aspire and shoot to exceed what the market growth is, and we said in terms of our overall profitability and bottom line performance that a company of our size and our of our scale should consistently strive to grow our bottom line at or slightly faster than our top. So that\u2019s really our long term strategy, but as you\u2019ve acknowledged at the beginning of the question, we\u2019re very proud the performance that we\u2019re posting as of now. And certainly it\u2019s led by our pharmaceutical group that really by any measure has done exceedingly well starting by bringing a lot of great new therapies that were helping patients, but also driving our business. But I also think if you look across the balance of business, our consumer as we noted while up 3.5 operationally, if we netted out for divestitures growing at almost 6%, and if you look at the strength of some of underlying brands skin care, baby care, North America OTCs, all very solid high single digits taking share across the boards that we\u2019re pleased with that. And even in our MD&D while clearly we a few areas that had been challenged such as the pricing in the diabetes market, the OCD divestiture, and some investments we\u2019re making in other areas we think if we net out for divestitures in some of those extremes, we\u2019re probably up at about 2% with clearly a path to growth faster going forward. So that\u2019s the way we see it over all Larry. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : That\u2019s very helpful and into good segway into my follow-up, so you\u2019ve talked about consolidation, the need for consolidation in the med-tech industry earlier in your remarks, so can you talk about the implications of the Medtronic-Covidien merger for the industry J&J and how do you use the J&J MD&D business evolving over the next few years? Thanks. Alex Gorsky : Sure, and thank you. Larry, as you think back to about three years ago when we announced the Synthes acquisition I think 2.5 to 3 years, part of the strategy rationale that we made at that time was that we, we definitely saw consolidation in the future simply because of the number of different participants you had in the market. The pressures that we expected going forward and as a result of that we believe proactively sought out and conducted the Synthes acquisition, which we\u2019re pleased with the way that it\u2019s going, and we have achieved our sales as well as our margin, goals that we have set for ourselves along the way and in fact I think, after the last couple of years of going through disruption which you would anticipate in a merger of that size, I think now we\u2019re really poised for solid growth going forward.  And so, what I would say is at that time we had predicted to that in fact it would happen, I think the other aspect, of course, we looked at areas like our cardiovascular business and drug alluding stands. And we saw a lot of market pressure ahead both in terms of volume and pricing. We therefore made a difficult decision to access that market, but nonetheless we think that that was the right decision to make base upon the overall dynamics.  So, if we look at ourselves today, we think we\u2019re clearly the broadest medical device company. We think we\u2019re well positioned, particularly when you consider areas like general surgery, like orthopedics we have not only brought, but also deep offerings that gives us solid market positions across the number of different platforms. We realized that in cardiovascular we\u2019re subscale, we have a very strong EP business that\u2019s growing at 14% we also estimate innovations but by continuing frankly to monitor and watch that market as we see what happens in some of those segments. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad place to be. And certainly we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from line Matt Miksic, Piper Jaffray. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Good morning. One for you Alex, just on your conversation around emerging markets; I appreciate all the additional color and the update. I was curious given the traditional strategies for penetrating this market and I\u2019d say over the last several years are you still evolving whether it\u2019s promotion and penetration with diagnostic for commercializing prior generation or lower costs. Therapeutic that might fit better to these markets. The local innovation approach or what sales team like comes if (ph) -- like a customization approach as you look at some of these emerging middle markets, I\u2019d love to understand a little bit more about how that\u2019s going and maybe when we\u2019ll start to see some of the fruit of those efforts? And then I have one follow-up. Alex Gorsky : Sure. Matt, look as you know what I think that there been several phases to growth in emerging markets and I think historically we have taken a lot of our technology from the developed markets and we\u2019ve basically appealed to the higher segments in the emerging markets. And obviously try to adapt those products based upon the commercial model, the distribution system that exists in that particular area. But more and more we\u2019ve realized that our approach is and sometimes actually the unmet medical need is different and so developing the underlying capability or product acquisition, developments and commercialization unique to that entity is something that we\u2019re focusing on. So that\u2019s a major driver behind our innovation center that we focused in Shanghai. We do have R&D centers in both Shanghai and Beijing. I think we\u2019re still in the earlier phases of some of the projects that we have coming out of those, but clearly it\u2019s our goal to develop a much more customized approach for those particular markets. That being said, we still think that there is good opportunity in some of the premium segments across all three of our sectors. So we\u2019ll continue to work those very hard as well. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Great, and then as it may be a little off script here but either its Louise or Dominic, I'd love to understand one of the comments you mentioned on your orthopedic market and your knee business, pricing pressure I think you mentioned in the market softness. Given that you had introduced the rotating platform version of Atune this spring and it seemed like that\u2019s the business that should be firing on at least most cylinders. Can you give us any more colors as to why it came up flat and what we can expect going forward? Alex Gorsky : Yes, Matt, this is Alex again. Let me take a shot at that first and then Louise can certainly add any colors necessary. But as you know we\u2019re one of the first companies to report in this space. So it\u2019s always a challenge to predict exactly how everyone is going to come in, but as we look at our business we think that we\u2019re maintaining share or slightly growing, what we\u2019ve seen is somewhat of a more cyclical trend towards particular knee procedures, we think shifting more to the back end of the year. And if you think about last year and a very robust growth that we saw in Q4 about some of the ways now the patients have a greater responsibility providing their co-payments upfront with the procedures, but that does result in more of a second half of the year affect than early in the year. Again, let me put the caveat in but we can\u2019t say that was certainly, because we\u2019re coming out early on the reporting, we\u2019re going to watch it closely but from what we\u2019re hearing from our people in the field. We don\u2019t think that there is significant share shifts taking place. We continue to get really good feedback on the Atune as it continues to be rolled out. And as you can see from the performance of our hips up 5%, trauma up 7%, you know the core of our business and our teams, we believe are performing well. So that\u2019s our position at this point in time. Louise Mehrotra : I think you covered it very well. Next question please. Operator :  Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Co. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just first for Dominic, you commented two thirds of the 230 basis points of margin expansion a quarter was contributed by OLYSIO, it means about 75 basis points to 80 basis points from the rest of the business. But can you just comment on relative contributions from the pharma medical device unit and consumer units was each a contributor? And then how should we think about our operating margins for the device unit excluding Ortho-Clinical, how much improvement can we expect post divesture going forward? Dominic Caruso : Yes, sure Josh. Well obviously the pharmaceutical business that drove most of our growth this quarter is our best performing business in margin, so obviously they are major contributor. The other two businesses also contributed, I mentioned the lower cost in the MD&D business in particular. I think going forward, it\u2019s difficult to predict for each business because as we develop our plans, we will balance off investment opportunities for each business with appropriate, whether the R&D programs or product launches et cetera. So I can\u2019t give you a specific as to what to expect from each for the business going forward. But for MD&D, the margins ex-OCD should definitely improve, because that was a business that had margins lower than our overall MD&D business. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.: Great, thanks. And Louise, sorry if I missed this, but did you comp the growth of the spine unit and then can you download us on pricing mix for spine in the quarter? Louise Mehrotra : Okay, so the spine unit in the U.S. this is operational growth. In the U.S., it is down 2%, O-U.S. it is up 4% for a worldwide growth up 1% for the total. And in terms of pricing in spine, spine in terms of price in the U.S. only, I don\u2019t have it for the worldwide. The U.S. is down 5% in price with a positive mix of about 1.44% and net for about 3.5% down. Okay, next question please. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.: Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise - Stifel: From a point of optimization, you obviously have made a lot of moves here with acquisitions since you took over acquisitions and divestitures. And I assume you\u2019re going to continue to optimize and refine the portfolio but is there a lot more to come, are you down to a near term, how should we be thinking about it? Alex Gorsky : Hey, Rick thanks a lot for the question. Rick, we\u2019re going to continue to stay very active, particularly where we see great areas of unmet medical need where we think we can contribute and really bring value to the marketplace. I think there are opportunities across all of our segments. We\u2019ve been active as Paul noted earlier in some of the partnerships, in development programs that we\u2019ve been able to bring together in our pharmaceutical group. And we think if there, our agnostic approach of internal versus external sourcing is actually really have been a driver. At the end of the day, we went at that science and I think clearly we are seeing the results of that approach with the success that we\u2019re experiencing. But we are certainly not slowing down, we continue to be very active particularly in the five therapeutic areas where we are targeting. I think if you look across MD&D, there too, we continue to see opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, given our decision several years ago in cardiovascular, we\u2019re going to continue to watch that area very close to augment potentially onto our EEP business, which has done very well.  And we continue to look for other ways in orthopedics as well as in global surgery. Again, where we see great technology that\u2019s either a complimentary fit, has platform potential or may give us an opportunity for vertical integration. And in our consumer segment, another area that we\u2019re very committed to, here too, we see opportunities. We think that we\u2019ve done a very nice job over the past several years of focusing on really what are the key growth opportunities that we have in that segment, and as a result, we\u2019ve done several smaller divestures. We think that\u2019s allowed us to be more focused, more effective, more efficient. But here too, we certainly see opportunities to gain additional scale across different areas of that portfolio. So we\u2019ll remain active, but I think in a strategic level, that\u2019s the way that we are currently thinking about it. Rick Wise - Stifel: Thank you for that. Just a follow-up question on diabetes. Diabetes particularly in U.S. remains challenged, but it was a little less challenged this quarter expected. Are we close to a turning point, when do you think that we get back to even if you will on that and maybe can you follow-up with a little discussion about the vibe rollout, when will we see the full O-U.S. launch and where are you in the U.S. with filings and launch? Thank you very much. Alex Gorsky : Yes, a couple of things. One is, we remain committed to the diabetes space and I think as you know, the significant I think it was 72% price reduction took place in the United States occurred in the first half of the year, so we do expect to be lapping that. If we look at the underlying dynamics of the market, I\u2019d like to commend our team because we continue to see very good performance in SMDG both in the U.S. as well as outside. Also with our insulin pump business, Animas, we\u2019ve seen proving performance. We do have Viario under review by the FDA, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re projecting an approval time at this point, but we certainly think that that's going to offer a nice addition for patients as well as for physicians. And the other important dynamic, Rick is that our diabetes business has also been involved in launch of INVOKANA. And when you consider the strong relationships that we\u2019ve had for a number of years with the endocrinologists, part of our early success with INVOKANA has been because of the way we\u2019ve been able to bring a broader more comprehensive offering to those specialists and frankly that's better for patients that's better for the physicians and better for our business. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Two questions; one, how should we be thinking about OLYSIO trends in 2015, it looks like OLYSIO probably this year is going to sum around $2 billion. Should we think next year closer to $1 billion, I know you\u2019re talking about a decline I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how we should model the decline for 2015 that's my first question. And then second, SG&A came in as a ratio well below our expectations, I\u2019m sorry, way better than our expectations. We\u2019re thinking SG&A ratio somewhere in the 29% to 30% in the quarter it came in at 28%. I don\u2019t think that's a realistic run rate, so maybe help us think about SG&A spend for the rest of the year? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Yes, Glenn. Let me comment a little bit on OLYSIO then ask Joaquin to comment as well. Obviously you saw an uptick in OLYSIO sales in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. We had $800 million in the second quarter. And we noted that we expect competition coming soon at the latter part of the year. So obviously for the second half of the year, we will have competition for OLYSIO that we did not have in the first two quarters. So in terms of modeling, we do expect that the current run rate is not really a sustainable run rate going forward. Joaquin anything else to add to that? Joaquin Duato : Not really to what you mentioned was big competition coming in and different fee regiments coming into the market in the later part of this year. So it sounds like that the current run rate is going to continue. That said we see OLYSIO a very relevant player in hepatitis C moving forward too. And we continue to invest in different clinical trials and clinical data to prove additional flexibility for patients and physicians. Paul described before that the study that we are doing in Phase III with 12 and 8 weeks in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients in combination with sofosbuvir and we plan to continue to do different studies with different treatment regiments to add additional flexibility. Paul? Paul Stoffels : The focus on shortening therapy, as well as increasing Q rates for patients by using multiple different combinations and we are investing significantly in next stage studies. Dominic Caruso : Hey Glenn, just to follow-up on your question about SG&A, we don\u2019t give line specific guidance, but it is true that this particular quarter we saw 200 basis point improvement in SG&A compared to last year. And most of the 230 basis point improvement in pre-tax operating margin was a result of that. And I mentioned earlier that that was also two-thirds driven by OLYSIO. So I think this quarter is a relative low SG&A quarter relatively speaking, but it is an area that we constantly strive to keep an eye on because quite frankly we\u2019d rather invest more in R&D. So if we can spend more in R&D and get more productive R&D investment, we would look to offset that with some lower SG&A spend going forward. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Thanks for taking my question. I have some pharma-directed questions taking advantage of Paul and Joaquin\u2019s presence. I know you guys talk about your commercial execution and I know you spend a lot of money modeling complex markets like the prostate market. Could you just comment briefly with regards to any particular hurdles you anticipate with Aragon 509 as it may be difficult to show mortality benefit in a short trial? And secondly how bigger that market be if you the combined prostate market when you are able to penetrate in the prostate, the pre-metastatic, but high risk category? That's my first question. Thanks. Joaquin Duato : So let me start with the size of the market and may be a good example is how ZYTIGA is doing today. About 60% of the ZYTIGA sales today are already in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Now how big the non-metastatic setting is going to be because as you know we started the trial with ARN-509 in patients with high rising PSAs and noted metastatic is going to be bigger and mostly likely we\u2019ll have a longer duration of treatment. It\u2019s difficult for me to give you an exact dimension of that market, but it will be certainly bigger in terms of the number of patients and the duration of therapy than the metastatic market in each marketing where there is a significant unmet medical need and we are pleased to see that we have been the first in starting a Phase III trial in that legal setting. Paul Stoffels : : Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : And my follow-on question has to do with INVOKANA, just schematically how big an accelerator do you think it will be to have the combination of metformin in INVOKANA a single administration? Alex Gorsky : That\u2019s a great question. We are very mainly pleased with the launch of INVOKANA. As Alex mentioned, it\u2019s been the most successful launch in type 2 diabetes since JANUVIA. And we\u2019re now the leading oral anti-diabetic in type 2 among U.S. endocrinologists. The combination of metformin is a very relevant one. The most relevant combination we have that combination approved in Europe with the name of VOKANAMET and we\u2019re expecting a response from the FDA with the PDUFA date in August. So we think it\u2019s going to be an important element for physicians and we\u2019ll have a significant impact in our business moving forward. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : So, two good questions. First, Alex, I wanted to give you an opportunity maybe to break a tie (ph) here. At the Analyst Day, we heard two messages in MD&D, at least we did. In the morning we heard from a lot of your non-orthopedic segments that there was not significant benefit to scale, and in the afternoon we heard a totally different message from Michelle which is that scale really does matter and do you think scale is going to be a driver of share, can you talk a little bit about your breadth and depth in MD&D? And I wondered if you just help us out your view on scale driving share in medical devices, what is that view and why you think we heard different messages from some of your senior business leaders in the morning sessions versus the afternoon sessions just surely focused on orthopedics? Alex Gorsky : Well, David, I am not sure that the messages were that inconsistent overall. And the way that I would answer that is we do believe scale and size and depth and breadth is going to be important across MD&D. And that has to do with evolving customers right now. I mean when you think about the healthcare landscape going forward whether it\u2019s hospital systems in the United States whether it\u2019s governments in Europe or in the developing markets, we see the opportunity for broader partnerships to be something that customers are both wanting and something that we can definitely provide. Now I think there is not just one flavor, I think it depends on the system, it depends on the specific customer as to what kind of partnership they may want to have, and I think there could be certain opportunities where a customer might look, might desire to look just across the orthopedics portfolio or perhaps the general surgery area to doing a different kind of partnership or other systems who might be a bit more mature might look for something broader across the entire portfolio. So I think that\u2019s likely the difference in messaging that you\u2019ve heard between some of our global surgery and orthopedics, but overall we do think that we see that as a long-term dynamic and something that will be important and frankly one where we\u2019re positioned very well. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you, Alex, and maybe just a follow-up for Dominic. Dominic just given the strength you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year specifically OLYSIO. I guess, we\u2019re a little surprised that there hasn\u2019t been sort of more aggressive reinvestment of that upside, is that, what we\u2019re probably going to see here in the back half of 2014, as you think about next year as we head into this year many investors are focused that if there was going to be in OCD related dilution you would offset that with probably more aggressive buyback activity. As we head into \u201915 is it likely we see a more aggressive buyback activity to offset some of the OLYSIO headwind? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : So couple of comments on the impact of OCD, for this year the OLYSIO benefit does in fact help us absorb the lack of OCD earnings in the back half of the year plus we\u2019re investing in the back half of the year. So our margins overall will not be as significant as you saw in the second quarter because we do intend to invest in the back half of the year for future growth while still overall providing higher earnings that we previously estimated. The share buyback that we talked about regarding the proceeds of the OCD, divestiture we will do that but that \u2013 we\u2019ll see that impact in \u201915 of course because the ability to have an impact of a share buyback this late in the year in \u201914 is very small but that will help us offset the dilution in \u201915, David. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. We\u2019ll take two more questions with respect to everybody\u2019s time. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Thanks for taking the question. One for Alex and a follow-up for Dominic. Just wanted to be clear on what you\u2019re seeing with cardiovascular, I know you\u2019ve said that you have great asset and certainly this quarter shows it was Biosense Webster, are you still very much committed to cardiovascular in more a waiting and watching mode to make the right move or are you more in a decision of trying to figure out whether you are committed to cardiovascular? Alex Gorsky : Kristen, thanks a lot for your question, and let me first of all compliment our EP business and the cardiovascular group for the performance this past year. I believe now we\u2019ve got over 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and when you think of the new technologies like Cardo and others, it\u2019s resulted in great, frankly advancements for patients as well as great growth opportunities for our business. And I would answer your question saying yes, we remain committed to cardiovascular. That being said, we know that we have to be very thoughtful about where we are going to compete and how we might expand our position in that particular market. So as you said, we are doing a watchful waiting. At this point, we continue to watch the other segments, new technologies as they come in seeing what kind of opportunity they may present and we think we will be well positioned going forward based upon how those dynamics evolve. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Perfect. And for Dominic, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about the pricing and Louise has mentioned surgery. Can you just talk specifically about overall orthopedic pricing if that\u2019s intensifying? And then I think for the first time I\u2019ve seen you mention competitive pricing dynamics was envisioned, can you maybe just expand upon there or any other pricing trends within surgery business as well. Dominic Caruso : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll let Louise give specifics on orthopedics pricing, but we did see a continual trend by the way, it\u2019s not really new, a continual trend of negative pricing across the medical device space in orthopedics in surgery. We\u2019ve also seen various competitive pricing dynamics even in the vision care business and we\u2019re comparing this now to last year. So we do see increased competitive pricing dynamics and the market is looking for a lower pricing of products. And in orthopedics in particular this quarter we saw it, and Louise if you have in particular the impact for orthopedics. Louise Mehrotra : So in terms of hips in the U.S., we are seeing a very similar trend of price mix change. So the price is down about 4% but there is a positive mix. So it brings it down to about 3.5%. And in terms of knees, we have in terms of in the U.S., the price down about 2.6% but there is a nice positive impact of mix of about 1.5%, so for a net about 1.1%. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And trauma? Louise Mehrotra : Trauma is a net price. So net price and mix together positive about 2.2 and that\u2019s a small negative in the price about 1% and a positive in the mix of about 3%. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Final question please. Operator : Our final question comes from James Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Jay Olson - Goldman Sachs : Hi, Dominic. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the taking the questions. Couple of quick ones. The first with regard to the Synthes tender and trauma. Can you just help us understand the dynamics behind winning these large tenders and specifically, can they be replicated in other regions? And then how do you prevent these large tenders from being driven by price. Dominic Caruso : Yes, thanks Jay. Again building on the earlier question, we do think this is an opportunity where our breadth and scale is helpful particularly when customers are prepared to deal with a broader offering and this case we are able to provide it. We have definitely benefitted from that and we expect that to continue and other areas of the market continue to transform. And I think regarding how do you keep that from becoming just a pricing issue, I think it has to do with one of the level of innovation that you are bringing forward; two, what\u2019s the overall partnership and solution that you are building with that particular customer that we think would be instrumental in helping us keep good solid growth going forward. Louise Mehrotra.: Thank you very much. And some closing remarks from Alex. Alex Gorsky : So thank you very much everybody and I hope you all agree and as you can see that the diversified business and strategy that we define in our strategic framework that we discussed with you earlier are in fact delivering very strong financial strategic and operational performance and will continue to be the basis to fuel our growth going forward. I couldn\u2019t be prouder the people of Johnson & Johnson and a big difference they make in living up to the mission of our credo, it\u2019s on behalf of the billions of patients and consumers we serve around the world each day. We are very proud to have the honor and privilege of doing that. So I want to thank you all for joining us this morning and I wish you all a great rest of the day. Operator : Thank you.

The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Now, I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion for the third quarter of 2014, up 5.1%. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.8% and currency had a negative impact of 0.7%. In the U.S., sales were up 11.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 1.3%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 3.5%, Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 2% and Europe declined 0.8%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all regions was partially offset by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the impact of divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 9%. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.7 billion and earnings per share were $1.66 versus $1.04 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of $457 million for after tax special items. Third quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $937 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.50, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2013. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represents operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translational impact. I\u2019ll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.3% with U.S. sales down 4.2%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 2.6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was approximately 2.5% with U.S. growth of approximately 1.5% and growth outside the U.S. were approximately 3%. Major drivers of the results were over-the-counter and oral care products offset by the divestiture of the North American Sanitary Protection business. OTC sales growth was driven by upper respiratory products and analgesics. Upper respiratory products grew 10% worldwide driven by sales growth outside the U.S., which included an early seasonal inventory build. Analgesic growth was 7% in U.S. driven by market share gains, partially offset by comparisons to the third quarter 2013 trade inventory build related to the re-launch of the products. In the U.S. adult analgesic market share was approximately 11%, up from 8.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was over 40%, up from 26% a year ago. Oral care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.3 billion increased 18.7%, with U.S. sales up 33.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.1%, driven by both strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products. A major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and EU and SOVRIAD in Japan. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 8%, 14% and 1.5%, respectively. Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA, as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and recently launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX due to generic competition and lower sales of vaccines. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. XARELTO sales were up 68%, compared with the same quarter last year and grew 14.5% on a sequential basis. Total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 14.5%, with cardiology TRx estimated at 23.5%. INVOKANA sales contributed over three and a half points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved 3.2% TRx within the defined market of type II diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 9.2% for the quarter, up approximately 1.5% sequentially. The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of 11%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 33.5% of that market. Continued strong market uptick and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries. I will now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment sales of $6.6 billion decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.5%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the OCD divestiture, worldwide growth was 1.6% while U.S. growth was 0.6% and growth outside the U.S. was 2.4%. Growth was driven by orthopedics and cardiovascular care, partially offset by lower sales in vision care and surgical care. Competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth for vision care. In surgical care, the success of the ECHELONFLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler outside the U.S. was offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products, coupled with U.S. pricing pressure. Orthopedic sales growth was driven by trauma, sports medicine, knees and hips. Trauma was up 3% worldwide due to market growth and new product launches, while the successful launch of MONOVISC, coupled with the continued strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for sports medicine. Hip growth of 4% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were major contributors to the results. Knees worldwide increased 5% due to the successful launch of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure across the regions. Cardiovascular growth was driven by an 18% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to strong growth of the ThermoCool SmartTouch catheter. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter of 2014. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Good morning, everyone and thank you, Louise for sharing the highlights from our performance in the third quarter. We are very pleased with our strong performance this past quarter as well as the progress we've made on our long-term growth drivers. I believe we are well positioned in this evolving healthcare environment. I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some of the progress we've made to advance our business, as well as to review some additional highlights of our financial performance for the third quarter. Then, I will provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2014. But before I do that, I want to comment on what we're seeing in the market for healthcare. Although modest, we have now seen two consecutive quarters of positive momentum in hospital utilization rates, which is in line with recently published analysts\u2019 reports noting the strength. We continued to remain confident that as economies recover and as healthcare reform continues to gain momentum here in the U.S. and abroad, utilization rates are going to increase. At Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019ve continued making very good progress on our near-term priorities of achieving our financial commitments, restoring and relaunching our U.S. OTC products, continuing to capitalize on the potential of the DePuy Synthes acquisition and building on our strong momentum in Pharmaceuticals. At the same time, we\u2019ve continued to focus on advancing our long-term growth drivers, which you're familiar with from our previous discussions. During the quarter, we've made several significant advancements against these long-term growth drivers that are worth noting. We continued to create value through innovation as evidenced by the strong performance of our newly launched products as well as by gaining regulatory approval for expanded uses of important products in our portfolio such as INVOKAMET, which is a combination of INVOKANA and metformin into a single pill to treat diabetes that the FDA approved in August. Further, IMBRUVICA added a third indication in July, when the FDA approved it for use in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who have a specific genetic mutation that occurs when part of chromosome 17 is missing. That's an important advancement for these patients who are considered to have the poorest prognosis and very limited treatment options. The CHMP also recommended IMBRUVICA for approval for similar uses in Europe. And just yesterday, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pharmacyclics to evaluate IMBRUVICA in combination with an investigational PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor as a potential option for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And in our cardiovascular business, we launched INCRAFT Stent-Graft System for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms in both Europe and Canada. Looking longer-term, we continued to make important investments to access early-stage innovation. In the quarter, we acquired Covagen, the company that is focused on developing new therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of inflammatory diseases. On September 30th, we announced an agreement to acquire Alios Biopharma, which will give us a promising Phase 2 potential treatment for RSD, a major pediatric disease with no effective therapy available for prevention or treatment. Their pipeline also includes two early-stage compounds for hepatitis C that could potentially augment our existing portfolio. We anticipate that the Alios acquisition will close later this quarter. And we are also leading with purpose, as demonstrated through our partnership with the NIH to fast-track the development of an Ebola vaccine. Now let's review some highlights from the quarter. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2014, which reflects both the success of our new products and the strength of our core businesses. We\u2019re pleased to show strong reported sales growth in the quarter of 5.1% or 5.8% operationally as we showed you earlier. This growth was driven in part by the continued uptake of our newly launched Pharmaceutical products including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO, which is sold as SOVRIAD in Japan. Please note that this is the first quarter reflecting the divestiture of our Ortho Clinical Diagnostics business. And in order to mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings from the OCD divestiture, you\u2019ll recall that in July we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, our sales increased nearly 8.5% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our hepatitis C products contributed approximately 1.5% of that growth. Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we\u2019ve provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. Adjusted net earnings were $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.5% over the third quarter 2013, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.50 in the quarter versus $1.36 a year ago, which was up 10.3%, exceeding the mean of the analysts\u2019 estimates as published by first call. Profitability from sales of OLYSIO, net of investments we made, contributed approximately $0.06 of EPS this quarter and approximately $0.20 of EPS for the nine months of this year. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the following special items. The net gains associated with the OCD divestiture, costs associated with the continued integration of Synthes, additional reserves for litigation expenses under the DePuy ASR Hip program and an approval for final IRS regulations related to the branded prescription drug fee. Let me now provide some background about the branded prescription drug fee, which we have treated as a special item this quarter. As you know in 2011, we and all participants in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry were required under the Affordable Care Act legislation to begin paying the fee based on our respective shares of branded prescription drugs sold to the U.S. government. The accounting for that fee has been consistently applied by the industry since that passage of the act as agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the third quarter, the IRS issued final regulations, which had the effect of changing the recognition of the fee for accounting purposes from the period in which the fee is paid to the period from which market shares used to allocate the fee are determined. Therefore, we and other industry participants are now required to record an additional year of the fee. Note that as the fee is still payable as originally provided for in the act, there is no resulting cash flow impact. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I'm pleased to point out that we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 120 basis points lower than the same period last year primarily due to our product mix offset by currency impact. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 60 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2013 due to the growth of new products in our pharmaceutical business and overall good management of cost primarily in our MD&D business. These factors more than offset the inclusion of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which I described earlier. Excluding the impact of this fee, which we have treated as a special item, these expenses were 180 basis points lower than in the prior year. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared to the prior year primarily due to timing of various R&D programs that we have and we will continue to make important R&D investments for the future. Overall, our pretax operating margin increased 240 basis points. And excluding the incremental accrual for the additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, pretax operating margins increased 360 basis points. OLYSIO was a major contributor representing slightly more than one half of that increase. Interest expense net of interest income are approximately $112 million was slightly higher than the prior year. Other income net of other expenses was $1.3 billion in the quarter as again, compared to $943 million of expense in the same period last year. Now excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other income net of other expenses show the net expense of $25 million this quarter versus a net gain of $43 million in the prior year. In the quarter, the effective tax rate excluding special items was 24.2% compared to 18.9% in the third quarter of 2013 and for nine months excluding special items, the tax rate was 21.9% compared to 19.3% in the same period last year. This was due primarily to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for the balance of 2014. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17.7 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $33 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $15.3 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major additional acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $300 million to $400 million, which is lower than our previous guidance. And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress. And although that has not yet occurred, we do anticipate that it will be retroactive for the full year when it is eventually passed consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact our effective tax rate by approximately 0.5%. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. This is an increase in our effective tax rate to reflect a higher portion of our earnings this year being subject to the U.S. tax rate. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate. Turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings per share results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in previous quarters. For sales, our assumptions remain consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition in 2014. And for INVEGA, SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year. Further, our guidance reflects net incremental sales from our hepatitis C products as well the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. This is an increase to our previous guidance. Our underlying operational sales growth in this 2014 guidance excluding the impact of the hepatitis C products and the OCD divestiture for the full year 2014 is approximately 4.5%, a higher growth rate than the estimate we provided on last quarter's earnings call. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year than our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 1.5%, reflecting the recent weakening of the euro and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4% and 5% for total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $74 billion and $75 billion. Our 2014 earnings guidance reflects the strength of our performance we've seen thus far including a strong contribution of OLYSIO which as I noted earlier contributed approximately $0.20 to 2014 EPS for the first nine months, net of investments we've made in the business. Therefore we suggest you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.94 and $5.99 per share on operational or constant currency basis, which is higher than our previous guidance. Moving to reported EPS, again we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of this year than our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations. This represents a $0.07 per share unfavorable swing from our previous guidance, with the weakening euro as a major factor. We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range between $5.92 and $5.97 per share for growth rate of about 7% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance, as our strong operational earnings performance is more than offsetting the negative impact of currency movements. And as a reminder, our full year earnings guidance includes intangible amortization of approximately $1.4 billion before tax, or an impact of approximately $0.38 on earnings per share. Please note that our guidance does not include the impact of an official devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar or any other currency. And while we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2015, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for all of 2015, that impact would be a headwind to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. As you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a significant improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels, and approximately half of that is attributed to OLYSIO net of the additional investments we\u2019re making in the business. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results this quarter and with our ability to deliver an even stronger earnings performance for the full year than our previous guidance. Our new products continue to produce strong growth and we are advancing our near-term priorities while also continuing to make investments to fuel future growth. Now I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. And Stephanie, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Dominic Caruso : Good morning, Mike Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So Dominic, first, one clarification, the $0.06, you called out this quarter and $0.20 for the year for OLYSIO, that would seem to imply probably about $0.20 and more of investments netted against that to get to that $0.20 number. So, can you just maybe outline that the $0.20 versus what profitability could have been for that product? Dominic Caruso : Sure, Mike. We are not going to give very specific profitability by product. But generally speaking, when we saw the uptick in OLYSIO sales this year, we knew we had the opportunity to invest more in the business, including both some marketing investment as well as new R&D program. So we expected that we would do that while still having our investors see the benefits of the uptick in the OLYSIO product. So I can\u2019t give you the specifics, but generally speaking about $0.20 for the year. I mean, if you assume that OLYSIO is a high margin -- high gross margin product with very, very little costs associated with it, you can probably estimate what the total impact would be. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: And do you view that $0.20 as one-time, essentially going away next year. Is that you want these rates to be picking up in \u201815? Dominic Caruso : Yeah. I think so, because it\u2019s obvious that we saw such a significant uptick this quarter and you all know that Gilead\u2019s compound in this space was just approved Friday. I think we all expected that. So we took the opportunity to invest. I think we're being very transparent with investors of what the impact to this year's earnings are net of the investments, of course. And yes, we don't expect that that will continue into next year. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: One last question. Could you walk through the assumptions that you\u2019ve laid for this year relative to biosimilar competition? Do you have any preliminary comments relative to 2015? And are you thinking about competition for REMICADE or can you give a product from the portfolio? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Louise, we have spoken before about the fact that 2015 is biosimilar impact for REMICADE in Europe, in particular. Louise Mehrotra : Correct. And as far as INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we are not aware of any ANDA filings on them at this point in time. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Perfect. I will let others jump in. Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Mike. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Larry. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Larry. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about international growth, which has slowed the last couple quarters. The U.S. has obviously been very strong, but can you talk about what you're seeing outside the U.S. and why the U.S. -- O-U.S. I am sorry isn\u2019t growing quite as robustly as the U.S.? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Right. Well, couple things. This quarter of course, we have the impact of the OCD divestiture, so the quarter-over-quarter comparisons are difficult for that. So Europe, I think you saw published operational growth of negative 0.8%. Without the OCD impact, it would've been positive 1% growth. That is slower growth than we\u2019ve seen before. I think you're all very familiar with the fact that Europe is in fact slowing down and we're seeing that across our businesses as well. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : And then Dominic, on Vision Care, it was down 13% this quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color about what's going on there? Is that a market issue? Is that a J&J specific issue? And how long do you think it will take to recover? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Right. Well, we mentioned in the comments by Louise earlier that there is some competitive pricing dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the market for our Vision Care products. So we took the opportunity to price we set, some of our products in that marketplace. We have a lot of new and important innovations coming to market soon. And when we noticed what was going on in the market, we want to price our products competitively with those in anticipation of the new products we have coming in the near future. So I would say there is a little bit of a slowdown in overall market, but the impact you saw for our business was primarily a result of our price we set. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Thanks for taking the question. Dominic Caruso : Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Jami. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Just if you don\u2019t mind, if I follow up a little bit on OLYSIO. So just to be clear Dominic, you said $0.06 net of investments, are you talking net of general investments, or net of investments in hep C? I mean, what is your commitment level to hep C going forward? And given the new pricing around the Gilead combo, it would seem that OLYSIO, even if you cut the price dramatically would have a hard time competing. Are you planning to cut the price and would you expect the $2 billion that you\u2019ve generated year-to-date to just basically go away next year? And then just lastly, back to the margin contribution, I think you were a little bit more explicit on the previous call. I think you had said two-thirds of a 230 basis point improvement was attributed to OLYSIO. If I assume the same thing this quarter, that would have led to about $0.15 contribution and that of course it does not include investments. So if you could just confirm that. And then lastly, I am obliged to ask this, do you have any double Irish exposure? Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Well, let me say, I think I counted eight questions Jami, so I am going to do more. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : I am going to get this opportunity four times a year. Dominic Caruso : Okay. So just to be clear, when I talk about the impact of OLYSIO net of investments, I am talking about net of all investments, not just investments in hep C. So investments across the full range of the Johnson & Johnson portfolio. We are committed to hep C. We continue to do studies in combination with other products. We think there is important new advances still available in that marketplace. We think the market is substantial and it\u2019s worth pursuing. So we are still committed to investment there and we\u2019re doing those clinical trials. As you know, we have already filed with the FDA for our combination of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir and then we have additional data coming out, I think, later this year in addition to that. And then, finally you would ask about pricing given the impact of Gilead\u2019s new pricing for Harvoni, I believe the product is called. And I would just offer the following comments. First of all, we believe that OLYSIO is in fact a very good -- has very good safety and efficacy results, in a strong position in patient experienced to date. We plan to remain competitive in the hepatitis C category and we will work with payers to maintain access for OLYSIO in the marketplace. And given the size, complexity and diversity of this patient population, we think physicians will continue to need multiple treatment options and hence my comment earlier about our commitment to continue to study OLYSIO for hep C as well some other combinations. We think having a potent protease inhibitor available to physicians is important and we\u2019re committed to doing that. As far as Double Dutch or Irish Sandwiches or whatever they are called, I'm not going to comment very specifically about what we do or we don't have but we\u2019ll have to wait to see what the Irish legislation actually says. But we understand from all the comments that have been made by Irish regulators that there will certainly be some grandfathering period for any changes that they propose because they do expect to keep Ireland competitive in the world economy. So we certainly expect that there will be some grandfather period. I don't know how long it will be but we've heard in the range of five years, could be three to five, could be five to seven. But we expect that the grandfathering provisions will give us all enough time to adjust any plans that we might have as a result of any impact. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Glenn. Dominic Caruso : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Good morning. I want to focus on your orthopedics business. Your U.S. knees and your U.S. hips came in a little bit better than we were thinking. So Dominic and Louise, can you provide some commentary about what you see on the U.S side in terms of volumes? Are things feeling a little bit better after kind of a softer first half and then as a follow-up Louise, you mentioned in your prepared remarks pricing pressure. I wonder if you can characterize the pressure that you saw in 3Q compared to how you saw it in 2Q and 1Q? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Well, let me start with just a few comments on volumes. We did see increased volume in the third quarter. Consistent with what we expected where we thought that the second half of the year would be stronger than the first half of the year. Just by the way of reference, last year, our hip and knee growth we experienced 70% of that growth in the fourth quarter. So obviously, we've now seen a new seasonality that\u2019s very clear in hip and knee market. And we\u2019ve seen an uptick in the third quarter or in the back half of the year as we expected, we would see. And Louise on pricing. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. And so just a little further on the market, so we are the first one though but our best estimate of the U.S market growth for the third quarter was hips about 3%. We grew slightly faster and knees about 4%, which we also grew slightly faster. But that\u2019s again, just a big estimate because we\u2019re the first or second one out, depending on how you count it. Regarding price, so in hips this is U.S only, price was minus 5%, which is additional negative by 1% versus sequential basis and mix was virtually flat. So net net price mix in the U.S for hips was down about 5%. For knees, price was negative 2.2% so that's a little better than the second quarter. Mix coming in about 1.5% positive so negative minus 0.6 on the quarter price and mix together and that\u2019s better than the second quarter. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : As a follow-up, Louise, that negative 5 on hips, that\u2019s a big number. Do you have any commentary why negative 5? We\u2019ve been kind of thinking the market overall for hips would be down more 2 to 3 and you\u2019re coming in at negative 5. Was there any contract that rolled off any additional commentary you can provide? Thanks. Louise Mehrotra : Yes. There were some additional contracts that were renewed in the third quarter and that is you\u2019re seeing the impact in that minus 5%. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. And did you want to do spine price in the U.S is down 5% and that\u2019s more negative versus the second quarter. Mix is up a positive of 1% for a negative of 4% altogether price mix for spine in U.S. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, some of the follow-up on your biosimilar comments for next year? So few things, can you help us think about how we should think about the impact of competition in Europe sort of relative to, maybe what you\u2019ve seen with your [Eagle] (ph) franchise and such? And then in the U.S in terms of the biosimilar threat there, last month the U.S. Patent Office issued a final rejection on one of the key REMICADE patents under re-examination? Now we understand that the final rejection still has an appeals process to it? But I was wondering if you could kind of give us some insight into what that appeals process is and how you think about the -- your IP position in the U.S with potential FDA approval of Celltrion, REMICADE next year as well? Dominic Caruso : So, Derrick, thanks for the question. So biosimilars in the OUS first, we haven't seen much of an impact and we know that that even pricing is sort of in the 30% range down from the branded product, but we haven't seen much of an impact of biosimilars in Europe such as Procrit and we\u2019re not seen much of an impact for any other biosimilars as well including REMICADE. In the U.S, you raise a question about the potential biosimilar impact in the U.S because of Celltrion filing. Just as a reminder, we have a patent in the U.S, which goes until 2018 and yes, it's true that the Patent Office recently issued a rejection to that patent, but we have recently filed a revised amendment to that, which is now in the public domain. And until the patent in finally adjudicated, which could go up to the Supreme Court with the number of appellate arguments and appellate avenues that we have available to us. We don\u2019t expect that there will be a final adjudication of the patent for several years now. So whether or not, the biosimilar comes to market in the face of that particular patent situation is up to the competitor. But we certainly continue to believe in the strength of our patents and the validity of those patents and we\u2019re in active discussions with the Patent Office and we will pursue all available appeals and all the available jurisdictions and avenues of jurisdiction that we have to us, which again, I would say, would take several years before they would be finally adjudicated. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up on your utilization comments, you\u2019ve called out the fact that we\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters of utilization pickup on the hospital side of things? Has that -- it didn't look like that really translated to pickup in your surgical sales and I was just wondering if that\u2019s result of -- that being obscured by pricing or some other fact and when will we expect to see some of that utilization pickup be reflected in your MD&D sales? Dominic Caruso : Right. Well, couple of things, I remember, the MD&D sales, surgical care in particular have been impacted by lower women\u2019s health and urology sales. Remember, we withdrew the more selects product from the market. So there is some negative impact related to that. There was also some negative pricing pressure in the quarter. And the overall utilization uptick that we saw was in the very low single digit. So, I mentioned it was modest growth, although encouraging that we saw in two quarters in a row but still very modest, Derrick. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Dominic Caruso :  Welcome. Louise Mehrotra :  Next question, please. Operator :  The next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse. Louise Mehrotra : Morning, Vamil. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse :  Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just couple on the diabetes side here with your SGLT2. Can you just comment what you are hearing from physicians around the differentiation for your product versus some of the competitors that are now in the market? And are you envisioning any tougher pricing dynamics going forward with that class given that there are competitors? And last on the combination with SGLT2 and DPP-4s, can you just remind us if you guys are working on that? I would think that would be good strategy to kind of maintain your position and your competitors certainly are working on those combinations. Dominic Caruso :  Right. Well with respect to the differentiations of INVOKANA to the new competitors, INVOKANA, of course continues to do very well. And the data as you know as filed was a result of something like eight different clinical trials, which should both the safety and the efficacy of INVOKANA, seems to continue to do well even in the face of new competition. So, we\u2019re still growing share even with new competitors coming to the market. We don't see much of a price issue in the marketplace. They are all relatively priced competitively. Remember, this is a very large market and the fact that more SGLT2 inhibitors come to market, we think is good for the market overall because it increases physician\u2019s awareness of the use of that particular mechanism of action. We think the market can withstand a number of competitors. And so we think overall there will be market growth as a result. As far as the combination, I\u2019m not aware that we are actually studying the combination with DPP2 and SGLT2 inhibitor combination. Louise Mehrotra :  Yeah. So INVOKANA was just approved, right, which is combination with metformin. And if you look at the usage of INVOKANA, where about 50% of it is in triple therapies, so they are actually able to get the combination themselves. Dominic Caruso : Right. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks. One quick follow-up, if I could on this because the schizophrenia market, just the LAIs, the growth there was a little bit less than we anticipated. Can you just provide any color there on the deceleration in the U.S. and outside the U.S. this quarter? Louise Mehrotra : I think for our business, the combined, still grew very well, if you take a look at our INVEGA SUSTENNA and Risperdal Consta together. So the U.S. is up 10% due to an increase in combined market share for our growth and that\u2019s INVEGA SUSTENNA and Risperdal Consta together. OUS is up about 3%, so worldwide it\u2019s six in operational levels. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse :  Okay. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go back to orthopaedics, I was wondering, Louise, if you could just provide the pricing on trauma and then I have other questions? Louise Mehrotra : I think someone was going to ask that one. Okay, so for trauma, U.S. only prices 0.5, 0.7 negative and mix was very strong at 2.5% positive, so for net net, a roughly 2% positive. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank :  Okay. And then more strategically just thinking about the Medical Device business, I don't expect you to comment or rumors, but I guess there was some speculation that you guys maybe working where you saw some portions of the quarter\u2019s business. Can you maybe just tell us, Dominic, how you are thinking I guess more broadly about MD&D where you expressed an interest in cardiology more broadly, although have also said about comments on the growth rate there? But has anything changed just overall and the strategic value of having a more broad-based Medical Device business and maybe make some comments in that theme and just a consolidation that you are seeing in your competitors? Dominic Caruso : Right. Kristen, thanks for the questions. So, couple of things, so nothing changed with respect to our overall strategic approach to the space. We are looking at areas where we think there will be strong market growth either because of demographics or because of innovation or because of our own ability to compete in the market, bringing in new technologies with our current presence. As you know, we made the determination some time ago that we\u2019re going to focus on surgery, general surgery, and specialty surgery, and orthopedics and have less of a focus on cardiovascular and we got out of the drug-eluting stent business as we saw that become a commoditized business. Within the overall approach to medical devices, we still believe surgery is the place to be. We\u2019re obviously very happy with our market position there. We made a big bet as you know in orthopedics and we\u2019re continuing to see the benefits of that combination with Synthes. And with respect to cardiology, we believe that there are specific areas of focus within cardiology that are important. And for example, electrophysiology where we\u2019re a leader there and we've seen very good growth, I think nearly 18% growth this quarter from our Biosense Webster business. So nothing has really changed. We believe these are the two main areas within and indeed that we\u2019re going to focus on surgery and orthopedics with selective investments in selective growth areas within cardiovascular medicine. I think our competitors have basically followed suit in terms of these combinations in orthopedics as you know, and there is also combinations along with a current large player in cardiology now acquiring a major player in surgery, again confirming our approach that in fact surgery is the place that we\u2019re going to see sustainable growth going forward. So nothing has changed and I hope that overall picture that I gave you is consistent with the previous discussions we've had and we\u2019re moving along that strategy. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And on the ortho side, we\u2019ve seen the special charges for Synthes continue for longer than I would have anticipated. When I guess will that business be fully integrated and then when will all the one-time charges that are more occurring I guess charges stop for that business? I\u2019ve just been surprised by the magnitude and by how long we\u2019ve been seeing that? Dominic Caruso : Right. Well, we are very careful to integrate this business in a way that wouldn\u2019t be disruptive to our customers. And we made sure that that was our first priority. There is a number of sites that we have to consolidate. These are two very large businesses as you can imagine. So these integration activities are winding down and we should see less of the special charges going forward. And I would say that we\u2019re very close to actually completing the full integration of Synthes. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Right. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso :  You\u2019re welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator :  Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Louise Mehrotra :  Good morning, Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. First, Dominic for you, you mentioned a couple of headwinds for calendar year 2015. I think you said that if currency rates would stay the same, you would see about a $0.15 to $0.20 headwind, that's pretty clear. But OLYSIO, I just want to make sure I understand what the message is in terms of looking forward. Should we think about that as a significant EPS headwind in 2015? Or are you going to reduce the expenditures that you\u2019ve got running through in 2014 or 2015, such that that won\u2019t be a significant EPS headwind in 2015? Dominic Caruso : Right. Well, one way to think about it is that OLYSIO has been a major contributor this year, but we, of course, invested, as I mentioned earlier, some of that upside in the business, so that overall next year when you see a reduction of that contribution overall net-net, it wouldn't be a significant as you might think and that's why, I quoted, the net $0.20 impact for the first nine months. We don't believe that that given the dynamics in the marketplace of this significance that we should overreact and adjust our business too drastically just from one year to the next, considering the fact that we have many investment opportunities, the businesses are still growing nicely and in fact, the overall pharmaceutical business as you know even without OLYSIO is still growing at high double-digit rate. So we continue to bring our consumer products back to the marketplace. So we don't want to really overreact from a big change in a single item that we believe the investment community is very well versed on and so we\u2019ll continue to invest in our businesses appropriately going forward. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. I asked the question just because and I realize it's only one year, but there was couple of headwinds for next year that people are trying to get ahead of from a modeling perspective, so I just want to make sure do you understand all the moving parts? The second question I want to ask was back on your utilization commentary, which did seem more constructive this quarter relative to last? And one thing you\u2019ve comment on the past is your suture business perhaps is a good indication of what's going on from a surgical procedure volume perspective? So I was just wondering if you think your suture business this quarter provided any insight into what's going on, I was just wondering if could just give us a sense as to how much that grew to this particular quarter? Dominic Caruso : Right. So, we said, I mentioned earlier, we did see positive utilization trends two quarters in a row. So we have you two dots we can connect. I guess but these are very, very modest, very low single-digit utilization rate increases and our suture business also had modest low single-digit growth offset by a little bit of price, but overall modest growth. So I think that's consistent with utilization trends we have seen. Louise Mehrotra : Yes. The best estimate from our surgical care group is that the market was flat in the U.S. and then as Dominic said, there\u2019s some negative price on it, and then internationally, sutures grew about 2%, so on a worldwide basis we grew 1. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. Thank you very much. Dominic Caruso : You\u2019re welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Next question please? Operator : Your next question is from a line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Matt. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple, I think, most of the topics have been pretty well covered? But I did want to drill into a couple of comments on orthopedics? In particular you mentioned your estimates for market growth approximately 3% hips, 4% knees, and I realized that we are early about a third of the markets reported? But as you think about U.S. versus Europe, I guess, one of the things in an OUS is a little bit surprising to us is the strength that we've seen overseas? If you can maybe comment on the seasonally slow quarter, how we are seeing things like 6% operating growth for example in knees OUS, if you could highlight a little bit of what you are seeing and then I have one follow-up? Dominic Caruso : Well, Matt, one of things that we are benefiting from is the launch of ATTUNE, our knee platform and it\u2019s been very well as it continued to launch throughout the world and we are seeing significant growth from the ATTUNE launch in Europe in particular, so that that's a major factor that\u2019s specific to our business and not the overall market. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : And then the other would be on sort of the share dynamic and I think about trauma and hips and knees coming together, we\u2019ve all been talking for a long time about the potential benefits of bundling? I am wondering whether you are growing a little bit faster than the market as you commented on, but is any of that coming in the form of either share ahead of some of the strategic or hypothetical strategic actions in this space or just benefits of having a broader bigger trauma, hip, knee offering in orthopedics? Dominic Caruso : Yes. I do think that that we are seeing the benefit of having a broader offering in orthopedics. So we had estimated some sales synergy from combining these businesses and we just got a report recently from the team and we are ahead of the sales synergies that we had expected. So I think the overall combination is working well for us. This is a marketplace as you know where share changes are not very dramatic and they are gradual overtime, but we are seeing positive momentum in that regard. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Nothing on the share gains related to sort of dissynergies or reps jumping ship from some of these other competitors? Dominic Caruso : Well, I think, a little too early to tell that, but we do think that is an opportunity going forward. There will be disruption as we experienced ourselves when we combined our two spine businesses. So we think that will be an opportunity for us go -- on a go forward basis. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Great. Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Welcome. Louise Mehrotra : With respect to everyone\u2019s time, we will take two more questions. Next question please? Operator : The next question is from line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Co. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Josh. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Josh. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.: Good morning. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Just wanted to follow-up on with an orthopedic question on the Ortho unit, you\u2019ve obviously established breadth and scale there. But just wanted to see if you would comment on where some of the weakness in the portfolio is, that\u2019s serving on as an anchor to the overall growth of the franchise? And then also, does J&J need a robotics platform for the recon and/or spine business to compete effectively in the future? Dominic Caruso : Well, let me just say that with respect to the second question, I don\u2019t think we need a robotics platform of our own to effectively compete in the future. We are in fact utilized in the robotic platform that exists today with our products, at the end of factor \u2013 end of the robotic arm. So we do participate in the robotic -- view it as a critical enabler of growth for us in particular. And then, secondly, with respect to the overall orthopedics business, I would say, the only place we saw some softening is in trauma in the extremities portion of trauma. So, lower foot and ankle kind of trauma products, that market seem to be growing more rapidly than the overall market and we have some new innovations coming to market, but not yet there. So we are not yet participated in that growth, but we will be going forward. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.: Okay. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Next and last question, and then we\u2019ll turn it over to Dominic for some final remarks. Operator : Your final question will be from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Louise, just related to ZYTIGA, the U.S. growth rates were actually relatively strong but the international growth rates slowed a little bit, I know it was a very challenging comp outside the U.S. Could you just update us on any dynamics outside the U.S. for ZYTIGA? And then specifically in the U.S. maybe any insight you can give us on competitive share and key patient indications and how you are trending? Thank you. Louise Mehrotra :  Certainly, for the U.S. about 90% of our shares are going through the oncologist and about 10% -- 10%, 11% going through the urologist. In the third quarters, 60 plus percent was in the na\u00efve versus the refractory. And I think what you are seeing in outside the U.S. is just continued new introductions into the market. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra :  Okay. Dominic Caruso : Very welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Some final remarks from Dominic. Dominic Caruso :  Okay. Well, thank you everybody for your thoughtful questions and I hope you will agree that our continued investments and innovations, and our strategic portfolio management are delivering very strong performance and positioning us well for growth moving forward. Well, we couldn\u2019t do that without the great people who work at Johnson & Johnson, I would like to thank them for all they do every day and the contributions they make on behalf of the consumers and patients whose lives we touch around the world every day. So thank you very much for joining us today and have a great day. Operator :  Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

And welcome to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Joining me on the call today, are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site at investor.jnj.com. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing fourth quarter and full year results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2014 results and provide a strategic outlook for the Company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business and review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson Web site, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our Web site. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the Company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the Company and on our Website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies, this slide lists the acknowledgement of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today\u2019s presentations. Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, down 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9% and currency had a negative impact of 4.5%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 7.9%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew 3.9%, while both the Asia-Pacific and Africa region and Europe grew 0.6%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all regions was partially offset by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operation of 0.7% worldwide, 10.7% in the U.S. and 3.6% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $2.5 billion and earnings per share were $0.89 versus the $1.23 a year-ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $1.1 billion for after-tax special items. Fourth quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $42 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.27, representing increases of 1.4% and 2.4% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013. Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2014, consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2014 were $74.3 billion, an increase of 4.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 6.1% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 8% worldwide, 11.6% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, 2014 annual net earnings were $16.3 billion and earnings per share were $5.70. For the year, 2014 adjusted net earnings were $17.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $5.97, up 7.7% and 8.2% respectively versus the 2013 results. Free cash flow for the year was strong at $14.7 billion, up $900 million versus 2013. Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013, unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I\u2019ll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.9% with U.S. sales up 2.5%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestiture, underlying operational growth was 2.1% worldwide, 4.9% in the U.S. and 0.7% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, U.S. Skin Care, as well as Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S. This growth was partially offset by lower sales of Baby Care and Skin Care outside the U.S., due to competitive pressures and prior-year inventory stocking. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products. Upper respiratory grew 8% worldwide driven by sales growth outside the U.S. Analgesic growth was 16% with growth in the U.S. of 24% driven by share gains, as well as trade inventory build related to the re-launch of products. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was 11%, up from approximately 9.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 42%, up from 34% a year ago. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO in U.S. Skin Care, as well as LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 13.9% with U.S. sales up 22.7% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.8%, driven by strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products. A major driver was our Hepatitis C product, OLYSIO. Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 11%, 16% and 7% respectively. Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION and recently launched IMBRUVICA. Net revenue recorded from IMBRUVICA in the fourth quarter was $92 million worldwide, with $64 million in the U.S. On a full year basis, net revenue was $200 million worldwide, with $144 million in the U.S. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. U.S. export sales of REMICADE were down due to timing of shipments to our distribution partners. XARELTO sales were up 58% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to 15%, up approximately 0.5 point from last quarter and up over 4.5 points from a year-ago. Cardiology TRx estimated at 23.5% was up over 4.5 points from a year-ago. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were approximately $200 million in the quarter, with over $190 million in the U.S. contributing approximately 3.5% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. In U.S. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 4.1% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 3.3% in the third quarter of 2014. TRx in endocrinologist grew to 10% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET was the category-leader in new-to-brand share with endocrinologists reaching over 19% at the end of the quarter. Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market at over 15% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 31% of that market down approximately two points on a sequential basis due to increased competition. Continued strong market uptake and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 95 countries. INVEGA, SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved strong result in all regions due primarily to increased market share. I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.6 billion decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 7.7%, while sales outside the U.S declined 2.3%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestures, underlying operational growth was 1.5% at worldwide, with the U.S down 1% and growth of 3.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopedics and cardiovascular care products, partially offset by lower sales in vision care. Competitive pricing dynamics negatively impacted growth for vision care in the U.S. This was partially offset by growth outside the U.S with strong results in emerging market. Orthopedics sales growth was driven by Sports Medicine, hips, spine and knees. The successful launch of MONOVISC coupled with the continued strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for Sports Medicine. Hip growth of 5% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Spine grew 3% with solid market volume growth and new product launches partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Knees worldwide increased 3% due to the successful launch of ATTUNE, with pricing pressure offset by positive mix. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 16% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to strong growth of the ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter of 2014. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the fourth quarter which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2014, on our Web site you will find annual sales highlights by-segment, as well as adjusted earnings before tax by-segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone who has joined the call today. I am really pleased to be reviewing with you the highlights of our very strong 2014 results and a preview of '15 and beyond. But before I get to that, I\u2019d like to start as I often do with just a word on Our Credo. This remarkable document was written 71 years ago by the son of our founder and Johnson & Johnson has long been guided by its principles. And what I can tell you is that this philosophy, this ethos is alive and well in our organization. There is a fixated version of it etched in glass and positioned directly in front of my desk. It\u2019s something we pay a lot of attention to and it challenges our entire Company to ensure that we\u2019re working with the interest of our key stakeholders in mind consumers, care-givers and patients, our employees, the global communities in which we live and work and of course our shareholders. And as we enter 2015, the business of Johnson & Johnson is very strong and we\u2019re well-position for the long-term. We delivered 31 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases, and 52 consecutive years of dividend increases for our shareholders. We\u2019re one of just three companies to be Triple A rated by all three major credit agencies, which continues to afford us many benefits in the financial markets. Our products are industry and segment-leading with 70% of sales coming from the number one or number two market share position and 25% of our sales coming from products we\u2019ve launched in the past five years. And we reward the shareholders by returning about 70% of our free cash flow over the past decade, which amounts to about $90 billion. As most of you know, Johnson & Johnson is built around three core businesses and as the chart on the left of the slide shows, our Pharmaceutical segment generated over 32 billion in sales last year, followed by Medical Devices at 27.5 billion and 14.5 billion in Consumer to round it out. We\u2019re the largest pharmaceutical company in the United States and the fastest growing Company among the top-10 globally. We\u2019re also the market-leader in Medical Devices which includes surgery, orthopedics and consumer medical devices, like vision care and diabetes. And we\u2019re a market-leading consumer products healthcare company as well. And so looking back on 2014 here is a slide I presented last January, that delineated our commitments for the year and I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve achieved our near-term priorities and exceeded our financial targets of full year operational sales growth of 6.1%. We successfully restored a reliable supply of the over-the-counter medicines the shelf in the United States and saw strong growth in our pediatric analgesics. And at DePuy Synthes which showed 3% operation growth over the prior-year led by the trauma, hips and knee businesses, we\u2019ve begun to realize the benefits of the scale and breadth of the combined businesses which have contributed to strategic wins in key markets. And by any measure we built on the already strong momentum in our Pharmaceuticals business, driven by the strength of key products including OLYSIO, XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVOKANA and IMBRUVICA. Later, I\u2019ll cover the progress we\u2019ve made against our long-term growth drivers, particularly in the area of innovation. To set context for our businesses going forward, there are a few points I\u2019d like to make about the dynamics shaping the global healthcare environment. First is the rising cost of healthcare, which by 2020 is expected to account for 21% of the GDP in the United States, nearly 11% in the European Union and 6% in China. And as I travel around the world, it's clear that providing sustainable high-quality healthcare is one of our society's greatest challenges. It's at the forefront of many discussions I have with our associates, government leaders, physicians, hospital administrators and executives at our peer companies. As the world's largest healthcare company, we're working to assume a leading role in the solutions which must be centered on the patient and improving outcomes. Next, expanding access is an important macro trend impacting how we and others think about the future of the business. Healthcare reform efforts and improving economies are clearly helping more people access affordable quality care, which will certainly help in the fight against cancer, obesity and heart disease. And here in the U.S, we\u2019ve seen healthcare utilization rates increase for the second quarter in a row, both sequentially and versus the prior year. And we estimate that we will continue seeing similar to slightly higher growth rates when all of the fourth quarter numbers are reported. Managing those dynamics demand innovation and new models and are driving considerable health industry consolidation at the health system level, as well as in the med tech, pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, where the M&A activity is back to peak levels last observed before 2009. The good news is the governments are increasingly recognizing the need to continue to address healthcare needs and are taking steps to reward innovation through FDA and EMEA designations that are helping to speed product review times. And in thinking about all of these dynamics in the marketplace, today I will cover three themes about Johnson & Johnson that are driving our confidence in the future. First, the core businesses at Johnson & Johnson are strong and positioned to continue expanding our market-leadership positions. Next, we have an exciting and deep product pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we\u2019re changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving our structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth. Now I am also a firm believer that in order to achieve our goals as a Company, it's important to establish a clear set of priorities for the entire organization. Three years ago, when I first assumed this role we were very focused on excellence in execution and given the progress we\u2019ve made today, we're evolving our approach placing an even greater emphasis on innovation and accelerating growth with continued excellence in execution as a non-negotiable part of the process. So without compromise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. In Pharmaceuticals, we'll continue building on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In Medical Devices, the emphasis is on growth acceleration from innovation and also by transforming our go-to-market models that better reflect the reality, the purchasing decisions are increasingly being made at the healthcare system level, as they look to improve the quality of care they provide patients, while controlling cost. And in Consumer, we're expanding our market-leadership in key segments within the over-the-counter medicines, oral care, baby and beauty markets. Let me take you through the thinking of how we will meet these priorities in each one of our businesses. Let's start first with our Pharmaceutical business. I've got to tell you, I could not be proud of this organization. About six years ago we lost $8.5 billion of sales to patent expiry and this was out of about a $24 billion portfolio in our Pharmaceutical business. Now, a lot of companies have chosen different strategies, but what we said is, first of all we want to be very focused on innovation and are developing differentiated products that will ultimately help fulfill unmet medical needs. We focus on five therapeutic areas, recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. And we've also said that we want to go where the best science is and have a mix of internal and external innovation, while being completely agnostic about the source. And the results really speak for themselves. The 14 new products launched since 2009, driving cumulative sales of over $27 billion, six of these products have already crossed the $1 billion threshold. With this we are the industry-leader in terms of research and development productivity and that means per dollar spent compared to the benchmark. And the story is not over, in 2014 we had 20 new line extensions approved and we filed an additional 20. We also started 23 Phase 3 trials and initiated 11 Phase 2 trials. And as currently constituted, our pipeline is poised to yield 10 potential new product filings between 2013 and 2017. Next, our Medical Devices business is in a very strong leadership position particularly in orthopedics, electrophysiology, surgery and vision care, where there is a lot of innovation advancing the standard-of-care. Many of our platforms are overwhelming market-leaders in their categories and 85% of our sales are from platforms with a number one or number two position. We have 10 different platforms in this business that have exceeded $1 billion in sales, which is quite remarkable when you think about it. And we're growing very well in emerging markets and are capitalizing on the scale, depth and breadth of the portfolio we can offer to governments, large healthcare systems and large payors around the world to add value and help patients and we grew sales in China by nearly 15% on an operational basis last year. We've launched over 50 major new products since 2012 and have more than 30 new filings pending as at the end of the year. So again, this is a very strong business that's well-positioned for the future. In our Consumer brands, these are the ones that most people know us by. As you can see we're guided by inside driven innovation and have taken a very focused approach to meeting key consumer need space led by our 12 megabrands. And while they are nearly U.S the OTC business continues to operate in their consent decree they are on-track with all of their commitments and the consistent supply of these products are returning to the market. I am incredibly proud of the work that the team has done and based upon recent market-share trends that show consumption is growing at four times the market, with particular strength behind children\u2019s TYLENOL and children\u2019s MOTRIN, the new strategies we\u2019ve implemented within the organization are really paying off. Now the work that I just described is leveraging the full strength of our enterprise, the product portfolios, the expertise of our research, medical and epidemiological teams and our commercial organizations. Looking longer-term, our strategy for driving growth should be very familiar to all of you by now and I\u2019ll use the balance of my time taking you through some of the elements behind it. So let's start with innovation because in the end without innovation we just can\u2019t be successful that\u2019s ultimately how we\u2019re going to help more patients and consumers and we invested $8.5 billion in R&D last year across our segments to keep us at the forefront. Our approach can be viewed in these four ways. As I\u2019ve said earlier, we want to ensure we have the right mix of internally and externally sourced science and products and we\u2019ve built new innovation models. We\u2019re also focusing on greater cross-segment collaboration to innovate and focused operationally on building market-leading capabilities that enable us to achieve the highest quality and efficiency standards possible across the world. And the good news is, it\u2019s working. We\u2019ve had about an 8% CAGR over the last 20 years and we\u2019ve invested almost $200 billion in innovation over that span. About 109 billion of that has been internal and about 85 billion has been external, so a pretty fair mix. With that external spend, we\u2019ve done over 120 deals and well over 100 of those are under $1 billion. Of course the larger ones make up more of the value, but what this graph shows is that you\u2019ve got to have those singles, doubles and triples as well as the larger home run type deals to be successful over the long-term. And that\u2019s helped us build a portfolio with 24 brands and platforms that generate over $1 billion and sell the piece. As an example, our team has done a great job at this in the oncology space. The partnerships we\u2019ve built since 2008 have helped us grow from a $1 billion franchise to over $4.5 billion today and we have around four breakthrough designations in this portfolio demonstrating our ability to identify and develop products that can revolutionize the care of cancer patients. And we\u2019re doubling down on our efforts to ensure we continue accessing new ideas and products at their earlier stages. Building on the legacy of entrepreneurship that the Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation established since its inception by investing over $1 billion in start-up companies, the team made an additional 43 investments with nearly $200 million just last year. Our new innovation centers which are in four innovation hubs across the world have made over 200 alliances in the past few years and at our four no-strings-attached incubators at Janssen Labs, we\u2019re giving small start-ups places to work and access the instrumentation. I had an opportunity to visit our facility in South San Francisco just last week and that was one of our teams that we\u2019re working with, who says it could have taken them eight years and $300 million to do what we\u2019re enabling them to do in just a couple of years for significantly less, in an environment where they are building a foundation for strong partnerships for themselves and frankly with us as well. As technologies are advancing, we\u2019re seeing more and more opportunities for cross-segment collaborations, bringing together the scientific, regulatory, clinical and commercial expertise from across Johnson & Johnson to improve care. Examples include our EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch, which has demonstrated an ability to control problematic surgical bleeding that goes well beyond the current standard of care. Stem cell therapy for Adult Macular Degeneration is another area that we\u2019re very excited about. We think it offers a great complement to our existing vision care platform. Also while I was in China for the APEC Economic Leaders Summit in November, I announced plans to optimize our expertise on oncology to help the Chinese government fight lung cancer. It's estimated that by 2025 there will be 1 million cases of lung cancer and while China has 20% of the world\u2019s population, they have got about 30% of the cases. So we\u2019re in the process of establishing a China Lung Cancer Center which will adopt an integrated medical approach to transforming the disease we help ultimately into a preventable and curable one, by taking a unique local approach where we have R&D, medical device, pharmaceutical and consumer experts all working together to bring forward new and very comprehensive solutions. This is also a good illustration of the versatility of the types of enterprise-wide solutions we can uniquely offer as Johnson & Johnson and we\u2019re already in talks with governments and other nations to develop similar models to help them attack diseases that are rapidly spreading through their nations. Now we realize that in order to implement programs like these on such a large scale, we must change the way we work as a Company. For many years Johnson & Johnson has been extremely decentralized and we think that accountability and responsibility is something that we don\u2019t want to lose or compromise. But we also realize that operating a $75 billion global company is different than operating a much smaller one and then making sure we\u2019ve got the right standards and systems in place in areas such as quality, supply chain and finance is essential. So we put in a very ambitious agenda to strike the right balance in our organization. And as I stated last year, we\u2019re aiming to take $1 billion out of our P&L over the next three years and believe that we\u2019ll be an even stronger organization. So all of our commitments to innovate have helped us establish a very strong pipeline for Johnson & Johnson. As you can see in our Pharmaceutical business we have a deep pipeline, and as I said earlier we\u2019re expecting the yield 10 major filings and 25 line extensions between 2013 and 2017. One of them is esketamine, a potential breakthrough medication for treatment resistant depression as well as daratumumab which is being developed for multiple myeloma. They both have breakthrough designations from the FDA. We\u2019re also excited by ARN-509, a next-generation treatment for prostate cancer, as well as guselkumabfor Psoriasis and sirukumab which is for Rheumatoid Arthritis. And just yesterday, we announced that the FDA has granted priority review of our NDA supporting the three month formulation of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia. If approved, it will be the first and only long-acting atypical antipsychotic that can be dosed just four times a year, adding an unprecedented treatment option to help address the needs of these patients. We\u2019ll keep you apprised of these programs, as their development progresses. Innovation is also deep in Medical Devices, where we expect 30 major filings between 2014 and 2016, including the ECHELON FLEX Powered Vascular Stapler and our TFN-ADVANCED Proximal Femoral Nailing System in trauma which we\u2019ll launch this year. We\u2019re also innovating medical devices for consumers like the new Calibra 3-Day Wearable Insulin Patch, as well as with our new brand of ACUVUE for use in the beauty and astigmatism and presbyopic segments. And in our Consumer business, we have 20 key product launches planned for this year, including NEUTROGENA Hydro Boost and LISTERINE HEALTHY WHITE. Innovation though is not just about new products it\u2019s also about new ways of managing. More and more of what I\u2019m hearing from hospital CEOs and from healthcare administrators around the globe, is they want to work with Johnson & Johnson on a less fragmented basis, so we\u2019re implementing different approaches. To take on healthcare in the future, we\u2019re going to take a much more holistic approach and build more holistic partnerships and we\u2019re making it easier for health systems to do businesses with us through customer-focused team leaders that can represent an enterprise view. Again, when you think about the depth and the breadth that we have from orthopedics, to surgery, to the pharmaceutical group, our ability not only to contract, but to fundamentally partner price and work collaboratively in a different construct, it offers us a unique and exciting opportunity to be part of the solution in healthcare as it continue to change around the globe. We also have a very strong global footprint and 53% of our total sales last year were made outside the United States, with about 21% in the fast moving emerging markets around the world where we see stronger growth rates than what we\u2019re seeing in developed markets. While these markets always represent a certain challenge or a certain risk, we\u2019ve been operating in them for many years and we believe that taking a long-term view is the right way for us, not only in terms of expanding our presence, but also in the way we conduct research and development and the way we embed elements of our supply chain in all the areas of our business, which is an important strength for us overall and which is helping us to drive us to this level of success. Now while we\u2019ve talked a lot about ways in which we\u2019re building our portfolio, we also think it\u2019s important to make sure that we\u2019re being thoughtful about where we\u2019re going to participate and where we\u2019re not going to participate. Again, you\u2019ve seen some decisions that we made around areas such as drug-eluting stents, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, selecting pharmaceutical and consumer brands. Our approach is to focus on being number one or number two in a particular area, as well as on those businesses or product areas, that we feel have a path to achieving leadership where they will be directly complementary with one of our businesses. Now if a business or product doesn\u2019t meet at least one of those criteria for us, it maybe that it\u2019s better served in someone else\u2019s hands. To be clear, these can be very good businesses with a lot of opportunity such as the U.S. NUCYNTA pain brand, we just announced plans to divest or Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. The point is, that moves like these give us a chance to rejuvenate our portfolio and to focus on those programs that we know are ultimately going to help more patients and grow our business. One other topic I\u2019d like to talk about before I close regards our efforts around Ebola, now in addition to the privilege of working in healthcare, we have a real responsibility to lead with purpose and to help the global community in times of crisis. Our work to expedite development of an Ebola vaccine is a great representation of our ability to mobilize and focus our resources in a really short period of time to help meet the needs of patients. And because everyday counts, we\u2019ve committed to substantially accelerate the production of our vaccine regimen through unprecedented collaborations among the global health community. Our goal is to bring this vaccine to families and frontline healthcare professionals, as fast as possible. We started our Phase 1 clinical trials and have produced more than 400,000 regimens for use in large scale clinical trials. As I started this talk, I showed you a slide for my presentation last January, outlining what we expected to accomplish in 2014. So, we\u2019ll remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers. And I look forward to reporting on our progress next January when we view our 2015 accomplishments. As I close, I just want to emphasize why I\u2019m so confident in our business and our growth potential. First, our core businesses are strong and positioned to continue expanding their leadership positions. We have an exciting and deep product pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we\u2019re changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving our structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth. Finally, I\u2019m privileged to work with some of the greatest people in the world and I believe that with the progress we\u2019ve made a sheer commitment to Our Credo and resolve in pursuit of our aspiration to help billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives we\u2019re extremely well-positioned for the future. Thank you and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CFO, Dominic Caruso. Dominic Caruso : Thank you, Alex and good morning everyone. It\u2019s a great pleasure to report on our excellent 2014 performance which was driven by the many successes that Alex previously discussed, as well as to provide guidance for you to consider as you update your models for 2015. Now let\u2019s review some highlights of our full year and fourth quarter financial performance. Turning to the next slide you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2014. At the beginning of 2014 we provided an outlook of our expected financial performance for the year and we saw continued improvement in our results throughout the year. That growth was driven by strong sales results, particularly in our Pharmaceutical business and also good expense management across the enterprise. And so we ended 2014 with full year sales growth of 4.2% with operational sales growth of 6.1%, which exceeded our initial guidance of 4% to 5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures our operational sales growth was a strong 8% for the year. While we did benefit from a significant level of sales of our Hepatitis C products, excluding both of these factors our operational sales growth for 2014 was approximately 5%. I am also pleased to report that our pre-tax operating margin for 2014, excluding the impact of special items, improved by 190 basis points with more than half of that coming from sales of OLYSIO. Finally, our net income margin excluding special items improved to 23%. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014. While our total sales change of negative 0.6% reflects a negative impact of currency movements, we\u2019re pleased to report operational sales growth of 3.9%, which as Louise discussed earlier was driven impart by the continued uptake of our recently launched pharmaceutical products. Excluding the impact of Hepatitis C products and acquisitions and divestitures operational sales growth was 5.6% for the quarter. Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. I am pleased to point out that we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 40 basis points lower than the same period last year, primarily due to our product mix and cost improvement actions partly offset by currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were down as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 as favorable mix of the business was partially offset by investments made in all areas of our business. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was up compared to the prior year, as we continue to make important investments for future growth and we closed a number of exciting licensing deals in the fourth quarter. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin excluding special items decreased 60 basis points in the fourth quarter, as compared to the prior year due to the timing of these investments during the fourth quarter. Interest expense net of interest income of approximately 122 million was slightly higher than the prior year. Other income net of other expenses was $963 million of expense in the quarter compared to $868 million of expense in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are included in this line item, other income net of other expenses showed a net gain of approximately 103 million for the quarter, versus net expense of approximately 47 million in the prior year. In the quarter, the effective tax rate excluding special items was 8% compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and for the year excluding special items tax rate was 19.3% compared to 17.2% for 2013. This was primarily due to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the federal R&D tax credit for all of 2014, which we had anticipated would be passed Congress and in fact was late in 2014. This was included in our guidance but not yet in our reported results, therefore the entire full year credit is now reflected in the results for the quarter. Now turning to the boxed section at the bottom of the slide, during the fourth quarter we recorded several special items that netted to an approximate $1.1 billion charge on an after-tax basis and consisted primarily of the following items; increased litigation accruals, cost associated with the Synthes acquisition which is consistent with what we expected will be incurred as special items throughout 2014 and which we expect to continue through the middle of 2015 as that integration activity wraps-up and some charges for in-process research and development. Together, these special items negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.38 per share. Excluding these special items our adjusted earnings per share were a $1.27 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by Firstcall despite the increased currency headwinds in the quarter which I will discuss later. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. I\u2019d like to start by first providing some context which we believe is important to consider regarding our guidance for 2015. First, as a reminder as we discussed last year and although we took opportunity to invest in the business with the increase in profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments. Also as we did throughout 2014 we will provide a view of our sales growth excluding the impact of Hepatitis C, as well as acquisitions and divestitures, which as you know are both important when considering the underlying base business performance. Additionally, currency headwinds have increased quite substantially since we last spoke with you in October of 2014, negatively impacting both sales and earnings and our guidance for 2015 to a greater extent that we had anticipated. We know that that some of you have updated your models for currency, but many of you had not yet and even though that have updated for currency have not yet reflected a negative impact that current rates could have if they were to remain at recent levels for all of 2015. And finally, we have decided to exclude amortization of intangibles from our adjusted earnings guidance consistent with the majority of our competitors and which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I\u2019ll give you some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the year, we had approximately $14.3 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $33.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $18.8 billion of debt. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I\u2019d suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes the anticipated gain from the divestiture of our U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine. As announced last week, we anticipate this transaction to close in the second quarter. This is a higher level of other income and some of you may have modeled and higher than the prior year level and we expect to use this increase in other income to compensate for lower level of income from OLYSIO, which we expect in 2015 as compared to what we had in 2014, allowing for continued investments in our core business primarily in research and development. Now a word on taxes, our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will also be renewed by Congress for 2015, although that has still not yet happened. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015. Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. For sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. We are however expecting the generic entrant for INVEGA in the first half of 2015, as well as biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe in early 2015 and have included the expected impact in our sales guidance. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the impact of Hepatitis C would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014 which we noted earlier. Throughout the latter part of 2014, the euro, like many other currencies weakened significantly versus the dollar and as of last week was lower by approximately 11% as compared to 2014 average levels. As you know, the dollar strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 5.5% reflecting the recent weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range between negative 3.5% and negative 4.5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $71 billion and $72 billion. Now turning to earnings, consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors, beginning in 2015 we will exclude intangible amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings guidance and actual results. The impact of the amortization of intangible assets that we\u2019re projecting is approximately $1.3 billion on a pre-tax basis representing approximately $0.32 per share on an after-tax basis for 2015, compared to $0.42 per share in 2014. The amount for 2014 includes the acceleration of the amortization expense on certain intangible assets which we don\u2019t anticipate for 2015 at this time. To assist you in comparing our guidance to our models and to our prior year results, I will first describe our adjusted earnings guidance excluding special items as we have done in the past. Then I will update that guidance but also exclude the impact of amortization of intangibles. A significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which although hedged is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 50 to 70 basis points in 2015, as compared to 2014. I will of course discuss the translation impact of currency on EPS in a few minutes. Consistent with our prior year presentation of adjusted EPS excluding special items, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS excluding special items ranging between $6.22 and $6.37 per share on a constant currency basis, up approximately 4.2% to 6.7%, compared to a constant currency sales growth rate of 1% to 2%. Now excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles in addition to excluding special items, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range between $6.54 and $6.69 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 2.3% to 4.7%. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week then our reported EPS excluding the intangible amortization expense of special items would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.42 per share, a much higher negative impact that we provided back in October of $0.15 to $0.20 per share due to the significant strengthening of the U.S dollar during the past several months. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS guidance excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items would be in a range between $6.12 and $6.27 per share, reflecting the significant headwind of currency on EPS, if exchange rates were to stay where they are now for all of 2015. At this early stage in the year we would comfortable with your models reflecting the mid-point of this range. So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided and reflecting on the context I shared with you earlier, I would like to make a few key points; although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2% we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of Hepatitis C and acquisitions and divestures our operational sales growth at the mid-point of our guidance would be 6% for 2015, as compared to 5% for 2014. We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will replace the lower level of income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, allowing for continued investment in the business particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipeline. The negative impact of currency exchange rates in 2015 as compared to 2014 will be much more significant to both sales and earnings that many of you have modeled. And we expect that this additional negative currency impact to be more significant in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year. On a constant currency basis our operational EPS growth and our guidance is expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. And finally going forward as we noted today, we will be reporting our adjusted earnings per share to exclude intangible amortization expense, as well as special items consistent with the majority of our competitors. So in closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong results for 2014 and we have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near-term priority and to continue to deliver solid results, while also continuing to invest for long-term growth and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you and now I\u2019d like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the program. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. To assist you with updating your models with comparative 2014 adjusted EPS excluding intangible amortization and special items we have posted a reconciliation by-quarter to the Web site. We will now open the call to your questions. Lhea, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Let me ask two to Alex. Alex let me just start off with the nearly 14 billion in net cash that you have that\u2019s close to the largest for J&J in recent years but you\u2019ve been relatively, you\u2019ve done relatively small deals since taking over as the CEO. Is there any color you can provide on your appetite to do a larger deal and your priorities for M&A? And then I have one follow-up question for you. Alex Gorsky : Larry consistent with our strategy, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities frankly that help us better fulfill unmet medical need and so if we start with our pharmaceutical area I think over the past several years we\u2019ve done a really nice job of identifying compounds early on in that development, things like ZYTIGA, things like ibrutinib, bringing them in, putting them through a very rapid and extensive clinical development program and then of course having successful launches. And as we've experienced 14 new product launches since 2009. So we think in the pharmaceutical area that kind of approach to sourcing new technology and new compounds is definitely a successful one. If we look to our Medical Devices, of course our big focus over the past in making sure that we're making the most of the significant investment that we made in Synthes. And I think we made a lot of headways I outlined during my presentation and in fact I think we were one of the first companies to really look hard at spaces like orthopedics and recognize that consolidation was very likely to occur and so we were able to do that in a way where we feel we got a very good portfolio fit. And as we\u2019ve managed through that transition over the past several years, we feel that we're in a very good position now particularly as many of our competitors are just starting to go through some of those consolidation initiatives. But even in this space we continue to look for new options, new innovations. There is number of spaces, we\u2019ve identified areas such as orthopedics, such as surgical, such as vision care in particular to be significant priorities for us and we continue to look in those spaces. If we look to consumer, our top priority over the last several years frankly has been on remediating our over-the-counter brands, particularly here in the United States. And I really commend the team for the great work they have done. The McNeil Group has basically completed the major steps, the consent decree so they are on a very good path, they are re-launching brands you see it in our results for the quarter. But here too we continue to look for ways to innovate, continue to look for ways to add scale and expand in the appropriate way. And of course while we're doing that we're also making sure that we're being very disciplined and decisive about businesses that we're choosing not to participate in. And I think we made a number of moves over the last several years that also has allowed us to continue to invest, but has also been healthy for the shareholders at the same time. Lawrence Biegelsen : And then Alex I know this may seem like an overly simplistic question, but over the past 15 years J&J\u2019s pharma business has gone through three, roughly five year cycles with the first five being strong, followed by a deceleration due to patent expiration, followed by another five strong years or so. And when one looks at the pharma business one can't help but see increasing competition to key products like ZYTIGA and STELARA, as well as the biosimilar competition that you highlighted on the call which will slow your overall pharma growth. So my question is how confident are you that you can break those five year cycles we've seen over the past 15 years and why? Thanks. Alex Gorsky : And look I am very proud of our Pharmaceutical business, and frankly the work that they have done over the past five or six years to address as you highlighted the significant patent expiry challenge that we experienced and that we successfully navigated our way through. When you think about it, we lost about $8.5 billion to patent expiration several years ago and we took a determined strategy that frankly was different than a lot of our competitors where we decided to focus on five major therapeutic areas where we had capabilities and frankly where we still felt there was a lot of unmet medical need. We got very agnostic about the sourcing of our research. At the end of the day we wanted the best molecule, the best science where we felt we could make the biggest difference and then of course it was about how do you build robust clinical development programs and then ultimately have benchmark commercial and reimbursement teams to make sure that you are maximizing all of those compounds. And if you look at the track record as I mentioned earlier, 14 compounds since 2009, six of those have reached a $1 billion and again these are compounds that are really making a difference for patients. But at the same time, we have made a very strong commitment to make sure that while we were launching those, we were also investing in the future. And here I really want to commend our scientific team, our business development team because if you look at our near-term pipeline I think it's quite encouraging. We've got things like ARN-509, another approach in androgen receptor inhibitors that we think will be a great compliment with ZYTIGA in the not too distant future. To complement an already very strong immunology franchise with REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI, we have got sirukumab an IL-6 in patients for RA and guselkumab an IL-23 that's an antibody for psoriasis both of those are progressing very well through development stages as well. We have got a very interesting compound fulranumab an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain. We have been in pain for some time, but we think this will be a definite new approach for patients and we've also got esketamine, you have heard some of the data on that. It\u2019s the first NMDA antagonist and these are from patients with treatment-refractory depression, a really difficult condition with high rates of suicidality. And we see very good results, again it's early, we have more work to do but we're quite encouraged. So if we add that to the very strong platforms and you\u2019ve heard earlier in my presentation that we\u2019ve had over 20 line extensions approved in 2014 of our existing compounds, we\u2019ve submitted at least that many more that we\u2019ll see approved over the next several years. And when you look at some of the areas where we\u2019re currently participating, be it prostate cancer, be it Type 2 diabetes and some of the other areas such as thrombosis we\u2019re seeing many of these areas growing at double-digits and areas like XARELTO, I think we\u2019ve penetrated perhaps a third of the warfarin market. So we think there is strong growth opportunities in our core business, we think we\u2019ve got exciting line extensions and we think we\u2019ve got a great coming pipeline of Phase 3 and Phase 2 compounds for the future. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein. Derrick Sung : Alex, you spent a lot of time highlighting the successes that you\u2019ve had in pharma which we would agree you\u2019ve done a great job and seemingly finding kind of secret sauce there in terms of both external and internal innovation. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on how translatable that formula is over to your medical device business, which has continued to -- you struggled to grow above market and maybe could talk about if there are any learnings there that could be translated over to Medical Devices and what it will take either internally or externally for you to get that Medical Device business growing above market? Alex Gorsky : And first of all, clearly we acknowledge our Medical Device Group has faced challenges that many of the businesses have over the past several years and we\u2019ve got some very promising and I think very strong stories in our Medical Device Group and when you think about our EP business BioSense Webster and the growth rate that this experienced, I think we\u2019d now -- we have about 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth for that business, a continues and constant stream of innovation, ultimately really helping patients in growing our business, it's impressive by almost any measure. I think we\u2019ve also started to see some of our other core businesses come back and grow. We think about the Medical Device market probably growing in the 3% to 5% range, it's been consistent with our longer-term projections. Of course our goal is to outpace that growth because we want to gain share vis-\u00e0-vis innovation, the way we work with customers in our broader portfolio. If I look across other areas, we\u2019re starting I think to see signs of a strengthening orthopedics performance by DePuy Synthes. For example we saw hips up around 4%, knees up 3%, trauma growing at the high 4s, almost 5% and we think our share performance has been very good in all of those different areas. We saw energy also on a full year basis come back over 5%, even our Suture business is growing over 3% on an annual basis. So we think those are strong performers and can continue. And then of course we have some businesses that we\u2019re working hard on, areas such as diabetes which as you know was challenged by the price setbacks, our Vision Care business is facing challenges in the marketplace, but they have done a lot of good changes recently and we think they are well-positioned for the future. But as we look even longer-term, clearly we\u2019re trying to take pages from the innovation playbook that you might say our pharma group is built on and apply those in other areas. So whether it's in our clinical development programs, the way we monitor safety, adverse event reporting, those are areas we\u2019re spending a lot of time. We\u2019re doing more and more through our innovation centers that we\u2019re recently opening and utilizing JJDC on how do we better source early start-up innovation. Again in the pharma as well as the device but even our Consumer businesses going forward and of course we\u2019re looking at ways also to partner with customer in new unique ways. So, we remain confident in our Medical Device businesses, we\u2019ve got some very strong businesses, we\u2019ve got -- we realize there is others that we still have more work to do, but we think long-term they offer a significant opportunity for patients, for us and for our shareholders. Derrick Sung : I was wondering Alex also if you could follow-up a bit on your comments on healthcare utilization. You\u2019d mentioned that now you're seeing a couple quarters of sequential uptick in healthcare utilization. Can you perhaps break that down a bit by geography and give us your outlook and also what you're seeing in the U.S. versus Europe versus the emerging markets and how you -- what you see the drivers are for utilization as we look out to 2015 and beyond? Alex Gorsky : As you know because of our presence in pharmaceuticals, as well as devices and even consumer it gives us a pretty good lens to understand what\u2019s going on fundamentally in the market. So let me start in the United States where you probably have the clearest and the most tangible data and here we\u2019re encouraged, we think we\u2019ve got about three quarters now in the positive, when I say in the positive I mean somewhere between 2% and 3% when we\u2019re looking at hospital admissions, surgical procedures, physician office visits still appear to be negative. So I think it's too early to declare complete victory yet, but generally I would say we\u2019re encouraged by some of the signs that we\u2019re seeing and if we can see the fourth quarter, the full results coming out for this year and have a third quarter then of increasing results that would be a positive. I think one of the areas of challenge for us has been Europe. There remain obviously a lot of concerns economically in Europe. We have some businesses frankly that are doing quite well. We have others that are challenged. I think it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. We continue to see good growth in China on a full year basis. We saw over 10% -- double-digit growth in China and close to that in the BRIC regions although obviously with Russia, that\u2019s been particularly challenged over the last year given some of the things that we faced. South America a little bit more with Venezuela. Brazil has been a little bit mixed. We saw some challenges on our Consumer segment and some of the other areas. We haven\u2019t felt that as much, but I think that\u2019s a global sense that we give you. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : So Dominic let me start with you if you don\u2019t mind, so I just want to walk through the kind of approach to numbers this year, so you have starting point for on a cash EPS basis of $6.39 for 2014, but then you lose $0.42 in FX let\u2019s call it $0.20 from OLYSIO, but then the other income step up from '14 to '15 adds extra $1 billion gains of about $0.30, is that how to think about it? And then and if that\u2019s right it would still seem to imply relatively conservative underlying EPS growth outlook of about 1% to 3% so is there anything I\u2019m missing there? Dominic Caruso : I think the impact of the higher other income and expense line I mean you have to think about that as utilizing the tax rate that\u2019s predominantly U.S. versus our blended tax rate I would say that the impacts lower than $0.30 a share and closer to $0.20 to $0.22 a share. Just think about a $1 billion at a 35% tax rate and 6.50 and do the math on that, so I don\u2019t think you get the 0.30 on that, so I would adjust that a little bit. And then I would just give you maybe another macro observation Mike and that is that if you -- I know that not everyone has updated their models for all of the moving parts here, but I think if you -- when I look to consensus at about 6.14 and then I consider the fact that we should add back to that $0.32 of this amortization expense and then reduce it by what I\u2019m using as about $0.24 which is the difference between $0.42 that I just discussed and the midpoint of what we provided as an estimate back in October between $0.15 and $0.20 so that call that 0.18, so an incremental $0.24. So 6.14 plus 0.32 minus 0.24 gets you to in the 6.20 range. And so we\u2019re thinking that that\u2019s about apart from the expectation on currency about where everyone had sort of expected us to come out. Mike Weinstein : But with the let me fast forward then into 2016 so, we should assume that that level of other income benefit fade in 2016, so is that a bit of a headwind as we\u2019re trying to update our model going from '15 but to '16? Dominic Caruso : Well I think that as Alex has talked about and I\u2019ve mentioned in other calls and you all have asked us about, we\u2019re continuing to review our portfolio. We expect that we will continue to make choices of that areas we\u2019re going to play in and areas we\u2019re not going to play in. Where we want to invest and where we think others certain assets maybe better in the hands of others. And when we do that and we divest certain businesses as a result of that analysis, we tend to use those divestiture gains to basically benefit shareholders. So we either use it to invest in other more promising activities that we think will give us a better boost in long-term growth or in fact we deliver a higher level of earnings as a result and of course as we did with OCD, if there\u2019s any dilutive impact of that on a go-forward basis we would then adjust for that with share buybacks and alike. So I would say that, I wouldn\u2019t take '15 as sort of an abnormal number and I wouldn\u2019t just say would fade into '16, it all depends on what choices we make when we evaluate our portfolio going forward. Mike Weinstein : Let me ask one if I can sneak in one bigger picture question so if I pick up your noise from OLYSIO the underlying growth in the business is accelerating in your guidance for 2015, could you just comment on that so what businesses are you assuming get better between pharma and medical devices and consumer? Dominic Caruso : Yes well overall I would say that the growth rate in pharma ex-OLYSIO will be slightly softer than it was the prior year as these products have now ramped up in the marketplace. So the medical device business overall and the consumer business are expected to have better growth prospects in '15 than we saw in '14. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Two questions for Alex. First, Alex can you describe your commitment to your cardiovascular device business? And the reason I\u2019m asking is that there was something written up a few months ago that J&J maybe thinking about selling the interventional cardiology business but not the electrophysiology business, so commitment to Cardiovascular. And then as a follow-up, what is your commitment to the Triple A rating, in other words how sacred is the Triple A rating? And the reason I am asking that is because as your competitors are getting bigger and bigger is better according to some of your competitors, if J&J were to see a deal that was larger but it would sacrifice the Triple A rating, would J&J do such a deal? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Look Glenn I think that if you ask me about cardiovascular my response is that, we think cardiovascular is an important area. We have done very well over the last several years in our EP business as I mentioned earlier. And I think by any standard if you look at the way they have been able to advance the standard of care, if you take a look at the new technology, the innovation rollouts and frankly the execution of that business it has been superlative in just about every mark, and we\u2019re really proud of that. We made decisions in other areas of the cardiovascular, such as our decision on drug-eluting stents several years ago. We\u2019ve continued to look at emerging areas in cardiovascular, but I think overall we want to participate in areas where we\u2019ve got technology that we think can really make a difference for patients, where we think the markets are promising for the future in terms of reaching more patients, expanding share, volume growth, some pricing stability. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate our portfolio to make sure that we\u2019re consistent with our strategy and as it relates to cardiovascular. If we talk about our Triple A, look we\u2019re proud of the fact that we\u2019re only one of the handful of companies that still have Triple A rating. It gives us a lot of financial flexibility. As an organization when you realize that we literally have almost no covenants, and the way that we\u2019re able to manage our business for an enterprise of our size and frankly for the sustainability of our performance over a very long period of time, we think that\u2019s important. However, what we would also say if we came upon technology that we felt was truly transformational that opened up new patient segments for us, new opportunities that is one factor that we would consider as we think as we would think about different acquisitions or different opportunities. So it\u2019s one among many factors, it is very important to us, but it\u2019s not the only factor that we would judge a strategic option by the future. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Halford, Jefferies. Jeff Halford : So we are seeing quite of contracting pressure in some areas of pharma. I just wanted to get a bit of color from you whether XARELTO is a product that you are potentially starting to get any more serious discussions with Eliquis becoming a much more penetrated within the U.S. market? And then also just INVOKANA as well just what the situation is like there? Just from a contracting perspective. And then second just give a bit more color on what kind of impacts you have expected within your guidance for REMICADE within Europe from biosimilars? And then just lastly if you can just give us a bit more color on the increase in the litigation accrual you described in your release? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Let me start off with the first one and then I\u2019ll ask Dominic to chime in on the other couple of questions. And first of all, we take a very broad look in the very early stages of our compound development on what potential impact or scenarios we could face regarding pricing and reimbursement, and so it starts very early with the science. And as I mentioned earlier in my commentary about our pharmaceutical strategy, we think taking a very high innovation approach in pharma is the right approach and it certainly has been the one most successful for us. And so part of it starts with selecting compounds that we feel have a strong probability of differentiation versus current standards of care and we think that\u2019s certainly the case with XARELTO and INVOKANA. Secondly it really gets in your clinical development programs. And if you look at the XARELTO clinical development program that we had, I believe we had more than 60,000 patients as part of our plan, extensive studies as you know we have got more than five indications for that, literally at launch or very soon thereafter once-a-day dosing. And so as part of our development program and the labeling we had a very comprehensive approach. And we think that that clearly played a strong role in its rapid launch uptake. And I think the same for a drug like INVOKANA. If you take a look at the comparative labeling that we have versus Januvia regarding HbA1c reduction, regarding weight loss, other parameters, that\u2019s enabled us to have a very differentiated and strong dasia to share with decision makers, payors around the world. So as a result what we think now not only have we seen strong acceptance but we have seen good formulary uptake. XARELTO for example in the United State is available on I believe more than 90% of the commercial as well as Medicare and Medicaid programs. We see the very strong uptake with INVOKANA, I think it\u2019s somewhere around 70% or 80% even in most cases. And we\u2019ve had good success outside of the United States as well. And so we think it takes again a very good clinical development program, strong labeling, very strong reimbursement and commercial expertise. And so that\u2019s the way we think about those compounds. We haven\u2019t seen additional pressures as of late but we certainly see competitive pressures. But we feel very good about our compounds that we\u2019re frankly still in the launch stage of and their potential for future growth, Dom? Dominic Caruso : Yes Jeff, with respect to REMICADE in Europe as you know we don\u2019t provide specific product sales guidance on any product and particularly with REMICADE in Europe as you probably know Merck is our partner for distribution in Europe and the countries affected by biosimilar competition in the beginning of February 2015. So I think the question is best posed to them. One thing I would say though is that we have a view on how biosimilars are likely to unfold in the marketplace which is unlike how typical generic chemical compounds unfold in the marketplace. And our best experience there was with PROCRIT and Eprex in Europe. So using that as a guide, we felt pretty comfortable updating our guidance to reflect our expectation of that, but we won\u2019t give very specific guidance on any product in particular. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Dominic, I just wanted to just go back and reconfirm the other income commentary. So you are including the gain from NUCYNTA and going forward you said it would be likely that we would continue to see these gains on the sale of asset divestitures. Is that correct? Dominic Caruso : Right. And so we did include that in this year\u2019s guidance and in response to Mike\u2019s question where he said would it fade off in 2016 I commented that consistent with our review of our portfolio and making decisions on where we\u2019re going to invest and where we\u2019re not, if we decided to divest other assets as part of that review then we would have similar type transaction gains in the particular year. And we would highlight them to you as we\u2019re doing today. Kristen Stewart : And this year $0.20 to $0.22 just for that after-tax? Dominic Caruso : I think if you look at the change in our guidance on other income and expense compared to what you all have modeled it\u2019s about $1 billion after-tax of 35% gets you to about $0.20-$0.22 per share impact versus current models. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just kind of I guess more business operational. Can you just talk a little bit just about the surgery business you highlighted it has being a key area of focus within Medical Devices with some new products coming up. Can you just refresh us on your stance on robotics and what products you have within the pipeline that you\u2019re most excited about in 2015? Alex Gorsky : Look, we\u2019re excited about the broad area of surgery and as you know we break it out both by specialty surgery, as well as surgical care. And what I would start within specialty surgery, there is a number of areas that I think are great opportunities one is certainly energy. We\u2019ve had a number of new launches this year that I think have resulted in about over 5%-5.2% full year growth rate in that franchise. We think there is a lot of opportunity going forward. We also saw very good performance from our Mentor business this year it grew it almost 9% after a couple of years of a lot of challenges. It came back strong and so we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen there. And finally our bio-surgery business, which is the one that we also think can really revolutionize the way bleeding is controlled intraoperatively. We saw over 8% growth in it for the quarter, so by and large that segment of our surgical business is doing well. There we\u2019re continuing to address some issues at ASP but our team has made a lot of headway there so we\u2019re confident about that platform as well going forward. If I look more broadly in our other surgical business, we saw suture grow over 3% which was nice year-on-year growth in that particular area. We think that\u2019s a good pre-cursor of what you see generally across all of surgery in the ENDOPATH area or ECHELONFLEX portfolio is also being introduced and is doing better. Clearly in certain areas there we\u2019re facing pricing pressure. But overall, we think that the surgical area both in specialty as well as more general surgery offers a significant opportunity for us. Kristen Stewart : And with respect to robotics? Alex Gorsky : Regarding robotics, look as Gary mentioned during last year\u2019s review of our Medical Device space, we think the areas of robotics visualization particularly if some of those components become more inherent to the instrumentation of themselves. We do think that they can offer opportunities. We\u2019ve got several partnerships there as we speak. And we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to think about how that\u2019s going to impact surgery going forward. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Alex more a kind of a high level question on international if we think about the last three years '13 growth rate\u2019s a little slower than '12-'14 growth rates looks slower than '13. Even the second half '14 was slower than first half '14. Given you\u2019re kind of focused on global reach can you just describe why international is decelerating, is it emerging markets and what\u2019s the strategy to turn that around? And then I have a quick follow-up? Alex Gorsky : Look there is a lot of different moving parts so let me talk about it. I think first of all let\u2019s talk about Europe, in Europe we saw contraction initially then Europe actually performed better. As I mentioned earlier in the guidance going forward we\u2019re watching it closely and even there you\u2019ve got Southern Europe versus Northern Europe. We continue to see Northern Europe performing slightly better than the rest of Europe it\u2019s been impacted in the most recent quarter by Russia in a significant way. So that\u2019s a watch out although we have had some of our businesses such as our consumer group do relatively well in Russia. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching closely. China we continue to see pretty solid growth for our businesses our Medical Device business is the most significant in that they may continue to see good growth there. Our consumer group has had some other challenges that we don\u2019t think necessarily are related to the macroeconomic environment and frankly they have to do with some of our own products and ingredients. But we think that we\u2019re on a better path there. And then if I look to South America we\u2019ve been most challenged there, in Venezuela. Brazil definitely we feel there was some slowdown in the back end of the year. And we\u2019re just going to have to watch it closely as we head into 2015. Dominic Caruso : David just one thing to remind you about when you said it slowed down further in the back of '14 compared to first half of '14 just a reminder that the divesture of the OCD business would have impacted that comparison as well. Alex Gorsky : Yes. David Lewis : And maybe just a quick one for Dominic and then a strategic one for Alex if I can sneak that one in, Dominic just I know it\u2019s hard with all the moving pieces do you have any sense of what you consider the underlying operating margin expansion to be for the business in 2015? And then Alex just strategically just thinking to your comments in the slide deck this morning is it safe to interpret your comments that within pharmaceuticals, oncology probably sees an increase relative investment over the next couple of years relatively to historical periods? Thank you I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Dominic Caruso : Sure David just in terms of operating margin expansion in '15 just to set the stage for you, remember we expanding our operating profit margin by 190 basis points in 2014. So we\u2019re already at a pretty high level and we wanted to continue the investment and we said we would use the divesture gain that\u2019s included in our OI&E number for NUCYNTA to offset the lost profitability on OLYSIO and by doing that we\u2019re going to maintain the level of investment that we now have achieved. So an incremental operating margin expansion in 2015 would be very modest. Alex Gorsky : And David I would say we are really focused on all five of our therapeutic categories. Oncology is certainly an exciting one and when you look at the science and what\u2019s happening there we think that there is a lot of opportunity to better address need for patients. We think there is a lot of very interesting science, but also when we look at immunology when we look at infectious disease, when we look at neuroscience, as well as broader spaces in cardiovascular and diabetes, we think that all of those offer significant potential for us. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise, Stifel. Rick Wise : Alex maybe as a start a little more detail with diabetes if you would it\u2019s been underperforming asset maybe just broadly what do you need to turn around and let me touch on a couple of points. Remind us when you had received the price cuts, Vibe approved and launching here we\u2019ve heard great things about it in Europe. Is that going to be a good product feed for what we expect to see in the U.S and maybe you had a picture of the caliber patch? Remind us when you hope to file and get that approved and launched in the United States? Alex Gorsky : Diabetes is clearly one of those areas Rick where you know and we would add several conversations on this. There are 350 million Type 2 diabetics around the world and so many of them not in control. There is a lot of unmet need. But we also realize it\u2019s been a very challenging market particularly in the areas of the part of the market that we\u2019ve been in for the last several years. So Louise is going to get the exact date when we lapped it. Louise Mehrotra : The price changes went into effect about a year ago June. But you\u2019re still seeing the impact of them and you saw them earlier in the year and you\u2019re still seeing some of them. Alex Gorsky : And look for a very significant portion of our market we saw over a 70% price reduction and as you know whenever that happens in one of your businesses you frankly have got to reframe that entire business. And I think all of the companies involved in SMBG have gone through that kind of transition over the last year and a half. If we look at the underlying fundamentals things such as volume share, we\u2019ve actually done a very good job. We\u2019ve done a very good job in managed care contracting. So as a result we\u2019ve been able to keep our volumes up, our costs under control. But nonetheless that business is completely had to reshape itself and there are still in the process of I think getting it stabilized. We are excited about the Vibe approval. We think that\u2019s going to represent a real nice breakthrough for patients over in Europe we\u2019ve had strong results. We\u2019re putting together the launch literally as we speak, so we\u2019re excited about that. We think Calibra could be a very nice opportunity very unobtrusive way to have insulin delivery. And it looks right now by the year -- backend of the year 2016 we should have more on that. So again overall diabetes is an area that we feel strongly about and by the way this is the same team that had a very significant role in the launch of INVOKANA as well. And we think the relationships that they have built with the endocrinologists have been quite important for us in the long success of that brand as well. So it's an area that we're interested in but clearly one that's changed and we still have more work to do to make sure we understand the best path forward. Rick Wise : And Dominic just one question for you, the $1 billion cost reduction program it sounds like the new one -- newly incremental one if I understood you over three years. Just help us briefly where did that come from, what operating lines does it affect and is it incremental or you reinvested? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : We actually talked about it last year at this time as well, so it's not a new program, it's just the same program we discussed and we're confident that we will get about a $1 billion over the next three year period. It's in the area of IT, finance, HR all the functions that support the businesses, how we perform those services, where we perform those services and as Alex mentioned earlier some more standardization and commonality across the businesses through shared service environment. You\u2019ll see it across the SG&A line in particular but we would always look to see what the right balance is of investing versus delivering those cost savings of course we do expect pricing pressure to continue so this was a good hedge against that as well Rick. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Just a follow-up to an earlier question I think from Jeff on INVOKANA and XARELTO some of the contracting issues. Just curious about the specialty care markets so certainly the TNFs and you are going to see obviously a lot of discussion on pricing and primary care and have seen but are you seeing anything more in the specialty care areas specifically in autoimmune how has that changed kind of over the last six to 12 months from what you have seen before? Alex Gorsky : Alex here, we haven't seen any significant changes over the last six or 12 months. And again we've got a lot of experience in those areas with REMICADE, SIMPONI, and STELARA. And I think the team has done a nice job in managing the overall value of pricing and reimbursement issues but we haven't seen any noticeable changes in that environment. Vamil Divan : Okay. And then just one follow-up if I could is on the tax side. We had the lower rate this time and you mentioned for '15. How should we think about just longer-term tax planning, I mean is the range you are giving now, what would you kind of assume going forward are there other steps that can lower your longer-term rate? Alex Gorsky : Well I think Vamil we're always doing prudent tax planning and I think the ultimate change in tax rates would come from hopefully corporate tax reform being implemented. In which case if you project that I would then project a slightly higher effective tax rate and of course the utilization of all U.S cash et cetera without penalty is a great benefit that arises from that. So I can't give you a long-term projection but you have seen that we've been sort of in the 20% range for quite some time and that I think it's a solid place if you just want to model it for now. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. And we will take our final question from Danielle. Operator : Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy, Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : As we -- so appreciating all the headwinds that are impacting growth in 2015, how do we think about sort of medium-term growth for '16-'17. And what's in the pipeline to return the Company back to growth this is sort of following-up on Larry's question Alex on specifically the pharma company and going through a few years of strong growth and a few years of decelerating growth. What's in the pipeline that gives you confidence that 2015 is sort of a one-off where you observe headwinds from OLYSIO specifically and then of course FX? Alex Gorsky : Look I would say first of all, we think that there is significant growth left in our core brands. And as I mentioned earlier whether you look at the penetration that you have within a particular therapeutic category for Actavis the new novel mechanisms in against warfarin for example. If you look at the penetration of the SGLT2 versus other options in diabetes and frankly the growth rates of the market in areas such as prostate cancer or some of the leukemias, we think there is a lot of growth opportunities just from reaching more patients. Number two, it's about getting additional indications and line extensions. And so I think our team has done also a very nice job there in continuing to reinforce introducing new data, new information, new approaches, that whether it's combination therapies, whether it's something like our three month version of Paliperidone that we just announced that we know in a condition such as schizophrenia could have a tremendous impact if you can keep compliance high on just four injections a year. We think I in that core business it gives us a very solid opportunity with the line extensions. And then of course if we look beyond that, some of the compounds that I mentioned earlier, we think ARN-509 will be a great complement with ZYTIGA and we\u2019re learning more and more about that and we\u2019re becoming increasingly confident as we gather more data. In immunology, our IL-6 and IL-23 with Sirukumab and Guselkumab will be great additions to a portfolio where we\u2019ve already got three compounds and we know very well clinically, we know very well commercially as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And finally, Esketamine, while still early, we\u2019re very encouraged by the data, we really are encouraged by the fact that we\u2019ve seen whether we\u2019ve received breakthrough therapy designation as well as Daratumumab in pain. So we think those in addition to our line extensions and additional indications that we\u2019ll be gathering, remember we filed more than 20 different line extensions over the course of 2014. We have 11 compounds in Phase 2 development, I think we\u2019ve got 50 compounds in early development more than 100 in discovery in addition to the ongoing licensing flow that we were able to build this year, I think it gives us a lot of confidence in our portfolio going forward. Danielle Antalffy : And then if I could just follow-up really quickly with the question on the device side of things, so obviously we\u2019re nearing a close of one of your competitors or two of your competitors emerging and a mega transaction here making a big bet on breadth and scale across the hospital and bundling et cetera. So just wondering how you guys are planning to respond to that, how you think the environment could change from a purchasing perspective at the hospital level with the Medtronic Covidien deal once it closes? Alex Gorsky : Yes I guess what I would say Danielle is we wouldn\u2019t respond to that necessarily, I think we initiated probably some of it with our move several years ago, when we started down this path ourselves. And we\u2019ve been pretty steadfast on our strategy one it's about innovation and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to invest in innovation in all of our core Medical Device businesses. We do think that having scale in the right areas is also important as payors, and as hospital systems want to deal with you differently. And then it's about having also a very good geographical presence so that you can expand globally. And we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to add the right new technology or the right business to ours and that\u2019s the path that we\u2019ll stay on. Alex Gorsky : Okay. Alright everybody thank you again for joining today\u2019s call and together with Dominic and Louise I look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress over the course of the year and I am sure we\u2019ll be talking on several different occasions. So please note that we\u2019re going to be hosting a pharmaceutical business review for analysts on Wednesday, May 20, 2015 right here in New Brunswick and then it will include a review of our overall strategy for continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline much of which I talked about today. So I look forward to seeing many of you there. Enjoy the rest of your day everybody. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Rick Wise - Stifel Josh Jenning - Cowen & Company Jayson Bedford - Raymond James Operator : Good morning. And welcome to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for first quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing first quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the Company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the Company and on our website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Please note our 2015 sales schedules, breakout sales for both IMBRUVICA and INVOKANA/INVOKAMET to assist in updating your models we have also provided the quarterly split for 2014 for those products on the sales schedule by product. Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015, down 4.1% versus the first quarter of 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.1% and currency had a negative impact of 7.2%. In the U.S., sales were up 5.9%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 0.8%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 13.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 9.9%, while Europe grew 0.3% and Asia Pacific Africa declined 3%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C completion or growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operational growth was 5.7% worldwide, 9.1% in the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.64 a year-ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $226 million and a net gain of $128 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.56, representing decreases of 5.9% and 4.3% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translations significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings grew 3.7%. Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 3.4% with U.S. sales up 3.8%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 3.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 4.7% worldwide, 5.1% in the U.S. and 4.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, Skin Care, as well as Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics, upper respiratory products outside the U.S. as well as new products and re-launches in Digestive Health, Anti-smoking aids and ROGAINE. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12% up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. paediatric share was nearly 43%, up from nearly 38% a year ago. In Skin Care seasonal inventory build and strong market growth drove results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.7 billion increased 10.2% with U.S. sales up 16.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.7%, driven by both strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products. New competitors in Hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying pharmaceutical growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 13%, 24% and 3% respectively. U.S. results include a positive adjustment for growth to net including managed Medicaid rebates. Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA as well as INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, XARELTO, IMBRUVICA, ZYTIGA, CONCERTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. Regarding REMICADE export and international sales, as a reminder the company made certain supply changes resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales being recorded as international sales. Combined international and export sales for REMICADE in the first quarter of 2015 were down approximately 2%. Strong growth in Canada was offset by lower sales to our distributors reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe partially offset by an inventory build. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 40% on a sequential basis. In the U.S. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 4.9% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and Metformin, up from 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologist grew to 11.8% for the quarter, and 4.3% in primary care, up 1.5% and 0.7% respectively on a sequential basis. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET remains the category-leader in new-to-brand share with endocrinologists at nearly 18% at the end of the quarter. XARELTO sales were up 38% and total prescription share of TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anti coagulant market grew to 15%, up over 3 points from a year ago. TRx and primary care reached 12% and in cardiology 23.8% up on a sequential basis. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of Commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. Strong patient update with new indications approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. primarily Europe with launches in Germany, France and the U.K.  Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC market at 12.5% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 30.3% of that market down approximately 1.2 points on a sequential basis due to increased competition. During the quarter the FDA approved a label update for ZYTIGA plus prednisone noting significantly prolonged median overall survival compared to placebo plus prednisone, in chemo-na\u00efve men with mCRPC. Continued strong market uptake and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 95 countries. CONCERTA growth was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalent reclassification of generic competitors. INVEGA, SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved strong result in all regions due primarily to increased market share. I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.3 billion decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.1%, while sales outside the U.S declined 3.3%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestures, underlying operational growth was 1.3% worldwide, with the U.S up 1.1% and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopaedics, cardiovascular care, surgical care and diabetes care partially offset by lower sales in vision care. Competitive pricing dynamics and buying patterns negatively impacted growth for vision care. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in Sports Medicine as well as trauma hips and knees partially offset by competitive and pricing challenges in the U.S in spine. Trauma growth of 3% Worldwide was driven by 7% growth outside the U.S. due to strong volume growth including a tender. Hips growth of 3% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. up 2% due to strong sales of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure. Outside the U.S. knees were down 1% with growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America offset by lower sales in Europe. Slowing elective procedure volume primarily in the U.K contributed to the soft sales in Europe. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 12% worldwide increase in Electrophysiology business due to strong sales of the ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter. Surgical care growth was driven by strong future growth and the success of new products in the ECHELON FLEX family partially offset by lower sales in Women\u2019s Health. Results for diabetes care were driven by ANIMAS strong double digit growth with the successful launch of VIBE in the U.S. and expanded paediatric indications outside the U.S.  That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2015 and I believe we are well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. At Johnson & Johnson we continue to make very good progress on our near term priorities as well as our long term growth drivers which we discussed during our January call. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to highlight some key developments we\u2019ve made to advance our business as well as some key points regarding our results for the quarter and then I\u2019ll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2015. During the quarter we had several key developments across our business. We received new approvals for IMBRUVICA, PREZCOBIX and VELCADE in our pharmaceutical business and also added a new anti-thrombin antibody to our early stage development pipeline through the acquisition of XO1 Limited which we announced last month. We also continued expanding our efforts to combat major global public health challenges through collaborations with government organization and others in the industry to search for new solutions to stand the threats posed by dementia and Ebola. In much more in-depth preview of the outstanding work our pharmaceutical business is doing will be provided at our upcoming pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 20th which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In Medical devices in line with our priority to accelerate growth through innovation we announced in March definitive agreement to collaborate with Google Life Sciences to advance development of a surgical robotics program which we see as an important step in our commitment to advancing surgical care around the world. Finally we continued making disciplined decisions regarding the management of our enterprise portfolio and completed our divestiture of the U.S. Licensing rights for NUCYNTA in April. We announced the binding offer from Cardinal Health to acquire our Cordis business which we expect to close in the latter part of the year. Please now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. We are very pleased with the strong start to the year as reflected in our first quarter results. While overall sales results were impacted by currency headwinds our operational sales growth was 3.1% and our operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a strong 5.7%. Competition in the Hepatitis C market negatively impacted that growth by a full percentage point. You may recall that this same analysis for 2014 resulted in underlying operational growth of 5%, so we are very pleased to see underlying operational growth accelerating and very healthy. Now if you please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 exceeded the mean of the analyst estimate as published by Firstcall. The decline in adjusted EPS of 4.3% versus the prior year was entirely due to the negative impact of movements and currency rates in the translation of our results, particularly the weakening of the euro compared to the prior year. This resulted in a negative impact to EPS in the quarter of approximately $0.13 per share. EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.69 or up 3.7% over the prior year. This is slightly higher than our operational sales growth rate of 3.1%. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures the 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items which consisted primarily of the following. Intangible asset amortization expense was approximately $200 million, net litigation gains were approximately $250 million and we had an increase in the accrual for the DePuy ASR Hip program of approximately $100 million. Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased 30 basis points; this is mostly due to currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 27.9% of sales or 70 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2014 due to good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.9% and it was higher than the prior year, as we continue to make important investments for the future. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.6% or 50 basis points lower than the prior year primarily due to such R&D investments. Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. And other income and expense was a net gain of $348 million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $86 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $91 million compared to a net gain of $50 million in the prior year period. Now excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This effective tax rate is higher than our previous guidance as it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that legislation has not yet been passed. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $12 billion of net cash which consist of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I\u2019m also pleased to report that we have made significant progress and nearly completed our share repurchase program which will offset the ongoing impact of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics divestiture we did last year. For purposes of your model and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I\u2019d suggest you consider modelling net interest expense between $450 million and $550 million; this is unchanged from our prior guidance. Regarding other income and expense as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a gain ranging from approximately $2 billion to $2.1 billion, which includes the gain from the divestiture of our U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine which we announced close in the early second quarter and we\u2019ve updated our guidance now to reflect the anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business. As we noted in January, we expect to use the increase in other income to compensate for the anticipated decrease in income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014 while continuing to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth. We firmly believe that continued portfolio decisions are an important process and enable us to focus our resources on the highest growth opportunities. With the anticipated Cordis gain we will be able to mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year. The increase in guidance for other income and expense will flow directly through to increase operational earnings versus our prior guidance. And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress, although that has not happened. We therefore will be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. This is higher than our previous guidance reflecting changes in the mix of our earnings. If the R&D tax credit is not approved it would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015. Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. Consistent with our previous guidance for sales our assumptions for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are expecting the generic entrant for INVEGA in 2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe following the patent exploration in many countries in February. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Consistent with our previous guidance we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2014 our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of Hepatitis C would be approximately 6% a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014 which we noted earlier. As of last week the euro was lower by approximately 17% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar has strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And though we are not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7% reflecting the weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions which although hedged, is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 to 70 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014. Consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors as we explained last quarter we now exclude intangible, amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings guidance and actual results. Accordingly, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.64 to $6.79 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 4% to 6%, this is higher than our previous guidance by $0.10 per share reflecting some operational improvements and the higher other income and expense I noted earlier partially offset by higher tax rate. Again, we are not impacting \u2013 we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, that our reported earnings per share would be negatively impacted by approximately $60 per share, which is a higher negative impact of approximately $0.18 per share than we provided in our January guidance. Therefore our reported adjusted EPS range will range from $6.04 to $6.19 per share primarily due to the increased headwind of currency on ESP of $0.18 per share which is partially offset by our improved operating performance of approximately $0.10 per share. At this stage and year we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. So, in summary as update you models for the guidance that I just provided I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2% we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of Hepatitis C products, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is approximately 6% for the full year 2015 as compared to 5% for all of 2014. We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will mitigate the lower level of income from OLYSIO into 2015 as compared to 2014, and allow for continued investment in the business particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipeline and now with the inclusion of the gain from the Cordis divestiture we are able to offset some currency headwinds to earnings as well. With regard to earnings on the constant currency basis our guidance on an operational EPS growth is strong and in the range between 4% and 6%. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter of the year and we're pleased with what we see for the full year namely strong underlying sales growth, solid operational earnings per share and the benefits of the decisive portfolio actions enabling us to fund investments in future growth opportunities and also help us mitigate some of the currency headwinds. Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. And Andrea, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Mike. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thanks guys taking my questions. So Dominic, the first question you'll probably going to have is the FX headwind obviously has gotten worse over the course of the last few months, and you reflected that in the guidance. You're helping manage through 2015 with the gains from NUCYNTA and Cordis, but that won't help you for 2016. So we're a long ways away from there, but obviously the question is, can you grow earnings in 2016 after the gains you'll be taking in 2015, assuming the dollar holds at least? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Mike, it\u2019s a good question and let assume the dollar holds and there isn't further currency headwinds. Yes, we did purposely offset some of the OLYSIO income we saw in 2014 with now this benefit from the divestitures that we talked about and are very transparent about in 2015. I would say, with a business of our size $70 billion to $75 billion in sales, we actively manage our portfolio and we would expect that we would continue to do so and as we talked about before, look at the businesses that we expect to not be in and make the right portfolio choices and take the size of actions and that will further enable us to refocus our resources in the right areas. So I think, although I can't predict the level of other income we would have in 2016, I wouldn't expect the drop off so dramatically. And secondly, as I mentioned our sales growth is accelerating, our business has been managed well by all of our business leaders around the world. So I'd expect continued sales growth and increase profitability from those sales as we move forward. So, more to come and we'll obviously keep you posted throughout the year. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Let me ask two kind of balance sheet, capital allocation questions and one, you and I discussed this a few weeks ago in our call, but I know lot of you like questions on the back of the press reports on Pharmacyclics and Abbey's acquisition there and JNJ's potential involvement. So I won't ask you to comment on JNJ's involvement, but can you talk about the companies thinking about larger M&A particularly in the pharmaceutical space, but really across portfolio, the appetite for larger M&A at this point. And then, second, I'd be interested just in your comment on the back the GE activity on Friday. As you're aware, GE is part of its move to slim down to being more of a pure industrial company to offset some of that dilution announced that they were going to repatriate $36 billion in cash that was sitting outside the U.S. to fund the stock buyback, that doesn't help your discussions with the Washington about getting the holiday or more meaningful change in tax laws to allow you guys to access that cash. So, with GE being this very high profile and U.S. multinational repatriating all this cash, does it change your thinking at all about how you're managing your cash balance all of which sits outside the U.S? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Mike. There's a lot there. So let me start with the first half which was about, I think the appetite for large acquisitions and I won't comment on rumours or speculation about our involvement in the Pharmacyclics. I think just to take a step back our capital allocation policy remains the same and we have for a long time emphasize dividends as the first use of our capital and we believe that's the most enduring return to shareholders and we've demonstrated over now 52 consecutive years of increase in dividend. And then, it was up to me and others in our business, we'd invest all of the remaining free cash flow and value creating acquisitions whether they were large or small. I think the key point here is the transaction value creating regardless of its size, so our appetite doesn't really change in terms of whether or not an acquisition is large or small our view of acquisition is being value creating has to do with the disciplined approach we take to evaluate an acquisition and whether its large or small we're not going to overpay for an asset. Typically, large acquisitions are difficult to generate value from because either over valued by the market or significant premiums required or the asset is already substantially mature enough where you can add much to it. But I would not necessarily read into any of our discussions or actions as being necessarily adverse or favorable towards any size particular size or transaction. And it's true that over the long period of time the majority of our transactions have been below $1 billion actually, but we've done as you know with the transaction and important strategic moves that are significant on the $20 billion range. So hopefully that provides you some insight there. On the repatriation question, we're still firm believers that the ultimate conclusion here is a much more competitive corporate tax system in the U.S. I can't speak for what GE did but this not alter our view that its currently uneconomical to repatriate those earnings at such a high corporate tax burden and we'd much rather see our government move in the direction of lowering that tax burden for corporation, getting that cash back to the U.S and invested more appropriate without the burden of this extra tax spike, but I can't comment on why or whether we would do something similar as to what GE did. Mike Weinstein : Thanks, Dominic. It\u2019s very helpful. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Yes. Thanks so much for taking the questions, just a couple on the pharma side here. One you mentioned as we run guidance and how you're thinking about 2015 with PROCRIT and other products. Just any thoughts by biosimilar REMICADE in the U.S. and is that anyway factored into your thinking for the rest of this year? And then, on the oncology side, one area we hear a lot of focus on for lot of companies is immuno-oncology and I just wondering if you share any thoughts, I know you have your pharma business everyday [ph] coming up little bit here, but any thoughts you can share with that as you kind of ready for these big oncology meeting, you're focus on getting more involved on the immuno-oncology side? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Vamil, well, our guidance for 2015 does not assume any biosimilar competition in the U.S. We remained confident in the strength of our patents and obviously we're pursuing all available avenues to protect our intellectual property, but we're not expecting biosimilar competition 2015 in the guidance that I provided. In terms of oncology and immuno-oncology in particular our teams have done very, very good work here in the next generation of immuno-oncology and I think it\u2019s a best to save any further comment to the experts and you'll hear from them and see them in action on May 20. And I encourage you all to hear what they have to say, I think you'll find it very exciting. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry? Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope you can hear me okay, I'm on the cell phone. Louise Mehrotra : Yes, we can, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Great. Let me start off with first, it was good to see the acceleration in the consumer segment, I thinking it was about 4.7% organic growth. Dominic, can you talk about how sustainable that is? Dominic Caruso : Sure, Larry. Well, thanks for pointing it out. We're very pleased with the consumer businesses progress over the last several years actually and now we're seeing that progress result in higher sales levels, for couple of reasons. I think overall the market is healthier in consumer spending is what we see. We also have made important innovations in that consumer healthcare particular in skincare and we see skincare doing really well and we continue to invest behind it. And then finally we made great progress in the OTC business in terms of resolving and remediating the issues around the consent decree. We're complete with all of those particular actions, although we still need to wait for final FDA certification, but now that allows us to more freely ship product from those plans. We can do so on a consistent basis. We're happy to see that was those products hit the shelves they go quickly, we're happy to see that we're able to replenish the shelves in a more consistent basis. So, we believe consumers are off to a great start in 2015 and we're expecting more continued positive results from the business going forward. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Dominic. On the Q4 call you said you'd expected consumer and devices to both accelerate in 2015. And as you noted we saw consumer accelerated in the first quarter, but we didn't see devices accelerate. So, do you still expect devices to accelerate in 2015 and if so what drives that? Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic Caruso : Yes. Thanks, Larry. Thanks for the question. Well, let's take a minute to just put the medical device results for the quarter in perspective, of course, negatively impacted by the divestitures and as we said about 1.3% growth without that. But underlying that there's a few issues there that I think is important to point out. One is we existed the women's health business recently. We also have seen these, the negative impact of the price reset in the Vision Care business, so that's a drag quite frankly year-over-year, and also the continue headwinds that we faced in our diabetes business as to pricing. When you exclude those factors and you sort of normalize, but what's really happening in the underlying business, it's growing at approximate 3% or about equal to the market. Now, going forward the medical device business as we describe last year in the medical device day has a number of new product launches 30 new product that we're expecting the launch by 2016, some of them have already began the launch. So, we're very optimistic about the fact that the medical device business will return to grow especially ones we lap some of these comparisons and also we see the benefits of the new products that we're launching. So we're very excited about the future. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions. Louise Mehrotra : You're welcome. Next question please. Operator : Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Jami. Jami Rubin : Good morning. Couple of questions for you Dominic, just back on the REMICADE biosimilar potential, can you just update us on what's happening with the patent, because the last we saw the U.S. PTO issued a rejection on your September 2018 composition of matter patent and just if you could remind us what the appeals process looks like, could Celltrion launch at risk since you lost the patent, the composition of matter. How does that work? And then, one probably, do you have long-dated patents around REMICADE that you can assert using the 351(k) pathway. And then my second question relates to utilization. I think in the last quarter or two you talk about two straight quarters of improved U.S. utilization. Are you seeing that continue into the first quarter? And then last question, and apologies for the nitpickiness of this, but I'm just trying to understand my math. You had talked about an additional $500 million in one-time gains from sales. That to me looks like $0.14 but you talked about $0.10 combined with -- which was a combination of the one-time gain plus operational benefits, so, just curious what I'm missing. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Okay, okay Jami. Thanks for the questions. So let me start with\u2026 Jami Rubin : I'm sorry, they are too many but I had to get them all-in. Dominic Caruso : That's okay. You got them all in. I'll try my best to answer them all. And we'll take them in the same order. So the REMICADE Biosimilar patent situation is what you asked about. So let me just give a perspective on that. Yes, it's true that the U.S. Patent Office has issued what is referred to as a final rejection. But under the process in the U.S. Patent Office, the word final is not exactly what Layman or I would consider as final. So there are number of steps that can still occur after that final rejection and in fact one of those steps includes our response to that final rejection which we filed just yesterday. Then that filing then is reviewed by the Patent Office and we would expect to hear back from them in the next 30 to 60 days and depending on that response we then have another avenue of appeal which if the current position of the Patent Offices remains the same we have another appeal process which could take another 12 months or so to prosecute with the Patent Office and then after that even if there is an adverse ruling after that there's another decision to the Court of Appeals in the federal circuit court that we could appeal for which would take another 12 to 18 months. So first of all, as I said earlier, we're very confident in the strength of our patents and we intent to pursue all the available avenues for appeal and we're doing so including our response just yesterday to what was previously described by you as the final. But it's not final as I've just described. On whether Celltrion will launch at risk it\u2019s a question for them. I really can't comment what they might do. And then in terms of utilization we have seen an uptake in utilization in this first quarter, a continued trend, although slight increases but nonetheless positive increases in overall hospital admissions, surgical procedures, doctor visits, et cetera, so that's encouraging. We continue to see now trends of now three consecutive quarters of positive trends in healthcare utilization. And then finally, on your math, as you were trying to do and let me try to help everyone that, because I think it would be a common question. So we talked about increase in other income and expense, because of the tax rates applied to those particular items in that line item, let's call that roughly about $0.12 of earnings and minus \u2013 sorry, let's call that $0.12 on earnings on a pretax basis, the tax rate going up is primarily due to the fact that those items have a higher U.S. tax burden, so our tax rate went up as a results let's call that $0.07 negative. So now you're up $0.05. And we said, we increased our operational earnings by $0.10, so that $0.05 I just described and another $0.05 just as a continued good management and overall progress we're making in the business overall for the $0.10 that I've just described earlier, so hopefully that's helpful. Jami Rubin : Yes. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning, guys. Wanted to start with a question on spine, Louise, in your prepared remarks you talked about, I believe it was in the U.S., competition and pricing challenge for the negative U.S. spine number in the quarter. Can you talk to us about what the challenges you're facing? Is it from the smaller players taking share? And can you describe to us the pricing pressure, and how that compared to the fourth quarter? And then I had a follow-up on robotics. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. So going forward because we have some movement between price and mix when a new products goes up, annualizes itself, I'm going to start giving people only price and mix on the U.S. price changes, okay. So, in the first quarter we had a 5% decline price and mix in the U.S. in spine and that compared to about 4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. And regarding the competitive there is new products coming out with our competition and as Dominic mentioned we have a number of new products coming from ourselves as well. So it's just more of timing and we expect it to pickup throughout the year. Glenn Novarro : And just as a follow-up, the pricing little worse for you guys here in the first quarter, do you have any commentary why that may have happened, does it just more about your mix and your new product cadence? Louise Mehrotra : Its lot to do with the mix, Glenn, yes. Dominic Caruso : I think generally Glenn, price has been negative in this marketplace in orthopedics now for several quarters and we're just seeing that trend continue. We just saw it recently as well. Glenn Novarro : Okay, and just on the competition side, like I said. You can look at two-thirds of the market, and it's you and Medtronic. So is the pressure really coming from that other third, some of the younger upstart companies? Louise Mehrotra : I'm just going to take a look at the share data and then I will \u2013 if you have another question, go ahead and ask that and I'll just take a look at the share and see where it's going then. Glenn Novarro : And then, I just wanted to follow-up on your robotics commentary. So, you recently announced collaboration with Google. Can you talk about the timing of when you may have a robot that could enter the market? Is this two or three years out, longer or shorter? Any commentary on the time frame would be helpful? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Sure, Glenn. Well, so one thing I would say, this is a continuation of what we discussed at the MD&D business review day a year ago. So we had mentioned that we were working on our own robotics program internally. We've now obviously partnered with Google to gain their expertise in technology and visualization and in robotics and I think that's going to provide us some acceleration to the plans we were already anticipating. We're already in the market for robotics in terms of our particular \u2013 in terms of particular procedures where our Ethicon products are used at the end of the robot, at the actually procedure end of the robot. So we'll continue to do that. We would expect this collaboration would take \u2013 I would say several years for us to come to the market with the new type of robotic surgery that we think we'll dramatically revolutionize surgery. So, I think it will take some time to do that, but we're accelerating our efforts there and I'd say it\u2019s a couple of years away. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Glenn, I just checked, it is the smaller players that appeared to be taking share. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Louise Mehrotra : Next question, please. Glenn Novarro : Thanks, Dominic. Dominic Caruso : You're welcome. Operator : You're next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, David. David Lewis : Hi, good morning. Just Dominic, one quick nit for you, and then a couple pharmaceutical questions as well, just as we see a step up in gross margins, Dominic, in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, we didn't see that in this particular quarter. Was anything driving that in particular? Dominic Caruso : Yes, David, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the main issue with gross margin this quarter versus last year and also versus the fourth quarter I should have said, that has to do with currency impact. So it's just \u2013 even though we hedge most of our manufacturing foreign currency commitments; they do roll over from year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter so this particular quarter I could sort of reflect on it and say it\u2019s essentially all currency impacts. David Lewis : Okay. It\u2019s very helpful and then two quick questions on pharma. The first is on REMICADE outside the U.S. there was a little bit of softness. It wasn\u2019t clear from prepared remarks whether that reflected inventory issues or some stocking element or increasing competition. And then secondarily and INVOKANA a very strong number the two elements I wanted to get your views on. The first is, it does appear in some of the data INVOKANA is beginning to accelerate its year related to certain specific competitors. And the second question was just given these increasing concerns on DPV IV [ph] drug class, could we see a positive class effect? Are you expecting one for the SGL2s? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Yes well with REMICADE OUS as Louise mentioned we saw these are shipments that we make to our partner Merck for their territories outside the U.S. and as you know many of those territories we have seen the loss of exclusivity so biosimilars have entered those markets. So the primary reason is basically lower shipments to our partner as they plan for the balance of the year, anything else you could add to that Louise. Louise Mehrotra : Yeah so if you will recall about a year ago we made some changes to our supply chain which caused the some of the export sales that we recorded in the U.S. we actually recorded in the international. So you really have to add those two together to get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on there. If you take a look at them together it\u2019s down about 2%. We had very strong sales in Canada and then that was offset by some the distributor sales being down due to the weakening of the euro and also market pressures because of the biosimilars and they did have an inventory build with our distributors. So there\u2019s a number of compounding factors that are going on there. So you really need to take a look at it in total. Dominic Caruso : And then with INVOKANA we are very pleased obviously with the performance of INVOKANA and with INVOKAMET in particular because as you know you know many patients take these SGLT2s in combination with Metformin so that product is doing well. Whether or not this is a class effect for SGLT2 I think we have a particular benefit and strong SGLT2 and the benefit that we have here is of course the lower HbA1c levels, lower weight gain etcetera so the product is getting very very good acceptance and it\u2019s now you know exceeding all the other SGLT2 that have recently come to the market by significant margins and gaining market share despite increased competition. Louise Mehrotra : And so our commercial payers we have about 75% coverage at Tier 2 and the Part D we have about 85% coverage added here to which is the lowest tier for our brand. And so we are doing very very well in the reimbursement front and we are gaining share in all the categories. You know the end work share sequentially, it\u2019s a 11.8 in the first quarter and that\u2019s up from 10.3, so nice growth there and even more impressive is the primary care going from 3.6 to 4.3 and primary care is about 60% of that market, so it\u2019s really impressive results. David Lewis : Great. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra : You\u2019re welcome. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Rick. Rick Wise : Good morning, Dominic and Louise how are you doing? Let me start off Dominic with surgical care and speciality surgeries specifically you know both business has been pretty flat for a few quarter here. It\u2019s not surprising in median surgical care but speciality surgery, can you \u2013 you were saying volumes are picking up and that we have not seen it yet. Is this lagging or it\u2019s been accelerated competitive issues, just give us some more color if you could. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : So within the speciality surgery area we have a number of businesses put in there. So if you but you could take a look at the core businesses of biologics and energy, biologics is up 7% worldwide, energy is up 4% worldwide and if you look at the OUS for biologics its up 11% and OUS is up 5%. So a clearance in there which is causing some depression of the numbers, Mentor is in there as well what Mentor is doing well. So but if you really take a look at the two cores, they are doing very well. Dominic Caruso : Yeah, I think that\u2019s well said Louise. Biosurgicals in particular is doing very very well and Energy is with the launch of new products is gaining momentum. I think we\u2019ll see it in future quarters quite frankly as these products have just recently launched, but there is some noise in the other segments, but the overall core business is doing very well Rick. Rick Wise : Okay. And turning to diabetes you highlighted that ANIMAS have strong double digit growth is this all VIBE and moving past the negative price cuts and just and may be talk \u2013 give a little more color again on VIBE the roll out where you are and you have highlighted the 3-Day Wearable Patch as a possibility, where does that stand? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well Rick it is primarily due to the VIBE business. So VIBE was launched OUS last year and continue to pick up a lot of volume, did extremely well OUS and was just launched in the U.S. recently and we\u2019re seeing some very very good uptick on VIBE and we\u2019re very very pleased by that new insulin pump it\u2019s doing very very well taking share and growing and with the with what we saw happening OUS certainly bodes well for the uptick of that product in the U.S. In terms of the Wearable Patch Pump that\u2019s probably a couple of years out still, obviously we need to scale up manufacturing complete some additional work on that. A few of us were just there recently visiting our diabetes business and all plans are in shape there, they are moving forward with all the manufacturing that needs to be done, so we are very excited that will come in the market but it\u2019s probably you know by \u2013 but not before 2016 I would say. Rick Wise : Okay, just a quick follow up on the VIBE. Are you getting to taking you are sure are you converting your existing customers or is it taking competitive share? Dominic Caruso : Yes from what we saw the data we saw shows us that we are taking competitive share you know from the major player in the marketplace. Louise Mehrotra : Yes with the very strong growth rates we had we would have to be taking share. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jenning with Cowen & Company. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Josh. Josh Jenning : Good morning, thanks so much for taking the question. Just wanted to start Dominic if you would just on the strategy behind the quarters divestiture it seemed like it was an underperforming unit, but just you know throughout last year some of your commentary now it\u2019s a commentary seem that you were looking to get bigger in cardiology not smaller. Can you give us just a little more color on that acquisition and also just your outlook for the cardiology spaces and your comfort level of having a relatively standalone BioSense Webster division? Dominic Caruso : Yes, well it\u2019s a great question, Josh. We\u2019ve been very consistent with our approach to divestitures and Alex has many times if we are not neither number one or number two in the market or we don\u2019t see a pathway of being number one, number two in the markets through technology and the appropriate amount of investment or for example if its not otherwise complementary to our business and it should be a candidate for divestiture. So as you pointed out we obviously did not divest the BioSense Webster piece of the Cordis business, that\u2019s very very promising. Business is doing extremely well; new innovations come in the market etcetera. So we are pleased with being in the cardiovascular device space where innovation is rewarded and whether significant unmet need that we can actually address the main reason for exiting the Cordis business is it generally has become from our vantage point the commodity business and it will be in our view better managed in the hands of others and I think Cardinal is going to do just a great job with that business. Josh Jenning : Thanks for that and then just the follow up on operating margins in the quarter. You know only 50 basis point ahead year-over-year despite release your headwind and affects. Can you help us think about sort of apples-to-apples ex-HCV [ph] in terms of the operating margin performance and then how we should think about operating margins year-over-year 2015 over 2014? Thanks a lot. Dominic Caruso : Yes well the first quarter there was some impact for OLYSIO but obviously OLYSIO grew throughout 2014 so we\u2019ll see that operating margin decline more pronounced in future quarters obviously and that\u2019s all in our guidance. The guidance we provided shows that if I mean we didn\u2019t give you a specific operating margin but you walk through the P&L as you update your models you\u2019ll see that the pre tax operating profit margin is probably going to go down about 150 basis points and that\u2019s primarily 120 basis points due to the OLYSIO net OLYSIO because remember we invested some of those gains last year. And that of course is what I referred to earlier that were offsetting with the decisions that we\u2019ve made about the portfolio we think these are the right decisions to make at the right time, they also come at a time when we can offset this decline in operating profit margin. Hopefully that\u2019s clear now Josh. Josh Jenning : Thanks so much. Dominic Caruso : Yes. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : And we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Jason. Jayson Bedford : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions, just a couple of quick ones. On consumer, in terms of the consent decree, third party has blessed the facilities. You're now waiting for the FDA. When it's officially lifted, can you give us an idea as to the potential impact on the business if any and specifically as it relates to margins which still look like the down in the low double digit? Dominic Caruso : Sure, Jason well it is true that we\u2019ve completed our work and we have outside party that sort of verifies what we completed and prepares their report and then the FDA has to come in and certify. But even after the FDA certifies remember that we still will operate under the consent decree for a 5-year period, that\u2019s what the law requires. Now during that 5-year period we\u2019ll continue to make improvements etcetera but and I would say generally speaking the consumer business has done a very nice job mapping out the fact that gross margins and overall margins in that business should improve overtime while at the same time we\u2019re investing behind the products that we are launching. So I would say we\u2019ll see continued improvements in margins, I wouldn\u2019t view them as dramatic in the short term but continued steady progress and improvements in that business which we are very pleased with. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you very much. So some final comments from Dominic. Dominic Caruso : Okay, thanks everyone, and thanks, Louise. So as I noted earlier we are very pleased with our strong start to 2015 and I would just like to take a moment and recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson and thank you all for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. And finally just a reminder, that we will be conducting a review for the investment community of our pharmaceutical business on May 20th in New Brunswick and I obviously look forward to seeing you all there. So have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Sandi Peterson, Group Worldwide Chairman, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I will begin by briefly reviewing second quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Alex will provide additional commentary on the business and our progress with regards to our near-term priorities. Next, Sandi will provide an update on our consumer and consumer medical device businesses. Lastly, Dominic will review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Now, I would like to review results for the second quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the second quarter of 2015, down 8.8% versus second quarter 2014. On an operational basis, sales were down 0.9% and currency had a negative impact of 7.9%. In the U.S., sales were down 2.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.5%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 14.8%. On an operational basis, the Asia Pacific Africa region grew by 2.2%, while Europe grew 1% and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 4%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 1.7% worldwide, 0.6% in the U.S., and 2.7% outside the U.S. Additionally, excluding hepatitis C sales underlying operational growth was 5%. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.5 billion and earnings per share were $1.61 versus $1.51 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and a charge of $66 million for after-tax special items. 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $807 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.71, representing decreases of 6.3% and 3.9% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6.7%. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.5 billion increased 2.3%, with U.S. sales up 2.7%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 2.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 3.1% worldwide, 2.9% in the U.S., and 3.2% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S. and Oral Care. OTC sales growth was driven by worldwide analgesics, ZYRTEC in the U.S. and other upper respiratory products outside the U.S. Upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC sales, included a seasonal inventory build. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 44%, up from 39% a year ago. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 1% with U.S. sales down 1.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.8%. New competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 9.7%, 16.5% and 2.5% respectively. U.S. results included a positive adjustment to sales reserves for managed Medicaid rebates reflecting final data received. U.S. comparisons to second quarter 2014 were positively impacted by approximately 2% and worldwide by approximately 1%. The most significant impact from the managed Medicaid adjustment was through hormonal contraceptives. Significant contributors to growth were INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION, CONCERTA and immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI. Strong momentum in market share increases drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 5.9% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 13.2% for the quarter and 5.2% in primary care, up 1.2% and 0.8% respectively on a sequential basis. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET remains the category leader in new to brand share with endocrinologists and has greater than 80% preferred access across commercial and Part D plans. Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in the second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake, particularly in Germany, France, and the UK. XARELTO sales were up nearly 31% and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to 15.4%, up over 2 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care reached 12.4% and in cardiology, 23.7%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market, at nearly 12.5%, drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 28.6% of that market, down approximately 1.7 points on a sequential basis due to increased competition. As an update, during the quarter, we received several Paragraph IV notifications from generic manufacturers advising that they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA in the U.S. before the expiration of the relevant patents listed in the orange book. The composition of matter patent is owned by our partner, BTG, and expires in December 2016 and the method of treatment patent is owned by Janssen Oncology Inc. and expires in August 2027. We are currently evaluating the notices. Outside the U.S., ZYTIGA achieved very strong growth in Asia and Latin America, which was partly offset by lower sales in Europe due to increased competition. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results due primarily to increased market share while CONCERTA growth was primarily due to therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors. The results for immunology were driven by strong double digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE sales to our distributors reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe as well as the reduction in inventory levels. I will now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 5.8% while sales outside the U.S. declined 3.9%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 1.4% worldwide with the U.S. up 1.6% and growth of 1.4% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Specialty Surgery, Cardiovascular Care and Orthopaedics. Specialty Surgery growth was driven by bio-surgery growth of over 8% and energy growth of approximately 6% due to market growth, share gains in certain segments and new product introductions. Cardiovascular growth was driven by 10% worldwide increase in electrophysiology due to strong sales of ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by knees and hips as well as ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in sports medicine. The growth was partially offset by lower sales in trauma and spine due to pricing pressure coupled with the timing of tender business and competitive challenges in spine. Knees worldwide increased 4% with the U.S. up 5% and sales outside the U.S. up 2%, driven by strong sales of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure. Hips growth of 2% worldwide was driven by 4% growth in the U.S. with strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Outside the U.S., sales were flat with strong growth in China and India, offset by lower sales in the Middle East due to the timing of tender business. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the second quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist you as you develop your models. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s second quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone. I really appreciate you taking the time to join our call today. And since we are at the midpoint of the year, I am excited to share the progress we have made against our near-term priorities. I will also use the time today to give some perspective on the environment that we are operating in and some of the macro level issues we are seeing and also discuss why we believe with our innovation model and breadth and scale of our business, the Johnson & Johnson is strongly positioned to drive continued growth and shareholder value. So I will start the discussion though where I always do with Our Credo. Our Credo serves as the moral compass for our company and expresses a set of values that bond our associates worldwide with a shared commitment to meet and really exceed the expectations of the more than 1 billion people a day that rely on our products as well as to support our fellow colleagues, the communities in which we live and work and generate solid return to our shareholders. Now back in January, I laid out our near-term priorities for the business and I am pleased with our progress towards them. Across the enterprise, we are very focused on delivering our financial and quality commitments. First, our commitment to ensuring our products meet the highest quality standards is of course non-negotiable. And as to our financial commitments thus far in the year, we generated sales of $35.2 billion, reflecting the strong underlying operational growth across the enterprise of about 6% when we adjust for the impact of Hepatitis C sales and acquisitions and divestitures. And for the first six months, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.27. On an operational basis, we delivered adjusted EPS of $3.59 growing at 5.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we knew there are year-over-year comparisons to our current results would be challenging because of the tremendous contributions of OLYSIO last year as well as the impact of divestitures we made and also the significant devaluation of major foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Now despite these headwinds our broad base of innovative offerings, scale and global footprint are driving our strong core performance. In pharmaceuticals, we reported sales of $15.7 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth when excluding the impact of Hepatitis C and divestitures of over 11% for the first half of 2015, led by our new and core products including INVOKANA, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO and STELARA and ZYTIGA. Our focused R&D strategy and commitment to driving launch excellence to ensure broad access and reimbursement has really come together to make a difference for patients and have this well-positioned to continue to drive above industry compound annual growth rate over the next several years. Fueled by seven of our recently launched products that we expect will each exceed $1 billion in sales this year and the more than 10 new products we plan to file by 2019 that each have $1 billion plus potential of their own based on their transformational potential to treat significant unmet medical needs worldwide. And just last week, our partner Genmab announced that we have completed the FDA submission for daratumumab, a promising new breakthrough treatment option for people with multiple myeloma. This organization has collectively done great work to generate strong clinical evidence in the development process, which is enabling our reimbursement teams to gain the right coverage levels in order to create broad access and drive the strong performance of our products despite the pricing pressure that exist in the marketplace. Now I also want to make a comment here on our position regarding biosimilar competition for REMICADE, which I know many of you are thinking about. Remember, biosimilars are not generics and we expect the biosimilar market to behave quite differently than the market typically has toward the introduction of a generic. Also more than 2.2 million people have been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients are receiving sustained and effective treatment so we believe their doctors are very unlikely to switch them off with that level of success. And we also have a patent for the REMICADE antibody that doesn\u2019t expire until September 2018 that you can be sure we will continue to vigorously defend. Look, we know competition in the immunology space is fierce and to ensure we maintain the leadership position, we built an established portfolio of $1 billion plus medicines that include STELARA and SIMPONI and have potential $1 billion plus products in our late stage development like sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis and guselkumab for psoriasis that we expect to introduce in the near-term. And we are also making very significant investments in disruptive research areas like the microbiome, which holds the potential to intercept the disease and prevent it entirely that will have applications in immunology and really across all our disease areas. Now turning to Medical Devices, you know we are number one or number two in the majority of the categories in which we compete and have ten $1 billion plus platforms. Year-to-date, we reported global medical device sales of $12.6 billion, which is an operational decline of 4.6% due to the impact of the sale of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, which we completed a year ago. When we adjust for that, our underlying operational growth in medical devices is up 1.4%. I have been particularly pleased with the performance in several areas of this business where new innovations are driving growth, including our Biosense Webster business, which has grown nearly 11% operationally for the first six months of the year. Our Endocutter business has grown 15.5% and our Biosurgery business with continued strong growth of 7.5%. In diabetes, our products and strong in-market execution are helping to revitalize that business while our Vision Care business is on track to return to growth later in the year when we will anniversary the impact of the 2014 price reset. In Orthopaedics, the business grew 1.5% operationally this year with good growth in the reconstruction and sports medicine segment. Particularly in the second quarter here in the U.S. where despite the pricing dynamics in the market, we saw over 5% growth in knees and approximately 4% in hips. Our spine and trauma businesses however, have lagged market growth today and we are absolutely committed to turning them around. And we have new products launching this year that will help us do just that. Now as we look at this market, the ongoing consolidation among health systems and within the insurance industry is continuing to create pressure on pricing. We have been encouraged though by data showing that healthcare utilization trends in the U.S. have continued to improve for the fourth consecutive quarter with growth in both hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures. And we remain optimistic about increased global healthcare utilization as well. So, we are absolutely committed to accelerating our growth in medical devices through innovation and through our research and development, which has been productive as the teams have already submitted more than half of the 30 major filings we previously announced we plan to file by the end of 2016. And the work we are doing with Google illustrates how we are aiming to pioneer the operating room of the future with robotic surgery tools that will increase the surgeon\u2019s precision and minimize trauma for their patients, while also reducing cost for the systems. We are also transforming our go-to-market models to fully leverage the breadth and scale of our capabilities, but we have taken significant measures to strengthen our core businesses and effectively position ourselves to lead over the long-term. We just recently integrated our Global Orthopaedics and Global Surgery businesses under the leadership of Gary Pruden, which will enable us to have a much more holistic approach to the way we do business. And the goal here is very straightforward. Let\u2019s enhance our partnerships with the hospital systems and identify ways to improve outcomes by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio. We already have numerous examples of co-promotions, broad contracting agreements and service and solution offerings in place that we can look to expand and by better working in this new alignment model, we will be better positioned to great more of them to drive future growth. Gary will be on the third quarter call in October to tell you more about this approach. And now in the Consumer business, Sandi Peterson and her team, which includes our new Worldwide Chairman for the consumer companies, Jorge Mesquita, a seasoned leader who has been with us since the end of last year, are doing tremendous work in building and executing a strategy that has effectively addressed the past challenges in our supply chain and reprioritized our approach in the category. And we are positioned to expand our market leadership in key segments moving forward. Year-to-date, we generated $6.9 billion in sales and reported operational growth of nearly 4%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, driven by our market leading OTC and Oral Care businesses. And our strategy to focus the portfolio around the key consumer need states in brands that are backed with strong clinical science and professional endorsements is having a strong impact. The United States OTC medicines are sharply up 13% for the year led by the strong campaigns who are leading in support and the re-launch of key brands like TYLENOL, MOTRIN and ZYRTEC. And our momentum here could not have been achieved without the efforts of our colleagues to complete the complex work required around the consent decree. Globally, we see strong operational growth in emerging markets, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia and Venezuela. We are however experiencing market pressures in China, where our volumes have slowed due to lower demand that is being compounded by shifts in consumer behaviors and the emergence of new retail channels in the country. In a few minutes, Sandi will take you through the strategy and approach for how our consumer-facing businesses are leveraging our unique consumer insights and integrating science and different forms of technology to better meet the needs of consumers and drive growth. But before we do that, I want to reiterate how we are navigating the environmental changes before us and how we strongly positioned Johnson & Johnson to deliver continued growth. As you well know, everything starts with innovation. And at Johnson & Johnson, we are doing that on multiple fronts and we are committed to working with researchers around the world to ensure we continue to operate the leading edge of science, medicine and technology. And that approach drives our enterprise R&D and the significant investments we are making to benefit patients and stakeholders. We have a good balance of internal and externally sourced innovations and acquisitions have accounted for just under half of our sales growth over the last decade and we are always actively looking for new value-creating acquisitions and deals to continue that success. We also invested about 11.5% of our net trade sales or $8.5 billion in R&D last year across the enterprise to discover in-license and develop innovative new products, and you can see the impact reflected in our portfolio and robust development pipeline, which includes 25 active late-stage development programs, 160-plus early-stage programs in over 70 venture investments. And in just two years, there is already 90 start-ups working in our J-Labs, which creates tremendous access to new ideas and potential downstream partnerships for the future. Now, when it comes to making significant R&D investments, we must also focus on managing through the inherent complexities in the global regulatory environment in order to ensure our products are ultimately able to reach consumers. We are encouraged by the steps governments are taking to increase access to quality healthcare for their people and to also create and support a more innovation-friendly environment through designations and speed to review and approval of transformational products. We benefited from that with IMBRUVICA, and today, we have two other candidates in our pharma pipeline already designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA. At the same time, we can all agree that governments around the world must do more to protect intellectual property and ensure fair, transparent and consistent enforcement of regulations governing the trade of innovative products and we will continue to watch and engage in these issues into more than 65 countries in which we do business. Globally, about half our total year-to-date sales come from countries outside the United States with strong national and regional models like those we have installed in China and Southeast Asia, we are better able to maximize the breadth of our portfolio, interact more effectively with governments and develop contracting strategies and gain consumer insights that are shaping our international portfolios and informing R&D and ultimately driving growth. And by executing with excellence in all that we do, we have introduced a strong cadence of new product launches over the past five years that today account for about 25% of our overall sales and we are taking steps to ensure we are even more effective and efficient across the enterprise by investing in greater uses of technology and streamlining our back office processes, which we expect will help to free up about $1 billion that we can invest back into the business by 2018. We are also continuing to make strategic decisions about the areas we are going to participate in or move on from. As we stated before, our focus is on areas where we are or we can be number one or number two in a particular area as well as on those products or businesses that will be directly complementary. And if we have an asset or a business that doesn\u2019t meet those criteria, we have demonstrated that we will divest it and redirect our resources to accelerate existing programs or to acquire new ones that we think are ultimately going to help more patients and also add more value to our enterprise. We also see that our broad base across the healthcare spectrum is a competitive advantage when the strategies we create consider and where appropriate incorporate insights and innovations from every aspect of our operations to attack disease and improve health outcomes. The work we are doing with IBM and Apple does this by cutting across the enterprise and leveraging our science, technology and consumer insights to empower patients and caregivers to help speed the post-surgical recovery process. Executing our strategy ultimately comes down to people and by focusing on them and emphasizing our Credo-based purpose, we developed a deep bench of extraordinary talent, we are accountable for driving their businesses and we will also ensure we are taking leading roles within the industry and world medical community to combat global public health issues like Ebola and HIV. Now, just to summarize, Johnson & Johnson is a company that\u2019s built a remarkable legacy and has a very exciting future. Healthcare though remains one of every society\u2019s greatest challenges and nothing affects people more personally or affects communities and nations more directly. Our business is strong and you can see that we are continuing to make considerable investments in innovation and have a robust pipeline of truly transformative products to ultimately benefit patients and that we are taking actions to strengthen our leadership positions in areas in which we compete. With our transparent and consistent capital allocation strategy, we extended our track record of dividend increases to 53 consecutive years in April when we declared a 7.1% increase, taking our quarterly payout up to $0.75 per share and have returned about 70% of our free cash flow over the past decade to investors outpacing the S&P 500 in 2014 as well as over the last 3, 10 and 20 years. With that, it\u2019s now my distinct pleasure to turn the call over to Sandi Peterson. Sandi joined Johnson & Johnson just over 2.5 years ago and is leading a significant transformation across major components of our enterprise, including our consumer-facing businesses, enterprise supply chain, quality and IT and she has been a tremendous leader here since day 1. I want to thank her and her team for what they have already accomplished for our business and more importantly for what they will continue to do to help patients and consumers worldwide. With that, I am pleased to turn the meeting now over to Sandi and we will rejoin you a bit later to take your questions. Sandi Peterson : Good morning. I am happy to have the opportunity to talk about our progress in our consumer-facing businesses, consumer diabetes solutions and vision care. I will also discuss the evolution in our approach to technology across the enterprise. Increasingly, as we lead through the disruptions and opportunities in global healthcare, we are fusing the power of technology with the power of science to deliver improved outcomes for patients, consumers and customers. First, our three consumer-facing businesses, as Alex said earlier, the future of these businesses looks promising. While they are at different stages of transformation, we believe that they are all well-positioned in attractive, growing global markets, and we are driving scale and growth in each. Let me start with consumer. Our iconic consumer brands are J&J\u2019s face to the world. They are how we are known by millions around the globe. They are a first point of entry into emerging markets, so they really are very important to the overall enterprise. They are and will increasingly be important contributors to J&J\u2019s financial performance. Demographic trends and changes in the way consumers make healthcare decisions are creating new opportunities for our consumer business. Our consumer expertise and insight are highly valuable to payers and providers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We view a healthy consumer business as a growth annuity for J&J with less volatility than other markets. As many of you know, we launched our new consumer strategy in 2013. We focused on stabilizing and revitalizing the business, re-mediating quality issues in U.S. OTC and being clear about where and how to compete and win around the world. We are executing successfully against that strategy. We are pleased to say that we have re-mediated and re-launched our U.S. OTC business. Over 80% of our brands have returned to the market. TYLENOL Arthritis will launch soon. We have made significant progress in meeting consent decree requirements. The FDA has certified our manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We recently had a successful FDA inspection in Fort Washington and are awaiting final notification. Our OTC brands continue to be loved by consumers and we have regained the trust of our customers. Most of our OTC products are endorsed as number one in their categories by healthcare professionals. TYLENOL remains the number one doctor recommended brand for pain relief and the brand most used by hospitals. ZYRTEC, Children\u2019s TYLENOL and Children\u2019s MOTRIN are also number one recommended brands. Last year, our OTC portfolio grew four times the category in the U.S. That strength has continued this year with 13% growth in the first half and 16% in the latest quarter. More broadly, across the consumer business, we have made significant progress in creating a world class brand building and marketing organization. We have globalized the management of 12 mega brands and are focused on 11 consumer need states. We have expanded these brands into new markets and are seeing strong share gains in Oral Care, Beauty and OTC. We are growing 11% year-to-date and gaining share in feminine protection, for example, in places like India, Germany, South Africa and Poland. And we have revitalized our iconic BAND-AID Brand. In the U.S., Band-Aid consumption grew 6.3% and we gained 2 share points. Thanks to decorated BAND-AID and commercial innovation. As we invest in our global brands and our top regional brands and in our priority markets, we are building new marketing capabilities such as digital. We doubled our digital media investments and digital channels with emphasis on social and mobile. Today, 40% of our digital ad spending is via mobile and more than 90% of our Facebook ads are served up on either smartphones or tablets. This global centralized marketing approach is bringing our beloved brands to their full potential. You may have seen the results of the new model, Come to Life in the Johnson\u2019s Baby So Much More campaign, the first global campaign for our iconic baby equity. The campaign launched in 7 lead markets in February and is rolled out to more than 20 markets. By the third quarter of this year, all major markets will launch. Early results show sequential consumption growth and share improvement. In the U.S. alone, through May, Johnson\u2019s has grown 2.4 share points since the launch. Our product pipeline in consumer is also quite robust. We are focused on developing science-based, clinically validated products grounded in deep consumer insights and most importantly endorsed by professionals. We have 20 key product launches this year, for example, NEUTROGENA Hydro Boost, MOTRIN Liquid Gels and the launch of the new LISTERINE whitening formula in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Improving our supply chain has also been another critical focus in the consumer business with a strong emphasis on the U.S. OTC consent decree. Across the enterprise, we have made remarkable progress in transforming our supply chain to ensure we deliver quality, customer reliability and benchmark profitability. We continue to see the benefits of reintegrating our supply chain organization to drive performance improvements in every J&J segment. As we look ahead in consumer, we will continue to rebuild our competitive edge. The underlying environmental drivers, demographics, the developing middle-class in emerging markets and lifestyle shifts suggest growing consumer need for our products and increased opportunity to help more people live healthier, more vibrant lives. Across the business, we are focused on delivering above-market growth and benchmark profitability. Consumer IBT margin before special items and intangible amortization expense has increased from 14.1% in 2013 to 15.4% in 2014 and we will continue to improve profitability until we achieve benchmark levels. Our organic sales, adjusted for currency and excluding acquisitions and divestitures, grew approximately 4% in the first half. Since mid 2013, we have grown organic sales steadily. Last year, we grew share for the first time in a number of years and we are committed to continuing that trend. We manage our consumer brand portfolio actively with an eye towards targeted expansion in key geographies and need states through focused acquisitions and licensing agreements. A recent example includes the acquisition in India of ORSL. The intersection of changes in the healthcare landscape, disruptions in the retail environment and changes in consumer expectations and behaviors creates an opportunity J&J\u2019s consumer business is well-suited to capitalize on. Now, let me turn to our Diabetes Solutions business. Diabetes is the fourth largest healthcare category in the world. Globally, the therapies and devices market is growing at 5%. 50% of patients with diabetes are, unfortunately, undiagnosed or not controlled, which creates an opportunity for us to grow and an important opportunity to impact patient\u2019s lives. Given the power of our OneTouch brand, a highly innovative pipeline, strong commercial execution and operational efficiency, we are well-positioned to deliver profitable growth in diabetes despite negative industry pricing dynamics. In blood glucose monitoring, we hold the number one value and volume position in our 9 top markets. This year\u2019s OneTouch Verio platform launch is our most successful launch in the last two decades. In the U.S. alone, volume share grew 3 points. We have strong penetration in emerging markets, where type 2 diabetes is growing and we have simplified our portfolio dramatically, reducing the number of strip platforms from 5 to 2 and module mere offerings from 14 to 3. We have reduced our facility footprint, slashed the number of SKUs by more than 55% and taken significant cost out of the business. In insulin delivery, we are growing at market-leading rates, up operationally 32% year-to-date worldwide, driven by Animas Vibe. In 2015, we took over the number two share position. In addition, we are making excellent progress in preparing for the launch of Calibra, a new product which will create an entirely new category. Calibra is a wearable, disposable insulin delivery patch that meets type 2 patients\u2019 needs for discretion, convenience and control. We are beginning the clinical outcome study and anticipate entering the market next year. Looking forward, we are developing insight-driven, market-appropriate innovations across the BGM and insulin delivery platforms in areas such as digital solutions, continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery. We will continue to leverage enterprise capabilities and expand targeted strategic partnerships. Great examples of this include our collaboration with Nova Biomedical and Hospital Systems and Dexcom with continuous glucose monitoring pumps. We are particularly enthusiastic about the potential to improve engagement and health outcomes with digital solutions that motivate patients to better self manage while creating value for healthcare providers and healthcare systems. Now, let me turn to Vision Care. Eye health remains one of the largest, fastest growing and most underserved segments in healthcare. Vision correction represents more than half of that market with contact lenses representing a $7 billion segment, the presbyopia and astigmatism markets are especially underserved. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Vision Care has a long history as the global market leader in contact lenses. Our success was built on category leading innovation, strong relationships with the eye care professional and the most recognized brand equity in the category. It\u2019s no secret, however that we faced capacity and portfolio issues in Vision Care in 2012 and 2013. At the same time, competition intensified and consumer preferences shifted. The market structure has evolved in response, driving increased emphasis on e-commerce and increased price competition between channels. These developments have reduced engagement for eye care professionals, who are an important ingredient in strong category health. Despite this, we continued to lead the category globally by 11 points. We continue to grow at double-digits in our lead emerging markets. BRIC market operational sales are up double digits, driven by continued strong performance of Russia, Brazil and China. Last year, we instituted a one-time price reset to bring more value to consumers in close partnership with eye care professionals in the trade in the U.S. and Japan. We will anniversary this event in Q3, as Alex said earlier and should see revenue momentum in the second half. Share has stabilized in the U.S. for five consecutive months. We are outperforming the market in volume in our top two strategic brands, ACUVUE OASYS and 1-Day ACUVUE MOIST and our equity measures with eye care professionals have improved. In Q2 alone, we grew 15% operationally in Japan, driven by strong performance of our leading 1-DAY ACUVUE TruEye and the recent launch of 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE as well as favorable comps. Our R&D strategy leverages consumer expertise and science based, clinically supported manufacturing enabled innovation and we have built a robust multi-generational pipeline. We are launching our first major innovations in 5 years, with 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE, 1-Day ACUVUE Multifocal and ACUVUE OASYS overnight. You will see us accelerate innovation in high growth specialty segments such as beauty, presbyopia and astigmatism. We will sustain innovation in our largest core platforms spherical reusable and sphere daily disposable. We anticipate at least one major product launch in each of the next 3 years, including innovations with the potential to disrupt the category. Vision Care used the new marketing process developed in consumer to re-launch the iconic ACUVUE brand. The new global ACUVUE campaign which went live last week is designed to drive consumer engagement and category growth and ensure the differentiated position with eye care professionals. Our world class supply chain is a competitive advantage in Vision Care. Our manufacturing team produced approximately 4 billion lenses in 2014. We are continuing to invest in capacity expansion while operating with 99.6% customer service levels. Though we are still in the throes of rejuvenating our eye care business, we have made considerable progress, which will continue this year and into the next. As we bring our core contact lens business back to market leading growth, we will also pursue our aspirations in the broader eye health market. Alex started this morning by talking about the power of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s broad base in healthcare. Our consumer facing businesses are a critical contributor to that broad base. While Consumer, Diabetes Solutions and Vision Care are different stages in their transformations and represent unique opportunities, we are driving scale and growth in all of them. Before I turn it over to Dominic, I would like to share some perspective on how Johnson & Johnson is capitalizing on the way technology is reshaping the entire healthcare landscape. The consumerization of healthcare, wearables and mobile apps are giving patients unprecedented access to health information. Physicians, regulators and payers are leveraging big data, analytics and real world evidence to personalized care, understand product safety and efficacy and drive improved outcome. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced centers are creating new opportunities to take advantage of the best clinical and wellness expertise. We are at the tipping point, where technology is becoming the medium through which healthcare can become a more effective and efficient system. The opportunities this creates for Johnson & Johnson to become a healthcare technology innovator are immense. We have identified key technology areas that will accelerate growth and are actively pursuing programs and partnerships in those areas. The relationships with Google and with IBM and Apple that Alex mentioned are great examples. There are others in the works and more to come. We are working with and talking to nearly every major technology company and many early stage companies. We are collaborating with retailers like Walgreens and CVS, where care is increasingly delivered, health plans like Aetna and Kaiser Permanente and health systems such as Jefferson Health and Premier to leverage technology digital tools and our health and wellness expertise. We find that Johnson & Johnson is most often the partner of choice for technology providers. We have the patient and consumer insights, the clinical and behavior modification expertise and the regulatory experience that can combine with technology to transform the continuum of care. This is particularly exciting when you think about the work that we are doing with payers and providers as in our work with IBM and Apple. We are creating an ecosystem embedded in hospital networks, which gives us the ability to integrate the right patient data with the right record and the right clinical outcome in the healthcare IT infrastructure. I have been in healthcare long enough to have heard over and over again that technology was going to disrupt the industry beyond recognition. But today, maturing technology, scientific advances and global healthcare reform are combining to make disruption a reality. Today, technology is intrinsic to the business. As the world\u2019s most broadly based healthcare company, we are uniquely positioned to be the company that connects the fragmented world of healthcare. Now let me summarize. Our consumer facing businesses are executing well against focused strategies. They are demonstrating results, improving profitability and growing. They have strong presence in the world\u2019s fastest growing markets and are building insight-led innovation pipelines. Each business is strengthening its brand building capabilities, actively managing its portfolio and leveraging technologies in ways that increase efficiency and create competitive advantage. Across J&J, we are using technology to unlock the power of the enterprise, to improve patient and financial outcomes in ways that will create value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. And we are building what I firmly believe is the best team of leaders in the industry. With that, I will turn it over to Dominic and I look forward to answering your questions. Dominic Caruso : Thanks Sandi and good morning everyone. As you have heard on the call, we are certainly pleased with the progress we continue to make in the execution against our priorities, which is reflected in the solid underlying financial results we have achieved thus far in 2015. And as Alex and Sandi discussed, we are well-positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. I will take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter and we will also then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2015. As we expected and as many of you on the sell side also reflected in your updated models, direct comparisons to our second quarter of 2014 are challenging due to the exceptional uptake of OLYSIO that we recorded last year as well as currency headwinds and the impact of not having Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics in our results for 2015. Our sales results for the second quarter 2015 were essentially in line with analyst estimates as reflected in First Call. On an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep C products, sales were up 5% for the quarter. Please now direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter are down 6% compared to Q2 2014 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 versus $1.78 a year ago are down approximately 4%. However, the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. And excluding the net impact of currency translation, our operational earnings per share was $1.90 or up 6.7%. There were no significant non-GAAP adjustments in the 2015 second quarter other than the exclusion of the expense for amortization of intangible assets. Now, let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. As we have said before, we would use any gain from divestitures in 2015 to offset the lower earnings impact of not having the OLYSIO sales uptake we had in 2014 and to provide some offset to currency headwinds, while also allowing continued investment for future growth. This quarter\u2019s results reflect just that. Cost of goods sold was 90 basis points lower than the same period last year mainly due to favorable product mix somewhat offset by currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 30.3% of sales or 220 basis points higher as compared to the second quarter of 2014. We are investing in a responsible manner and the absolute spending level is comparable to the prior year mainly due to the impact of currency as we continue investment spending behind our key brands on a global basis. The prior year percent to sales level was artificially lower since there was very little spending in relation to OLYSIO sales. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12% and 170 basis points higher than the prior year as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. Interest expense, net of interest income, was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of $900 million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $200 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.1 billion compared to a net gain of $300 million in the prior year period. This quarter we recorded the gain on the previously announced divestiture of the NUCYNTA product. Excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, the effective tax rate for the 6-month period was 22.3% compared to 21.1% in the same period last year. As I noted during our call in April, the effective tax rate this quarter is again higher than our guidance for the year as it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that legislation has not yet been passed although we expect that it will be. The effective tax rate is higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the mix of earnings being higher in the United States this year. Now, I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $15 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I am pleased to report that we completed our share repurchase program to help offset the ongoing impact of the OCD divestiture. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a gain ranging from approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance. As a reminder, this includes the gain from the divestiture of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA pain medicine as well as the anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health, which we expect will close towards the end of 2015, subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have also refined our estimates for the items in this account now that we are halfway through the year. As I also noted in April, the guidance for other income and expense will flow through to increase operational earnings as we expect to use this other income to compensate for the decreased income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014 as well as to help mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year, while we also continue to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth. And now, a word on taxes, our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress although that has not yet occurred. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015, excluding special items, of approximately 21% to 22% consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved that would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015. Now, turning to guidance on sales and earnings, consistent with our previous guidance for sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are expecting a generic entrant for INVEGA in 2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe, following the patent expiration in many countries in February of this year. As we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. It\u2019s the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C products, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014. And just to note, we are monitoring the situation in Greece as the country considers its path forward economically. We do not anticipate any significant negative impact to our sales results for 2015, nor to our earnings for 2015, unless there is a significant change in the current expected resolution. As of last week, the euro was lower by approximately 17% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar has strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And though we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range between negative 5% and negative 6% for a total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $70 billion to $71 billion. This is consistent with our previous guidance. And now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions. And although they are hedged, it is still somewhat negatively incremental versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range between $6.70 to $6.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 5% to 6%. This is higher than our previous guidance as we have increased the lower end of the range, reflecting some operational improvements in the business and our confidence at this point in the year. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range between $6.10 to $6.20 per share. At this stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which is higher than our previous guidance. So, in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C products, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is a solid 6% for the full year 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014. And with regard to earnings, on a constant currency basis, our guidance on operational EPS growth is strong and in the range of between 5% and 6%. And finally, as we execute on our growth plans, we are continuing to make portfolio choices and investments in our business, particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipelines across the enterprise, which will position us for sustained future growth. And now, I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. And Holly, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Novarro : Good morning. Question for Alex, in your first couple of years, Alex, you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with divestitures divesting cardio devices, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and consumer brands. As you look at the enterprise now, do you think we are finished with the divestitures? Question one. And question two do we now enter a period where the company is more focused on acquisitions? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey, good morning Glenn, Alex here and thank you very much for your question. Glenn, 3 years ago when we started looking at our strategies going forward, we tried to outline a very clear path ahead that would really consist of multiple components. One is obviously continuing to invest in our organic businesses, both in sales and marketing and research and development and I think we demonstrated that in spite of a lot of different puts and takes that we have continued to do that in a responsible way as Dominic outlined earlier when he was taking you through the P&L. An area where we did have a lot of focus was on making sure that our businesses were competitive, then of course, we tried to be very clear in that criteria there that look we want to be number one and number two in the marketplace. We want to have a clear innovation or technology path to really help patients or consumers or very importantly, we wanted the business to be complementary to something else that we are doing in another area of the enterprise and of course just fundamentally be a strong business. And if they didn\u2019t meet those criteria, then of course we consider other options where they maybe better served in someone else\u2019s hands. And as you noted, we have demonstrated that we are willing to do that as well. We think that\u2019s an ongoing process in the business. We would expect there, business our size is in excess of $70 billion involved in the numerous platforms. That\u2019s something that you will see as part of our natural cadence and flow going forward. But clearly, we are always also interested in growth opportunities. And when we see strong innovations that really make a difference for patients that also where we feel it offers a great complement to one of our existing franchises or frankly a platform for significant growth into the future, we have got the balance sheet, we have got the wherewithal to make those investments and that\u2019s always the priority for us and will remain so into the future. Glenn Novarro : And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at the pipeline of M&A potential, number one, would you call the pipeline meaningful, in other words there are a lot of rich targets out there. And then as you look at these targets, what do you see in terms of the valuation of these targets, are these targets getting stretched and is that maybe one of the reasons why you haven\u2019t done as much M&A here in the last few years? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : No Glenn, thank you. Look, we do feel that there are several significant opportunities really across each one of our segments that offer potential for growth and that are consistent with the strategic outline that I mentioned earlier. At the same time, I think we demonstrated that we want to be thoughtful and disciplined about our approach. And we intend to continue that path going forward. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Hi, good morning everybody. I was just wondering Dominic, if you can maybe just walk us through just again with the disposition of Cordis, just kind of what you are assuming in terms of timing of the sale of the business and then the dilution, how we should think about that, should we think about that similar with the OCD business in terms of the use of the proceeds perhaps with another round of repurchase to offset dilution again or kind of how we are thinking still about cardiovascular? Dominic Caruso : Sure, Kristen. Well, we expect that the Cordis divestiture will close in the latter part of the year. We still have some regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. So we would expect that towards the end of the year, that\u2019s been consistent with our previous discussion, nothing has changed there. The dilution of not having Cordis as part of the business is not that significant, quite frankly not as much as it was for OCD. As you know, that business after we exited the drug-eluting stent business is a relatively small portion of our business. And then with respect to use of proceeds, as we do typically when we do divestitures we wait after the transactions are complete, look at other opportunities we have for the use of cash and then make our decisions then as we prepare our plans for the coming year. So as of now, I really can\u2019t comment on what we might do with any of the proceeds. Alex Gorsky : Hi, Kristen, this is Alex. I just might also add that cardiovascular remains an area of strategic importance for us. We have a very strong Biosense Webster business. In fact, if you look at the quarterly performance for the second quarter, which is once again double-digit. I think this reflects almost 3 years or 4 years now of consecutive improvements in that performance at a very similar level, a great flow of new technologies that\u2019s really making a difference for patients. We also think cardiovascular, so look it still remains a global healthcare issue with a lot of innovation. So it\u2019s an area where we remain interested and we still feel we have very solid footing with our Biosense Webster EP business. Kristen Stewart : Got it. And then just maybe can you give us a little more color just on REMICADE, I know that that\u2019s obviously been a key concern of investors just what you are seeing in the quarter and kind of expectations ahead just with respect to the business over in Europe with biosimilars? Louise Mehrotra : So in the quarter, Kristen we had in the export sales, we actually had an inventory change that negatively impacted the reported results there for the pharmaceutical group by about 2%, what we are seeing in Europe is as expected, so for the countries that went off patent in February 2015, we are seeing about market share for the biosimilars in the mid single-digits, so as expected. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Mike. Mike Weinstein : Hi, good morning. Let me turn to the pharma side for a minute, I think two products that people focused on in the first half of the year for impact of the competition were STELARA and INVOKANA, INVOKANA looks like the momentum has continued and continues to look fantastic, STELARA looks like it slowed this quarter, so could you just comment on both? Alex Gorsky : Yes, Mike, Alex. Look, we still see STELARA growth at over 15%, strong growth in the U.S. and particularly strong growth outside of the United States at almost 27%. There was a slight sequential decrease in share we are projecting, but overall if we look at the competitive profile of the product, how we are doing combined, frankly with our overall franchise presence that we see in this area, we remain really confident in it. Mike Weinstein : And any comments on INVOKANA? Alex Gorsky : INVOKANA is the same, I think look we continue to highlight the profile. We have a got great reimbursement, well in excess of 50% to 60% in both commercial as well as the Medicare side of the business. We have continued to see strong TRx trends, both in primary care well as endocrinology. So overall, we are seeing strong uptake and we think it\u2019s a big opportunity, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Alex, while I have got you here, it\u2019s been 3 years since you guys closed the Synthes acquisition and I am sure as you commented, you are not thrilled by the first half performance in trauma and spine, so can you just talk a little bit about how you are feeling about that deal and what it will take to get it back on track? Thanks. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. Look, overall we absolutely believe it was the right move when to bring Synthes in and create the largest and most diversified Orthopaedics company. And when we reflect back there, there have been changes that have taken place in the market. One is just the market growth across all these segments. If you remember back in 2008, 2009, 2010, we saw high single-digit growth really for our hips, knees, trauma as well as spine. That has changed significantly. We are now seeing that in the 3% to 4% range. I am pleased with the performance overall that we have seen through the integration. Whenever you bring two large organizations together, there is always a lot of moving pieces. But I think over the last 3 years if you take a look at the overall disruption and the way that we have been able to manage it, I think the team has done a very good job. And now we are really focused on what do we do to ensure that we are best positioned for the future. And frankly, we are doing it at a time when a lot of our competitors are just getting ready to go through a significant amount of integration and transition. And this is where we are excited. And I think it starts with innovation. We have had a nice cadence of innovation. In fact, we are in the midst \u2013 we just launched the TFNA, the transfemoral nail in trauma that we are excited about. We think will be an important addition to the bag \u2013 to the portfolio that part of the business. In the U.S., we were encouraged by the performance that we saw in knees and hips at 5% and 4% growth, respectively for the quarter. And also going forward, I think we are also quite excited about the opportunity to work with customers in new, unique and different ways across that portfolio. And I also think it\u2019s fair to say that in all those areas we are going to continue to look for ways to drive that business through innovation, but also through increasing our effectiveness and efficiencies across all areas as well. So I think we are pleased, we are not satisfied, there is more work that we need to do and that\u2019s where we are focused right now. Mike Weinstein : Thanks Alex. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two clarifications, on the utilization comments about the fourth consecutive quarter of improving utilization, is that through Q1 or Q2. And then second on REMICADE outside the U.S., by our math we had total international and export sales growth in Q2 down about 18% constant currency, Louise you talked about that 2% impact from the inventory reduction, was that to that 18 or so percent, was that just the REMICADE outside the U.S., could you help clarify those two points, that would be great? And I have just one follow-up for Alex after that. Louise Mehrotra : So Larry, that 2% is on total pharmaceutical sales. So, it\u2019s a large reduction in the inventory. Larry Biegelsen : Total worldwide pharma? Louise Mehrotra : Yes, yes. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. And then on the utilization, was that through Q1 or Q2? Alex Gorsky : Yes, Larry, Alex here. That was through Q2. And again, you know this data as well as we do and we are trying to triangulate from multiple different sources, but what we see is, for example, around 4% growth in hospital admissions. If you take a look at hospital surgical procedures, we are thinking probably between 2.5% and 3% and if we look at overall outpatient procedure growth, probably around 3%. So, it\u2019s still positive. In some cases, it\u2019s flat, perhaps a slight decrease versus what we saw in Q1, but we think overall the trends are relatively constant what we have seen thus far. Larry Biegelsen : Good, good. That\u2019s helpful. And I appreciate your comments earlier on M&A and the M&A environment, but you have $15 billion in net cash, which is obviously not earning much. I know your first priority for cash is the dividend and then M&A. But at what point do you consider using your cash to repurchase shares, Alex? Thanks for taking the questions. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Larry. I think look overall, ultimately, we want to create more value for shareholders. And as we look at our capital allocation strategy you just iterated, we have a strong commitment to dividends. We have done that for a long time. You know our statistics and our track record there. Regarding M&A, it\u2019s also another area obviously that we keep our eye on. I mentioned earlier in the discussion that we are always looking for the right opportunity and we try to do that in a balanced approach. Of course, we want innovation. Of course, we want complementary things to add to our portfolio of growth opportunities, but we also want to ensure that we maintain the discipline and the perspective of our approach that I think has served us well over a lot of years. And even if you look at the internal versus external investment in the company, I think if you look over a 20, a 10 or even the near-term period, about 45% of our growth comes from what I call organic investment in our research and development versus slightly over half through M&A. And so that will continue to be our approach. Dominic Caruso : Also Larry, I would say that if you look at it over long periods of time, I think we are very proud of the fact that over a decade, we have returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders. So, I think it\u2019s important to keep that in mind although we may be evaluating opportunities all the time, we are always mindful of the fact of appropriate return to shareholders consistently over long periods of time. Alex Gorsky : Yes. And I think even recently through some of the announcements that we have made about share repurchases, we have demonstrated that, that\u2019s part of our mix and we will continue to be so going forward. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions. Louise Mehrotra : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Jami. Jami Rubin : Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of follow-up questions on sort of the major themes of the earnings call, Alex and I appreciate your taking the time to be on the call. Just if you look at the MD&D business, the MD&D business has underperformed its peers for at least the last 4 to 5 years and maybe longer, I am not sure, but I can\u2019t imagine you are pleased with that performance. And I am just wondering, what is your interest level in moving up the technology curve out of what you are in which are mostly commodity businesses? When I look across where the major growth opportunities are in MedTech, you guys aren\u2019t there, robotics, transcatheter heart valves, et cetera. So, I appreciate valuations are high and you want to be disciplined, but at the same time, J&J\u2019s MD&D business continues to under perform. So, if you could comment on that, please? And then secondly to you, Dominic, you are looking about $2 billion in non-operating income in 2015 largely related to divestitures, how do you repeat that performance in 2016 without creating again a very difficult comparison? Thanks very much. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Jamie, thank you for the questions. Look, first of all, as I said regarding our medical device businesses, we think this is an important business and remains a very solid growth opportunity going forward. And look as you look across that entire business, we have a number of very exciting areas, frankly, that are doing quite well. We highlighted some of them earlier whether it\u2019s Biosense Webster, whether it\u2019s what we are seeing in areas like biosurgicals, energy, our Endocutter business, we are starting to see the turnaround in areas such as vision care and we don\u2019t think those are commodity businesses. We think those are driven by innovation, technology, and they have been a steady strain. Now, are there other areas where we are interested? Well, you know that we have made an investment in the robotics space. We have announced an exciting opportunity with Google. It\u2019s still early days. We recognized that, but we think that there is a lot of opportunity there given our expertise in general surgery overall and combining it with some of the expertise that those new technology partners can add. And we are also interested in other areas beyond that. We have demonstrated the ability in the past that when we see them, we will participate and acquire them. And I think we have also demonstrated over the past few years that in areas where we don\u2019t see that path forward that we will be active on the divestiture front as well. So, we think that there is room for improvement. We know that we have got businesses like diabetes care, for example that had a significant impact from pricing a few years ago, vision care, that\u2019s still in the midst of a turnaround, but we think that we have got the strategies, the innovation in place to turn those around, and these can be very solid and strong performance going forward. Dominic Caruso : And Jami, with respect to the other income and expenses, $2 billion roughly that you quoted, I think we were very clear early in the year that we were going to use those divestiture gains to offset some pretty significant headwinds and in particular the major headwind of currency this year. Going forward, I don\u2019t believe we will have the same level of divestiture income, but we will still have some. As Alex have mentioned earlier, we are continuously reviewing our portfolio and making decisions of where we want to participate and where we think the assets would be better off in someone else\u2019s hands and where we could get value for our shareholders by selling the assets. So, I think for \u201816, we would still see some level of divestiture income, but again in \u201816 versus \u201815, we won\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t believe we will have the significant headwinds of currency that we just experienced in \u201815 nor will we have the tough comparisons of not having OLYSIO. So, I think you will continue to see it as part of our strategy to reevaluate our portfolio and deploy those gains against higher growth opportunities. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. And I just want to clarify something on the inventory for the pharmaceuticals. The 2% negative impact includes also some inventory reductions for OLYSIO. So, if you just look at the REMICADE export, total U.S. impact would be about 1%, about half of that, okay? Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning, Josh. Josh Jennings : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I would like to have first one for Dominic, just as we look into 2016 and beyond and the annualization of OLYSIO and other headwinds experienced in \u201815, how should we be thinking about leveraging the P&L driving a higher level of EPS growth relative to revenue growth? Should we be anticipating consistent constant currency EPS growth in 100, 200 basis points range or could that spread improve as you experience operating improvements in consumer and the device franchises and the continued strength in the pharma unit? Dominic Caruso : Yes, thanks, Josh. Well, as we have said many times, we always plan our business to grow our top line at a rate faster than the competitive set and then grow the bottom line at a rate of growth that\u2019s slightly faster than the top line growth. That depends each year on what investments we want to make to continue the growth trajectory of the business. So, I can\u2019t give you a formula to think about, but I think you have seen us be very consistent in our ability to continue to grow earnings at a rate that\u2019s appropriately at a level faster than sales, again, depending on what the market is doing and then depending on what particular investments we have. We do see increased profitability in the consumer business, but as you mentioned it in your comments and Sandi had referred to it earlier, now that we are through many of the issues in the consent decree, we saw the increase in the profitability last year and we expect that business will continue to contribute more profitability in the future. Josh Jennings : Thanks. And just a follow-up on the pharma product specific question, there is some recent ANDA filers for ZYTIGA, can you just talk about any inherent risk of a generic coming to the U.S. market prior to \u201816 and just an update on your patent positioning for that asset? Thanks a lot. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. So, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, the composition of matter patent expires in December 2016 and the method of treatment patent expires in August 2027. We would not speculate on any ANDA approval timing or outcome of any litigation. However, if we decide to file a lawsuit, the 30-month stay would begin April 2016 at the earliest and the length of which will be of course subject to any outcome of any litigation. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you and next question. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning Vamil. Vamil Divan : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just two here, if I could. One, you talked a little bit about INVOKANA earlier, I know Mike asked about this as well, but just about halfway through the quarter, we did have the FDA comment around ketoacidosis and just curious I mean obviously performance was fine this quarter but any on a qualitative basis it gives sense from any sort of questions or changes in prescribing habits as a result of what the FDA has stated at this point. And then second, I appreciate your comments on Greece, I was just curious also regarding Puerto Rico, just some of that kind of macro issues that are going on there I know you guys have some manufacturing down there, do you sense any sort of risk or concerns there depending how that sort of plays out over the next few weeks or months? Louise Mehrotra : We will take first the questions on the DKA, it\u2019s early on, but our Phase 3 trial is actually included about 10,000 patients and we saw very few cases of it. Alex Gorsky : Right. And with respect to Puerto Rico, you are right we have a significant manufacturing presence there and significant employment on the island, of course as a result. But I don\u2019t see that as a major factor in our ability to continue progressing with our plans. So it's not on our radar screen as a major issue to contend with. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I think I heard Alex mention $1 billion in cost savings by 2018, I just wanted a little clarity, is that a new program or is that a program that I thought you introduced a couple of years ago? Dominic Caruso : This is Dominic, Jayson. It\u2019s the program that we introduced a couple of years ago. We are a couple of years into it now and so we are already seeing some of those cost benefits. And Alex is describing the same program where we the looked that by 2018 if you compared it to base year of 2013, the overall cost reduction would be in the aggregate of $1 billion. Jayson Bedford : And how far along are you, are you at 50%, 60%? Dominic Caruso : We kicked it off in \u201813. We did a lot of planning, of course in \u201814. So we are just starting to ramp it up this year into the next couple of years. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And then maybe a question for Sandi on the consumer side, you have added investment over the last few years to support the are-launch of the OTC products, but margin seem to improve nicely over the last few quarters, does the added investment wind down to generate better margins or just the growth pick up to improve margins? Sandi Peterson : Thanks for the question. The way in which we are looking at this is the \u2013 as we are sun-setting the consent decree, it enables us to improve the productivity of our manufacturing footprint. So a large part of where you will see continued improvement in the profitability of the business is by improving our COGS and our gross margins for the business. So that\u2019s one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is we are \u2013 we have undertaken over the last couple of years an approach to globalize our brands and to globalize how we manage them, which drives increased efficiency in every single marketing dollar. So our perspective on this is we need to continue to invest behind these brands, both the U.S. OTC portfolio as well as the global portfolio. So you will not see us reduce our investments behind our brand building of all of our core brands, but what you will see is improved leverage in our manufacturing footprint and actually how we are spending those dollars to drive improved profitability across the sector. Alex Gorsky : Jason, this is Alex. If I can just add, I really want to commend Sandi and Jorge and their teams for the job that they are doing on these re-launches. I think when we were having these calls several years ago, there was probably a fair amount of skepticism on our ability to re-launch against private label, making sure that we can work our way through the consent decree requirements. And if you look at the progress that\u2019s been made over the past few years, obviously it starts with great products. I think now we have over 80% of our brands return to the shelf, a lot of new recent launches, particularly along the TYLENOL line. If you combine that with the way that we have achieved all the consent decree requirements, I think we worked closely with the agency. We have done that. In fact, I think we will be the \u2013 if not the one of the only large over-the-counter companies to ever be able to do that successfully. And really good news is that when you look \u2013 as we re-launch these brands, the share uptake is strong. I think we are back up to now about 60% of the share that we achieved in areas like pain. So we are building our way back up. And when you combine that with some of the new innovations that we have, we definitely see a nice growth opportunity in that part of the business. Louise Mehrotra : So with respect to everyone\u2019s time, we will take two more questions. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning David. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks Louise for squeezing me in, maybe just a question for Alex and Sandi and a quick follow-up for Dominic, but the Consumer business is clearly recovering, that\u2019s the big message I think of this call and I think the commentary, I think you have made publicly these last few months seems to be that for M&A in Consumer, it\u2019s going to center more on brands and not company, so you see more willing in consumer at least from our estimation to rule out large M&A, am I reading that right and why is that the case? Sandi Peterson : So our first \u2013 the way in which we are thinking about acquisitions in consumer is a combination of things. We are going to clearly stay focused on our priority consumer need states and geographies. So the way we look at it is a combination, are there brands that are appropriate to tuck into our infrastructure to drive growth in certain markets or in certain areas at the consumer need state. But we also will look at technologies that we can license in like we have done in other parts of J&J. And lastly, we do look at companies to acquire, whether they are mid-size companies or whether they are larger companies. And we are highly disciplined about looking at those and understanding the benefit of doing those kinds of larger acquisitions versus mid-size or smaller acquisitions. So we haven\u2019t ruled out any particular part of the marketplace. We are looking at a variety of different opportunities given that the business is now stabilizing, growing again. We believe we are sort of in a position where we can look at these things a little bit more on an ongoing basis. Alex Gorsky : Yes. And David, I would just add onto that that the Consumer area remains one of strong strategic importance for Johnson & Johnson. When you think about the role of consumers and healthcare utilization going forward, when you think about the way that you are able to drive innovation and frankly when you think about the reach that it gives you, particularly in the emerging markets and the fast growing markets. And by the way, for Johnson & Johnson, it not only operates that way to drive growth in consumer, but it acts also as a way to increase our uptake in our other businesses, particularly in those growth markets. We think there are a lot of opportunities. And I think mission one over the past few years has been getting it on the right track. As you mentioned yourself, we think we made a lot of progress there. We are feeling much, much better. And now we are obviously looking for ways how do we expand that, how do we take it to the next level. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. Thank you for that color. And then, Dominic just a quick question, I am just thinking about international growth, this quarter was a little slower, I am just wondering if you can give us an update on what you are seeing macro in emerging markets maybe specifically China just given the events the last month, have you seen any acute slowdown or is it relatively stable? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : So we have seen in China some slowdown. I wouldn\u2019t call it acute. There are some dynamics, of course of generic competition in China and an overall slower growth in economic growth. So we are seeing that, but I think we are well positioned. We have been in China for many, many years. We have a good footprint there. We obviously manufacture there as well and our brands continue to get good uptick there. And of course, we are not in the generic part of the pharmaceutical business in China because we are focused more on innovation in that market. So I wouldn\u2019t call it acute, but I would say we have seen some slowdown in the overall market growth in China. David Lewis : Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra : Last question please. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise : Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning everybody. Alex, maybe just a question for you and then one for Sandi, you talked again and you highlighted your focus on the OR the future and talking about the Google JV and robotics, can you maybe give us a little more concrete color, I mean is there a grand plan, does it require acquisitions, are we going to see some tangible products or launches that are going to impact sales and earnings over the next 6 months to 12 months, how do you want us to think about it? Alex Gorsky : Rick, when you think about this as a really strategic investment in the future for robotic surgery and we \u2013 as we see the surgical suite continue to develop in today\u2019s environment, I would say there is a pretty clear line of demarcation between what you would say as standard surgery and robotic surgery. And we think as technology develops in the future, whether it\u2019s real-time data collection, whether it\u2019s visualization, whether it\u2019s incorporating some of the new technologies in areas, such as energy and hemostats, combining these in very new and unique approaches we think offers a real significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes ultimately to grow our business. We also think there was some inherent limitations to today\u2019s robotic surgery environment when you frankly look at the size and the scale of some of the existing innovation. And if you look at what\u2019s happened with other technology platforms as they have become smaller, more flexible, more mobile, and frankly have a better ability to integrate various activities around the OR, that\u2019s where we think we can really make a difference. We realize, of course, that we bring certain capabilities to the table, but we are also thinking \u2013 working with partners like Google and others. It expands our capabilities significantly. And so, look, we see this as really not something to have an impact, where I would say over the next 6 to 12 months, this is likely more over a 2-year to 3-year plus timeframe, but we \u2013 this is something that we are quite committed to that our partners are committed to and that we see as a real opportunity to fundamentally change the way we think about surgery and robotics in the future. Rick Wise : I really appreciate that. And just last quickly, Sandi, I mean, it seems clear that VIBE is off to a strong start, I think you launched it in the U.S. late last year, maybe just talk if you could give us a little more color on the rollout where are you, are you fully rolled out, are you converting your own patients to VIBE, or are you gaining new accounts just \u2013 and maybe what\u2019s next beyond VIBE? Thanks so much. Sandi Peterson : Thanks. So, as you \u2013 in insulin delivery in total, what we have done is as you know we have launched the product in Europe and also in Canada over the last couple of years. And both in Europe and in Canada, it also has a pediatric indication, which clearly gives it some unique differentiation in the marketplace. We effectively launched it in the United States really at the beginning of this year. So, we have seen significant positive growth in uptake of the product in the U.S., which is a combination of existing patients upgrading to the new product as well as gaining new \u2013 basically new to therapy insulin pumpers as well as there we have seen a lot of conversion from other pump platforms to our platform. We, in the second quarter, also filed for the pediatric indication for the U.S. product. And so obviously, the FDA will go through its review process, but we are hopeful that before the end of this year, we should have the pediatric indication, which will be a further uptick in the business in the U.S. and be very helpful to us in the U.S. As I also mentioned earlier, there is two other things in insulin delivery that we are very focused on, actually three, but two of them are working in partnership with Dexcom on a next-generation pump that really brings the best of what we have learned of how to make this much more user-friendly and effective with a patient as well as ensuring that we have got the right algorithm in the pump for insulin delivery. Combining that with the next generation of sensor, our current pump has that with Dexcom. And then we are also and have done a lot of work not just in the insulin side, but also in the BGM side of really creating a much better ecosystem for the patient to have information and data that helps them manage their condition much more effectively. And so we are using information technology in a smarter way going forward and we are seeing very positive impact of that, not just in the insulin delivery side, but in our core BGM business. So, that\u2019s another place that we will see a number of different things that we are going to be doing in this business. And last but not least, I mentioned that the Calibra patch pump is another great growth platform we believe for us, because it\u2019s really a unique to the marketplace way to help type 2 diabetics who are insulin-dependent, have a new way of getting their insulin delivered to them in a much more discreet way. So, there are lot of things in the works, there is a lot of things in our pipeline in insulin delivery. Rick Wise : Appreciate it. Thanks. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. We will have some closing remarks by Alex. Alex Gorsky : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. And look, in closing, I want to again extend our appreciation to all of you for joining today\u2019s meeting. We are pleased with the solid results we reported this morning, which as we discussed today, really do reflect the strong underlying growth we are seeing across the enterprise. And when you combine this with the actions we have taken to even further strengthen our core businesses and advance our pipeline, Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to continue to drive growth over the long-term. So, I wish everyone a great day and thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra : Good morning and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Gary Pruden, Worldwide Chairman Medical Devices. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I will begin by briefly reviewing the third quarter for the corporation and our three business segments. Next Gary will discuss our Medical Device business and the strategy for growth. Lastly, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Now, I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.1 billion for the third quarter of 2015, down 7.4% versus third quarter 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 0.8% and currency had a negative impact of 8.2%. In the U.S., sales were down 0.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.1%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 15.8%. On an operational basis, both Europe and Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., grew 2.7%, while the Asia Pacific Africa region grew by 1.2%. Growth in all regions was negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and hepatitis C sales underlying operational growth was 5.6% worldwide, 7.7% in the U.S., and 3.8% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $3.4 billion and earnings per share were $1.20 versus $1.66 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $437 million and a charge of $377 million for after-tax special items. 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of $144 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.49, representing decreases of 9.4% and 7.5% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.2%. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 3.1%, with the U.S. sales up 8.9%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 4% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 1.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by U.S. OTC and Skin Care, Women's Health outside the U.S. and Oral Care worldwide. OTC sales results were driven by strong U.S. growth of 22.4% with analgesics in the U.S. up nearly 29% due to increased share complemented by the reintroduction of Tylenol Arthritis including initial launch inventory. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12.5%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was 44.5%, up from 41% a year ago. Additional contributors to growth in the U.S. were seasonal inventory build for ZYRTEC and in the initial stocking for re-launched digestive health products. Results outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by the timing of the seasonal inventory build for upper respiratory products. As we noted last quarter, the build occurred in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. In U.S. Skin Care market share increases and a seasonal inventory build drove strong growth for AVEENO and NEUTROGENA. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women's Health products outside the U.S. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.7 billion decreased 0.3% with U.S. sales down 4.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.5%. New competitors in Hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 10.1%, 11.5% and 8.5% respectively. Important contributors to growth were INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, SIMPONI, STELARA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION, PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX, CONCERTA, XARELTO, and ZYTIGA partially offset by lower export sales of REMICADE. Strong momentum in market share increases drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 6.3% total prescription share or TRx within the defined market of type-2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was over 13% for the quarter and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA has greater than 80% preferred access across commercial and greater than 90% for Part D plans. Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake, particularly in Germany, France, and the U.K. IMBRUVICA is now approved in 60 countries. STERALA and combine SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth across all the major regions due to robust market growth combined with increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results due primarily to increased market share where CONCERTA growth was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generics by the FDA last November. As expected during the quarter we saw generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. We have launched an authorized generic of INVEGA. Strong results for PREZISTA were driven by the launch earlier this year of PREZCOBIX. Continued share growth drove results for XARELTO sales with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 15.8% up 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. As an update, during the quarter we received several Paragraph IV notifications from generic manufacturers advising that they filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of XARELTO in the U.S. before the expiration of the relevant patents listed in the orange book. The composition of matter patent owned by our partner Bayer is expected to expire in December 2020. However a patent term extension has been filed, which if fully granted with extend the patent to mid-2024. Further if we are granted pediatric exclusivity, this will provide an additional six months to the existing marketing exclusivity or patent term. We together with Bayer will vigorously defend the patents and have filed suit against the generic applicants. Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market at over 12.5% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was 27.1% of that market down approximately one point on a sequential basis due to increased competition. Outside the U.S., ZYTIGA achieved strong growth in Asia and Latin America, which was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to increased competition. REMICADE export sales were down over 40% with two-thirds of that decline attributed to sales to our partners in Japan due to an inventory draw down in preparation for our label expansion for a new indication. Additionally, the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe has negatively impacted results. I will now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.9%. U.S. sales increased 2% while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 1.3% worldwide with the U.S. up 2% and growth of 0.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Vision Care, Specialty Surgery, and Cardiovascular Care partially offset by lower sales in Orthopaedics and price declines in the diabetes care. Vision Care results was strong across the major regions driven by the introduction of new products. Market growth, share gains in certain segments and new product introduction drove the results for specialty surgery growth with worldwide bio-surgery growth of over 9%, energy growth outside the U.S. of approximately 6% and worldwide Mentor growth of nearly 13%. Cardiovascular care growth was driven by 9% worldwide increase in our electrophysiology business due to strong sales of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter. Solid growth in the U.S. for orthopaedics was offset by lower sales outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in inventory levels primarily in China. The introduction earlier this year of the TFNA nail drove U.S. trauma growth of approximately 5%. Additional contributors to the U.S. growth were strong double-digit sales of ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC, 3% growth in hips due to our primary stem platform and 2% growth in knees due to the success of the ATTUNE platform. In the U.S. positive mix from new product introductions partially offset negative price in the major categories. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary Pruden. Gary? Gary Pruden : Thanks, Louise. I'm pleased to be here today to share with you the terrific work that's taking place at our Johnson & Johnson Medical Device Group and why we\u2019re excited for the future. As you recall, Sandi Peterson provided an update on our consumer facing Medical Devices in the second quarter, so my discussion today is focused on our surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular businesses. I will provide our perspective on the market which we\u2019re operating, our unique advantages, our performance through the third quarter and most important our strategy to win. Before we begin, I thought it will be helpful to provide some framing around the business and the quarter performance overall. Our medical device business excluding the consumer facing medical device business and OCD has grown 1.8% on a year-to-date operational basis. When we adjust for the women's health and Cordis business, in addition to several non-recurring impacts on our business, the underlying year-to-date operational growth was 2.8%. Our stated goal is to lead in the categories in which we compete. Today across our portfolio we have strong platforms such as Endocutters and Biosurgery that are outperforming market growth. We have substantial platforms which we see growing solely such as wound closure, where we have roughly an 80% share and we've identified areas that require further attention and infusion of innovation. We believe we have sound strategies to achieve our leadership goals. Our driving growth through enhanced innovation and excellence in execution, design to get us two or above market growth in the next 12 to 24 months. In Medical Devices we\u2019ve been on the leading edge of industry consolidation. And our conviction has grown even stronger that our breadth, depth and scale can be leveraged to make it difference to those reserve. Throughout my remarks this morning, I will share examples of how the medical device businesses of Johnson & Johnson are stronger together and how together we will accelerate growth and innovation. We're competing in attractive global market growing at roughly 4% where we hold leadership positions in surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular electrophysiology. Demographics favored continued market growth as population's age, the incidence of chronic diseases grow and more people gain access to care globally. As both customers and providers seek to improve efficiency, effectiveness and manage escalating cost, consolidation has accelerated both within our global customer base and the industry. As one Medical Device Group, we enjoy unique market advantages today starting with the broad portfolio of medical offerings, surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular. And we have the financial and industry strength of Johnson & Johnson behind us that enables us to invest in growth platforms and bring comprehensive solutions to bear on global healthcare issues. In emerging markets, we have a substantial presence which delivered roughly 20% of our revenue through the third quarter of this year. Our annualized sales in China alone continue to expand and currently exceed $1 billion year-to- date. We have a strong leadership position in categories such as trauma, minimally invasive surgery and sutures that help us facilitate a tip-of-the- sword strategy to establish leadership scale in emerging markets where we can then expand our key growth platforms. And finally, we compete from a position of strength. The number one or two market positions in virtually every category in which we do business. As one Johnson & Johnson Medical Device Group aligned to a common strategy, we will accelerate the benefits of these advantages going forward Our sales year-to-date were driven by the strong performances our electrophysiology, endocutter, bio-surgery and international energy businesses, complemented by our solid results in joint reconstruction and sports medicine business. Partially offsetting this growth were lower sales of spine and women's health problems. Our 2015 results continue to be impacted by the relatively soft global market conditions. We are seeing the market in the U.S. improve but EMEA growth remains challenged and the emerging markets have slowed this year. We expect the soft market conditions and pricing challenges across the Board to continue. While we have strong category leaders across surgery, cardiovascular and Orthopaedics, we also have some opportunities to address platform challenges and reallocate resources to high growth opportunities in some of our platforms like trauma. In trauma we have seen mixed results in our performance. This has been an important area of focus since acquisition. However we have seen a lower level of innovation though due to a number of factors including the significant remediation effort to bring some of these up to Johnson & Johnson quality standards and the overall integration efforts during the last few years. Going forward, we are shifting more of our focus and resources to deliver new innovative products and target faster growing categories within the market such as elective foot and ankle. The recent success of our new Femoral Nail System TFN advanced demonstrates receptivity in this category to new and meaningful innovation. We also continue to strengthen the trauma franchise capabilities and high growth market such as U.S. and China. Additionally in trauma as across the entire portfolio, we recognize the value of strategic partnerships and helping us to achieve our aspirations. Through a new five year cooperation agreement between DePuy Synthes and the AO Foundation, we will continue to develop innovative products and solutions, train more surgeons to improve standards of care and treat more patients globally. With respect to the broader portfolio management, earlier this month we completed the divestiture of the Cordis business. Through portfolio of discipline we will continue to exit categories that do not fit our strategy and evaluate our portfolio to identify those growth categories or heavier R&D investment, external partnerships and L&A. In summary, we are sharpening our focus and investment on priority platforms that we believe will drive the majority of our growth. As I noted earlier, roughly 20% of our growth came from emerging markets and more than 50% of our revenue year-to-date has come from outside the U.S. In line with what you\u2019re hearing broadly about the economic slowdown of emerging markets, we see that too. But we are maintaining nice growth across our business in these markets. Consistent with that, over the next five years we continue to expect emerging markets to drive this proportional growth opportunities as access to quality health care continues to expand. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly a third of the world's global disease burden could be addressed through surgery. Yet nearly 5 billion people continue to lack access to safe, timely and affordable surgical care. Our goal is to reach more patients and restore more lives. We aim to achieve this through meaningful innovation and efforts to expand access to care including continued physician training. We are confident that the results will be improved standards of care for patients around the world and sales growth above industry rates or maintaining industry leading competitive margins. We have a clear strategy to achieve this - accelerate growth in priority platforms through innovation and launch excellence, sustain growth in our core platforms, leverage our breadth and scale through novel commercial models and invest in areas of significant unmet needs. This is a strategy we believe will deliver more value for customers and patients and for our company and shareholders. Our strategy starts with our three industry categories of surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular. Across the portfolio, we have identified six priority growth platforms in which we disproportionately invest to accelerate growth. These are the areas where the medical need continues to be significant and our capabilities are strong. In surgery, our priority platforms are endocutters and energy. Not only are we getting good response from our customers on these platforms which you are seeing in the numbers, but we're winning top awards for the design of innovative solutions that benefit the user, the environment and the business. You can see that we flag robotics as one of our key growth platforms here in surgery and I'll provide a little more on that later. In orthopaedics we are prioritizing our knees and trauma platforms. Knee replacement is the single largest selective procedure in orthopaedics. Over the next six years, worldwide knee market is expected to grow at 3.8% CAGR to around $9 billion. We believe we're well placed for growth with products and instruments from our ATTUNE platform and in cardiovascular, electrophysiology continue to deliver strong growth and is a priority platform for us through our Biosense Webster business. Additionally across these broad categories, we're targeting four core platforms in which we'll sustain growth and continue to divest in innovation. You can see here that in surgery the foundation platforms in the space are bio-surgery and wound closure. In orthopaedics, our hip business is a key platform and finally sterilization and disinfection, a core capability that addresses the still significant unmet need for preventing infection, which drives successive cost and extends healing time for patients. Let me be clear, this focused strategy is not to say that we will not invest in other platforms where we compete. There remain important areas for our future. We expect the combination of our priority and sustained growth platforms to deliver a significant portion of our growth over the next five years. These platforms will be a major contributor to our ability to grow above market in the coming years. We're focusing on the nine key geographies where we believe we can drive the majority of our growth. These markets are being targeted based on strong healthcare utilization outlook, large unmet need within medical devices and a strong Johnson & Johnson presence footprint within these markets. Last year at our Medical Device Investor Business Review, we discussed 30 significant filings that were planned by the end of 2016. We're well on the way to achieving that goal, which provides a consistent means of product introductions all contributing to growth. Those new product innovations combined with our aggressive reallocation of resources I just discussed complemented by our novel commercial models, positions us well to grow faster than the market. We've identified five disease states, five areas of unmet needs where we think we can make the greatest difference through innovation, internally or externally sourced. They include surgical oncology, obesity, select cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. We're exploring what will take a combination of products and end to end solutions to make the critical difference for physicians and patients addressing these needs and we'll take advantage of our strong balance sheet to invest in innovation that can make a difference in these areas as well as our priority technology platforms. We're taking a comprehensive approach to innovation and we're looking at this across a number of fronts including our go-to-market strategy. We're building novel commercial models that are adapting to market conditions and developing new strategic partnerships with our customers around the world. I'll expand on that area shortly. Our strategies are enhanced by the opportunity to leverage our scale and breadth. That begins with the core selling opportunities like the inclusion of DERMABOND PRINEO, our newest wound closure device designed for joint procedure, now in the bag of our joint reconstruction sales consultants. Needing time to closure in knee and hip replacement procedures, we're also implementing cross portfolio procedural development like the new OsteoView device, which leverages the harmonic technology from Ethicon to provide a soft tissue dissector, exclusively designed for spine procedures and to be sold by the DePuy Spine business. It extends further to our enterprise customer group, which works on key relationships with major hospital systems, who look to leverage unique Johnson & Johnson capabilities and our medical device agreements. Some great examples are a new relationship established with one of Germany's largest private hospital networks where we have a sole source contract for implants. Here in the U.S., we signed a five-year contract with the globally ranked academic medical center at Johns Hopkins. We're also executing an exclusive partnership with a large multinational hospital system to share risk and great value. These are just some of the most recent examples on how our clinical strength and organizational flexibility and scope provide an excellent roadmap for how we're engaging in a new way with customers today. Johnson & Johnson's substantial global footprint provides a foothold in key emerging markets and enables us to expand access to training to more surgeons and care for more patients. We are using that advantage to drive innovations that address unmet medical needs. Working with our partners in the pharmaceutical business, we recently announced that China lung center project which will work to bring our medicines, technologies and resources to bear, to address one of that country's leading cause of death and ultimately advance the scientific knowledge and practice of lung surgery around the world. Earlier this year we first shared with you the news about our collaboration with Google Life Sciences and surgical robotics. We continue to make progress on our goal of bringing to market a transformative surgical robotics platform. Our shared vision is to give surgeons advanced analytics and surgical access properly with an improved and flexible work flow dynamics in the OR and ultimately a reduced cost to serve. Through our Ethicon franchise we are contributing surgical know-how and developing advanced tools and instruments for superior, minimally invasive surgical technology. I'm pleased to share that we are in the development phase of the platform now and are working with respected global experts in the field of robotics to advance the effort. Additional information regarding our progress will be communicated in just the next few weeks. The global robotics market is roughly $2 billion and we expect procedures to grow at a double-digit growth rate. That said, today's robotics options are limited and requiring substantial financial and infrastructure investment and we believe that through technology advancements and agile application, our path in surgically assisted robotics is one that will best deliver what surgeons need. Our solution not only aims to give surgeons a better procedural experience by improving comfort and patient proximity, but delivers a superior surgical experience through greater access and precision with the ability to make more informed decisions through the entire procedure. We can see a future in which the surgeon is no longer isolated in the OR, but through our system we'll be able to connect to critical data, imaging and diagnostic information. Information that will help a surgeon make the best, most accurate decisions as and when they are needed. The system is being developed with both the healthcare provider and the economic buyer in mind. As one Johnson & Johnson medical device group, we are well positioned in our largest businesses to build on leadership position as these categories grow in response to changing demographics, evolving unmet medical needs, and expanding access to care. Across our portfolio, we are focused on the categories where we will grow and lead. We have exciting pipelines and a renewed focus on launch excellence that will deliver steady cadence of meaningful and differentiated innovation. At the same time, we seek to advocate for patients by advancing the standard of care through strategic partnerships and educational access and pushing the boundaries of medical device product innovation. We are deploying the comprehensive resources of Johnson & Johnson across the group which gives us unique leverage. And we're getting a positive response from customers. It is these strategic customer wins, combined with our more than 30 significant product launches that positions us to grow faster than our market and deliver value for the company and our shareholders. We look forward to telling you more about how our strategy is gaining traction at the medical device business review next May. Now, I'll turn it back to Dominic. Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Gary and good morning everyone. Let me just say that I really enjoy working alongside Gary in the management committee. He has clear strategies for accelerating growth through innovation and leveraging the breadth and scale of medical devices through novel commercial models. We are confident that we will see steady progress as the business under Gary's leadership implements very sound strategies for growth. Just this morning we announced a $10 billion share repurchase program. We are very well positioned to drive continued growth in shareholder value with our exceptional financial strength including our strong balance sheet and cash flow. We have a proven track record of returning capital to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend complemented by share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to invest in internal growth drivers and strengthen our robust pipeline and we continue to be active in accessing external opportunities to deploy our financial strength to further drive long-term value creating growth. We anticipate commencing the share repurchase program in the near term and intend to finance it through the issuance of debt. Repurchase of stock through the program will be made at our discretion from time-to-time and the repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Moving on to a review of the quarter, since Gary has just covered our medical device business, I would like to highlight several additional developments from this quarter in our pharmaceutical, consumer and the consumer medical device businesses. Our pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong underlying growth and as we discussed at our pharmaceutical Analyst Day earlier this year, our future cadence of new product filings is very robust. This quarter we filed for marketing authorization in Europe for daratumumab, a treatment for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma which received accelerated assessment from the CHMP. Daratumumab was also granted priority review in the US. We are also \u2013 we've also submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application to the US FDA for IMBRUVICA, for treatment of naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marketing authorization in Europe for once every three month formulation of paliperidone palmitate. In our consumer business, we are back to a consistent cadence of new products as we continue to reintroduce products back through shelves, as well as innovate across our beloved brands that you all know and use every day. In particular, the re-launch of TYLENOL Arthritis is doing very well. In our vision care business, we have anniversary pricing adjustments that have impacted growth rates and have also introduced new products such as 1-Day ACUVUE MOIST Multifocal, 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE, LACREON and ACUVUE OASYS or one week overnight, and in the fourth quarter, we are launching ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day HydraLuxe, an important advancement in comfort for contact lens wearers. I'll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the third quarter and we'll also then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year. We continue to execute well on our portfolio management strategy, consistent with the plans we laid out for the year and we're pleased with the solid underlying sales results and continued solid earnings per share performance thus far in 2015. We are well positioned for continued growth in today's dynamic healthcare environment. Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2015. As we expected, direct comparisons to our third quarter of 2014 are challenging, due to the exceptional uptake of OLYSIO that we benefited from last year, as well as currency heads winds. Our sales results for the third quarter of 2015 on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and excluding the impact of Hep C products were robust, up 5.6% for the quarter. This is in line with the annual guidance we set for 2015 and stronger than 2014 on a comparable basis. Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings, adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4.2 billion in the quarter, which are down 9.4% compared to the third quarter of 2014 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 versus $1.61 a year ago are down 7.5%, having been significantly impacted by currency movements as you may have expected. I am pleased to say that the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by FirstCall. Excluding the net impact of translation currency, our operational earnings per share was $1.63 or up 1.2%. In the quarter we incurred after tax special charges of $377 million which included litigation expenses associated with previously disclosed matters as outlined in our 10-Q filing, as well as intangible amortization expense of some $437 million on an after tax basis, which in this quarter also included the write-down of an intangible asset related to a small acquisition we made several years ago. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. This quarter's results reflect both the gain from our divestiture of the SPLENDA brand to Heartland Food Products Group which we closed at the end of the third quarter, and additional investments we made in the business. As we said before, we would use any gains from divestitures in 2015 to offset the lower earnings impact of not having the OLYSIO sales uptake we had in 2014 to provide some offset to currency headwinds, while also allowing continued investments for future growth. Cost of goods sold was 130 basis points higher than the same period last year impacted by both lower net sale prices as well as changes in product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were [20.7%] [ph] of sales. As a reminder, this line in the prior year period included the additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which we treated as a special item last year. Adjusting for that, this line item was 28.4% of sales last year. So this year\u2019s amount is 130 basis points higher as compared to the adjusted third quarter of 2014. As we have previously noted we're continuing to invest the drive growth in our key brands. Prior year percent of sales was artificially low as well since very little spending occurred in relation to OLYSIO sales. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.6% in the quarter and 160 basis points higher than the prior year, as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. Interest expense, net of interest income was a little lower reflecting higher earnings on our investment. Other income and expense was a net charge of $420 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $1.3 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items of both years. Excluding those special items other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $400 million compared to a net gain of approximately $40 million in the prior year period. This year's third quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestiture of SPLENDA. Excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, the effective tax rate for the nine months period was 21.6% compared to 22.1% in the same nine-month period last year. As I noted during our call in July, the effective tax rate for this quarter and for the nine-months this year does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, as that legislation has not yet been passed although we expect that it will be. The effective tax rate is lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the mix of foreign earnings to lower tax jurisdictions this year as compared to last year. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast, beginning with cash, and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $37 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt. This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold and we are actively looking for the right opportunities to use that capital to create greater value for our shareholders. As we have discussed before, we have a well known and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with paying dividends, followed by value creating M&A and then we consider other ways to return value to shareholders such as through a share repurchase program. To that end, as you know this morning we announced a $10 billion share repurchase program and we believe the Company shares on attractive investment opportunity and repurchasing our shares is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Although we are continuing to evaluate external growth opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash other than the share repurchase program we just announced. We suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $500 million just a slight tightening of the range from prior guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding any special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance. As a reminder, this now includes the gain sort of divestiture of the U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine earlier this year, the SPLENDA brand this quarter, and the Cordis business, which we closed just after the quarter and will be recorded in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in previous quarters, a portion of other income and expense will flow through to increase operational earnings as we expect to use some of these gains in other income to compensate for the decreased income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as to help us mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year for we also will continue to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth. And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress although that has not yet occurred. We will therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 21% to 22% and this is consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately half percentage point. Turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we\u2019ve done for several years our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current foreign exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. This is consistent with our previous guidance and now reflects the impact of the divestiture of the Cordis business offset by stronger performance in other businesses. Additionally by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the impact of hepatitis C products, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014. As of last week, the Euro was lower by approximately 16% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar strengthened versus virtually all major currencies. Although we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of this year, our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the weakening of the Euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range between negative 5% and negative 6%, for total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $70 billion and $71 billion. And now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions which although hedged, is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 50 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $6.75 to $6.80 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of between roughly 5.5% and 6.5%. The midpoint is higher than our previous guidance as we\u2019ve increased the lower end of the range reflecting some operational improvements in the business and our confidence at this point in the year. Again we're not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share, if currency exchange rates for all 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share which is consistent with the estimate we provided in our previous guidance. Therefore our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.15 to $6.20 per share. At this stage in the year, we are comfortable raising the lower end and tightening the range. So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and Hep C product competition, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is a solid 6% for the full year of 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014. And with regard to earnings, on a constant currency basis our guidance on operational EPS growth is strong in the range between 5.5% and 6.5%, which was higher than our previous guidance. And as we execute on our growth platforms, we're continuing to make investments in our business and we're prioritizing our portfolios. We remain focused on building our priority pipelines across the enterprise to position our company future growth and expanded leadership in markets around the world. Also I would like to thank the employees of Johnson & Johnson for what they do every day to make a difference to patients and consumers and for their continued significant contributions to growing our business. And now I would like to turn things back to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise? Louise Mehrotra : Thank you, Dominic. Manny, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] With that, your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start with the buyback. Maybe Dominic, you could talk about the timing. In the past you've done these pretty quickly. And it doesn't sound like, based on your comments, that it's a signal that the M&A targets out there aren't as attractive as you may have thought. Is that fair? Just from an EPS standpoint, by our math it's about $0.20. Then I had one follow-up. Dominic Caruso : Sure Larry, let me try to address each of those questions. So as far as the timeframe, it's an open-ended share repurchase program as we said. So there is no real particular timeframe, but just by way of reference the most recent share repurchase program that we implemented which was $5 billion in 2014 took about nine months to complete. So we continuously try to buy our stock at the appropriate prices throughout any trading period and just as a reminder, we're also simultaneously continuing to buy any stock that's issued in connection with our employee stock programs and that's about another $3 billion of cash utilized for that purpose. With respect to any read through on M&A activity this in no way has any negative impact on our outlook for M&A and our pursuit of value creating acquisitions to drive shareholder value. So we have the financial strength and flexibility to do both and we're very pleased to be able to continue to do that. As far as the EPS impact, again as you know this is always a tricky calculation because on a weighted average share calculation, but if it was fully implemented then a full year impact of a fully implemented $10 billion share buyback would be about two to three percentage points of incremental EPS growth. Now of course we won't see very much of that in '15 because we're just beginning and we'll see some of that show up in the 2016 earnings. We'll give you a better sense of that in January, but certainly by 2017 when it's fully implemented, we would see that total percentage positive impact that I just mentioned. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And then I feel compelled to ask one about the rhetoric coming out of Washington, Dominic, on pharmaceutical pricing and price controls, which has gotten a lot of media attention recently. Where do you see that ultimately going? What's J&J's perspective? And, just lastly, in the early 1990s I think a lot of pharmaceutical companies, when Hillary Clinton was trying to reform healthcare, pledged not to raise drug prices by more than inflation. Is that something that J&J would reconsider? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Larry. Let's see, well you're right. There has been a lot of rhetoric about pharmaceutical drug pricing and despite significant media attention on drug pricing, there really isn\u2019t a consensus on policy solutions that would lower prices without negatively impacting innovation, that's the key point. I think every time we talk about drug pricing, we unfortunately miss the balance of the other side of the coin which is of course the innovation that comes from the pharmaceutical industry and the improvement in the health and well being lives of many people around the world. The pharmaceutical industry has and continues to be a constructive partner in any of these policy debates and we look for solutions to the issue along with policy makers. Just as a reminder, as part of the Affordable Care Act industry agreed to increased rebates in Medicaid and many other additional fees that I know you're all very familiar with and as the U.S. healthcare system evolves, I think we'll have more of a focus on outcomes and value and we're working with both public and private payors to develop innovative outcome based contracts. We think the real answer to this dilemma is to monitor and provide outcome based metrics and not simply focus only on price. As far as a pledge Larry, I think we're very responsible in our drug pricing and we tend to support the price for our drugs with strong economic data. So rather than pledge to a particular number, I think it's important that we continue to develop robust data that provides a solid foundation for the value that our products provide to healthcare systems. So we'll continue to do that. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you for taking the questions. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, I thought I would turn the question back to devices here for a second. Two areas I wanted to focus in on. The first is on your innovation sectors, Gary, you talked about four or five of those areas are within or adjunctive to your dominant franchises in ortho and surgical. Then you have this commentary on select cardio areas. So, my question is, Gary, first, why even focus on cardio, an area where you have less dominant breadth? Is it just because there's innovation there and you're going to be selective? Then I had a quick follow-up. Gary Pruden : Thank you, David, and good morning. Yes, it's a great question. Listen we have I think been pretty consistent and when I had this conversation before that we see in cardiovascular there are interesting areas where there is a lot of growth opportunities and also unmet needs. I think we've talked about them before and said areas like CHF heart failure, structural heart are fast growing categories where there is a lot of unmet need and where we think we can add to our breadth that we have with the EP business currently. So as always we will be opportunistic in looking at opportunities both internally and externally to add to our portfolio. We think cardiovascular is a large category. Agreed we don't have the same scale as we do in surgery and orthopaedics, but we will look for opportunities to add to that scale with the appropriate types of investments that will create shareholder value in spaces where we think there is a lot of growth and opportunity. So we continue to look at that space. We've highlighted as we've done today remains an area where we've made some investments right because we do investments in small companies and technologies through our Johnson & Johnson Development Corp and we'll continue to evaluate the M&A field as well. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Gary, the other interesting commentary this morning obviously was on robotics. I know it's very early days here but I wonder if you could just give us some high-level strategic thoughts. And two areas of focus. One would be, should we expect very significant capital systems to be sold from J&J through this partnership or should we see more less expensive capital systems than perhaps are out there today? And a related question is how do you think about cost effectiveness? How do you think about the cost effectiveness of any disposables that you sell versus robotics relative to existing robotic disposables? Thank you very much. Gary Pruden : Thank you, David, and listen really good questions. Let me take the last one first. I think you saw in my presentation, cost to serve we see as an opportunity right. If you look at the robotics installed base as it is today, it's very much focused on the developed markets versus the emerging markets and that's because cost to serve is disproportionately out of balance. And we think that there are opportunities to have a much smaller footprint in terms of a technology, a lower cost to serve in terms of disposables as well as capital that we think can play across a broader range of surgical procedures in a cost effective way that improves the capability of the surgeon, provides real time data and analytics at their fingertips, greater OR flexibility and as mentioned there has an overall cost effectiveness which allows it to penetrate more procedures than what you see today. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering if, Dominic, you could go into a little bit further detail on some of the businesses that are contributing to basically give you confidence to increase the underlying guidance for sales. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Kristen. Well, the pharmaceutical business continues to do very well. The growth as you saw in the quarter, we exclude the impacts of OLYSIO was over 10%. So it's very solid growth. The consumer business is launching new products and getting those products back on the shelf and the cadence of new product introductions, as well as the uptake gives us encouragement that we're seeing very, very good results there. And some of Gary's businesses, although some are challenged as he pointed out, some continue to do very well, electrophysiology and others. So I think we're confident that despite losing a quarter of the sales from the Cordis business, the rest of the businesses are performing well enough to pick up that difference and we're comfortable maintaining our sales guidance for the year. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Then how should we just think about looking ahead in terms of Cordis being out, is there enough momentum to offset any dilution there or does the stock repurchase help offset some of that as we look ahead? Not giving guidance for 2016, but should we think of the share repurchase similar to what you did for the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics? Dominic Caruso : Well, there is two things going on here. I think one is of course the share repurchase will add incremental EPS growth that helps offset some dilution. But I think the real difference is we're not going to have the kind of headwind comparison that we had '15 versus '14 as we get into '16 and we feel that the momentum is strong going into '16. So I wouldn't characterize the share repurchase as solely related to offset the delusion of Cordis. I think it will be incremental to our EPS growth. Kristen Stewart : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thank you, guys. Dominic, with most of the cash, almost all of the cash, outside the US, and the incremental $10 million of US debt for the share repurchase, are you assuming that you'll be able to use at least a portion of that O-US cash for any meaningful M&A in the near term? Dominic Caruso : Mike, thanks for the question. We, as you know always look for tax efficient utilization of the OUS cash. As you know, we did that in the Synthes transaction a couple of years ago. So we'll do our best to structure any M&A activity in a way that can optimize the effective use of the OUS cash in a tax efficient manner. So we continuously work on that and our team is very good at developing strategies to do that, and - but more to come on that at a later time. Mike Weinstein : Understood. And is the $10 billion number the right number? Because it doesn't stress your ratings with the agencies. Dominic Caruso : Mike, I don't think $10 billion is necessarily related to stressing any credit rating. I think it - as we've said many, many times, we have a disciplined capital allocation strategy and share repurchases just happen to be third in line after M&A and dividends being first. So I think we're comfortable that doing $10 billion now, while we're still actively pursuing M&A activity is the right level to do now then we'll reassess that as that program begins to wind down. So I wouldn't necessarily think that this is a limit to what we can do at any time. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Then just one question for Gary, then I'll drop. Gary, one thing that stood out to me just this quarter, the pluses and minuses, on the minus side the O-US performance within the orthopaedic business, the spine business ex-currency was down 12%, trauma was down 6%. Can you shed any light on that? Gary Pruden : Yeah, Mike. As mentioned, we had some one-time items that were occurring outside the US in our orthopaedics business. One, as Louise had mentioned in our, in China where we had a distributor inventory issue with some slowing of the markets there. We had some - make some corrections to distributor inventories which predominantly hit the trauma business but all of them. And then also in Brazil we saw some registration issues happen as part of the integration and that also had an impact in slowing the business as well. So those two predominant items had a disproportional impact in the quarter. We don't see those as ongoing issues. We are still excited about the opportunities for the business, specifically trauma in emerging markets we see as an opportunity and we will continue to focus our efforts there. So yes, we were disappointed in that, but we do see them as one-time items and we are working through that as we speak. But we still see a lot of opportunity for the business outside the United States. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. Thank you, Gary. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So just a couple if I could on the pharma side. So one you mentioned on your diabetes with INVOKANA some of the market share information. I was just curious, obviously the positive data from Lilly on their SGLT2 inhibitor outcomes data. Have you seen any initial impact or do you expect to see much of an impact within through the INVOKANA given that you guys are obviously the market leader there in that class. And then just second, on the long-acting injectables, again you shared some insights. Just curious if you can share some thoughts with the new competition, a couple new players now in that space, how you think that might impact your growth looking forward? Thanks. Gary Pruden : Let me take the question on INVOKANA first. We do think that the positive benefits seen by the Lilly compound is most likely a class effect for SGLT2. It's too early to comment on any effect that we've seen. And we're also studying our compound regarding cardiovascular impacts. But that data is just a couple years away. But we do think there's a positive effect to the overall class as a result of the cardiovascular data that Lilly shared. With respect to long-acting injectables, Louise, any comments on market dynamics there, have you see, I haven't seen much already. Louise Mehrotra : We are still seeing strong growth in that market and we've also just introduced Trinza, which is the three month formulation. So we think we're in a very, very good competitive position there. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go you ahead. Glenn Novarro : Good morning, guys. Gary, two questions for you. First, if I look at the device business in terms of what you've done over the last few years, you've been divesting assets, cardio assets, the diagnostics business. As you go forward, as you look forward are there still businesses within your device portfolio that you think need to be divested because they are underperforming or do you see yourselves more as a net buyer of assets going forward? That's question one. And then question two. Gary, you highlighted you're going to be launching 30 new device products over the next year or so. When I look at the portfolio of products that you'll be launching, a lot of these I see as kind of singles, maybe double? And so I was wondering if you can look at that portfolio for us today, are there any products that actually could be bigger, what would be the products you think actually have the upside to get you back to market growth? Thanks. Gary Pruden : Thanks, Glenn. Good questions. So first, in terms of divestitures, as you know and how Dominic talked about it, which is we have a companywide premise that we should be number one or number two in the categories where we're committed and have a clear technology path to getting through either a number one or number two position. And if we don't, we're going to consider our options. So we have a very formalized process that we go through with the management committee and looking at our opportunities and we take on divestitures opportunities carefully as we've done in both the OCD and the Cordis situation. We will continue to do that portfolio analysis on an ongoing basis. So I can't really say what's going to happen. But certainly we will continue to look at our portfolio in terms of opportunities. We will also though continue to look at, Glenn, opportunities to acquire new businesses that we think are accretive, that will add to our business growth and create shareholder value. So I think in a disciplined focused approach where we divest we will also look at opportunities to acquire. I think certainly accelerating our pace of tuck-in deals would be a good opportunity for medical device we seek, considering our scale in the market, especially in surgery and orthopaedics is large, and we anticipate accelerating that pace over the next 12 to 18 months. In terms of the second question which was around opportunities as you look at our portfolio, you\u2019re right, we have a lot of \u2013 I\u2019ll call it \u2013 we call it singles and doubles, I would say we have a couple triples in there especially in the EP space that we think that will be some really game-changers. The big one that I would highlight for you which would be very different than anything else will be robotics. Now the category as mentioned in my talk is $2 billion growing at double digit, we see disruptive opportunity happening in the next couple of years here for us to take a substantial share of the market going forward with a very different technology that\u2019s integrated and delivers value for our customers. So, putting a lot of focus and efforts there which we think will be important and we are also looking at other opportunities for us from a L&A and M&A perspective to bring in exciting technology into our platform to accelerate growth as well. So we have a couple of areas that I would say where I think we got some really interesting things. Also I would say in the next MD&D day coming up in May, you will see a little bit of the pipeline where in some of the areas that I am excited about but probably too early to disclose right now. And we will give you a little bit more detail at that point in time. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thank you Louise Mehrotra : Next question please Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just to touch on the M&A topic for a second, Gary, you did touch on it a little bit, mentioned tuck-in acquisitions. But if we take a step back, two questions for you guys here. Number one, given the $10 billion share buyback announced today and the fact that that's priority number three, at least how you play it out, does that signal that your appetite for a large acquisition is maybe off the table and you will be focused more on the smaller, tuck-in type deals within pharma partnerships or in licensing deals? And then, number two, if you look across your businesses, where are the holes that you'd like to fill as you look at the markets that are higher growth that you don't currently play in? Dominic Caruso : Danielle, it\u2019s Dominic here, thanks for the question. I wouldn't interpret the $10 billion share buyback as impacting our appetite for scale of any size at M&A at all. Our appetite for M&A of any scale has entirely to do with whether or not the acquisition is going to create value for shareholders. And as you know we are disciplined about that. It is true that over our history, we have done many-many acquisitions and the largest ones are a few and far between but that has to do with what Gary mentioned with business of our scale, we can bring in lots of tuck-ins or licenses for example in the pharma business where we can get the most value for our shareholders in the most capital efficient manner. But it doesn\u2019t preclude us from that also looking for large scale acquisitions. As far as where we would look, in pharma we are focused on five therapeutic areas. I think we\u2019ll remain focused there. In consumer, as you know we have our core platforms of Skin Care, Oral Care, OTC in particular, as well as emerging market and for medical devices Gary, why don\u2019t I ask you to just comment on the areas of focus. Gary Pruden : Absolutely. I think if you look at one of the slides in our strategy to win, our innovation focus areas, we are really focused on five key unmet needs. So one is in we see in surgical oncology, which the space is really evolving as we speak. Where we see more targeted interventions that using our combinations of approaches in terms of technologies may provide more minimum invasive outcomes for the patients in the long term. Second is really in the area of obesity and that is still a fast growing segment where we see a lot of opportunity. Especially as you start to think about more minimally invasive surgical procedures that produce outcomes similar or close to the surgical interventions today. I mentioned a select cardiovascular disease areas that we highlighted previously, and then obviously osteoarthritis and osteoporosis which offer many opportunities if you think about in terms of joints trauma and spine where we see interesting opportunities to get tuck-in deals that would help accelerate our growth. So, those are some areas that we\u2019re very focused staying on right now. When you say spaces that we\u2019re not in today, if you look at it, we are the largest most comprehensive medical device business with the footprint in surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular. We would obviously like to expand our cardiovascular footprint but we will do that in a strategic way where we can create some values. So there are very - lot of places that are nice adjacencies as I\u2019ve outlined that we think we can create some value through tuck-in deals more larger acquisition as well. Louise Mehrotra : Okay. Thanks very much. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Good morning. Dominic, I'm surprised that you're putting a buyback as a third priority ahead of M&A. If you look at your PE multiple today it's about 14, 15 times, well below your pharma peers as well as your med tech peers. You have a massively under leveraged balance sheet, one of the few AAA-rated balance sheets out there. Investors clearly have been frustrated by the operating performance and the stock performance. And I'm just curious to know, if you're so excited about the growth outlook of the business, what could be a better investment than you buying back your stock? But not $10 billion. What I'm talking about is something much more substantial that would really make an impact on your growth rate, like a leveraged buyback up to $50 billion or even higher. If you could talk about that a bit. And also, just back to the M&A discussion, I think there's a lot of focus on getting your MD&D business back to growth. Can you talk about your thoughts on, most of the med device growth assets out there are trading at multiples well ahead of yours, and how you think about generating value by potentially acquiring some of those? Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well Jami as you know, we\u2019ve been very consistent with our capital allocation strategy and that's based on extensive research over many years. As you know share buybacks have some incremental benefit but the data as you know is mixed on the overall outcome. And just because we did a $10 billion share buyback doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t do another one, another one and another one. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily limit it to just one that was announced today. Of course the big difference between M&A and share buybacks is the one thing that share buybacks don\u2019t do of course is they don\u2019t provide any incremental capability of the company, any incremental ability to innovate and be competitive in healthcare and that we places a priority over reducing the share count. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do both, I think we have the financial flexibility to do both and I think you will see us do both. As far as being under-levered, I think these go hand-in-hand. We want to maintain financial flexibility to do the kinds of transactions that we think are going to be value creating to shareholders when those opportunities arise. So we always maintain financial flexibility just as a simple way of the way we conduct our business. As far as getting back to growth in MD&D, through M&A and I'll obviously have Gary comment as well, when you talk about assets that seem to be highly valued, I think what's very important to realize is that none of the assets that are - that you may be referring is to highly valued has the scale and breadth of the kind of MD&D business that we have here at Johnson & Johnson. So our ability to leverage our scale and breadth, our scientific knowhow, our engineering knowhow, the overall presence in the hospital setting with contracting and the like is probably unparalleled and very few companies despite their current valuations have that built into their valuations and we think in our hands we can possibly create more value than the business on a standalone basis. Gary anything else do you want to add to that? Gary Pruden : No, listen I think Jami, that is a challenge we\u2019re taking on in medical device, right which is as many companies with really large portfolio we have a mix of platform performance versus the market right. We\u2019ve got strong performance leaders in segments in surgery, cardio and ortho, but also have some opportunities where we need to accelerate our growth right in platforms like spine, trauma, energy and infection prevention. I think we understand how to drive that growth in those areas in energy and infection prevention. We have a pipeline of new innovations which we think will accelerate our growth. In Spine and trauma we need to accelerate that pace of innovation through internal innovation and externally sourced innovations as well. So I think we will look at opportunities both organic and inorganic to accelerate our growth rate, to drive that performance because I think that will be critical and important to the long time growth of the business. As Dominic mentioned, with the scale of the business at $22 billion, right, accelerating our growth rate by one or two points is a very large acquisition, which any of those acquisition of that nature we would want to do that very carefully and ensure that we are creating shareholder value. Jami Rubin : Dominic, just if I can push back for a second, clearly the track record in buybacks, just given where stock price has been over the last 10 years have been mixed, but the track record with M&A has also been mixed, such as the Synthes deal which Gary talked about during his remarks. I'm just curious to know how you think about that. But thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : You're right. Not every M&A deal works out exactly the way you would predicted it would. I think we were very clear that we thought enhancing scale in orthopaedics was important and we did so at a time quite frankly was ahead of where you now see the competitive set doing. So I think we are very pleased having done that acquisition. We think of acquisitions as creating value over the long term and despite some market slow down we are still very confident in the growth of our overall orthopaedics business along with the trauma business that we acquired from Synthes just having the broader scale to create value. M&A can be tricky, we work very hard to do so and do the deals in a disciplined way and to gain value from these transactions over the long term. Jami Rubin : Thank you very much. A \u2013 Dominic Caruso : You're welcome. Louise Mehrotra : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Damien Conover : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two drug related questions. One question on XARELTO Still some pretty strong growth there but it seems like a little bit of a deceleration. I wasn't sure if some new indications are really needed to reaccelerate that growth. I know there's a couple coming up in heart failure and stroke over the next couple years. And then the second question was just on REMICADE. It looked like some declines there internationally, partly due to Japan. But I was also wondering if you could give any insights on what you're seeing in the European area with biosimilars. Thank you. Gary Pruden : Sure, let me just say a few words on XARELTO. You may be referring to a little bit of slow down sequentially with XARELTO. I think that dynamic has to do with the donut hole that\u2019s part of the affordable care act in terms of Part D reimbursement. So as it turns out, when people with Part D coverage reach the donut hole amount, they have more out of pocket cost to incur. We believe that's had a bit of an impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and that wouldn\u2019t be necessarily just for our product. It would be seen across other products as well. Louise anything else to add? Louise Mehrotra : Yes. And in addition, so over half of our sales are in Medicare Part D and as you enter the donut hole, the manufacturers out there actually pickup the portion number of the pricing by 50%. So we are seeing that impact. Regarding REMICADE in Europe we are going to leave that Merck's to cover. A \u2013 Dominic Caruso : I do think that although we won\u2019t comment on Merck's territory, we do have REMICADE in Canada and we have seen a very little biosimilar impact there. We still are retaining about 90% of the business and again as we have said before, these are biosimilar and not generics and there is a lot that goes into physician's decision to switch a patient and as we have said many times before also, about 70% of the patients with REMICADE seem to be well controlled with their disease. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask you about emerging markets. Your comments were a little bit more temper than your prior comments. So I am wondering first if you could give us growth in emerging markets in the quarter? Louise Mehrotra : The emerging markets grew by 4% in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis they grew by 5%. Because there is some fluctuations between some of the tender business, et cetera in the emerging markets particularly Brazil and Russia. You're probably better to use the year-to-date numbers it\u2019s about 5% year-to-date operationally. Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford : Okay. And I realized you mentioned the lower inventory in China on the ortho side but are you seeing the softness in emerging markets more in devices or consumers? Dominic Caruso : I think it\u2019s very different dynamics in the emerging markets for consumers. So, for example the OTC businesses just as an example in Russia, we\u2019re doing extremely well in emerging markets, in that emerging markets with our consumer business. Whereas in China, as you know we\u2019ve had some issues there so we\u2019ve seen some slower growth in the China emerging markets. In Medical Devices as Gary pointed out, that\u2019s typically a robust market for us in Medical Devices. It\u2019s our largest of the three businesses in emerging markets and in China in particular as Medical Devices and just particularly this quarter we had the inventory contraction that we saw from our distributors as the market has slowed down in China. So we think that\u2019s sort of a one-time adjustment that we\u2019ve just experienced this quarter. Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford : Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Gary you take that. Gary Pruden : I look by splits the business from our surgical business to orthopaedics business, I look at China as a surrogate marker. Surgical business you still see good double-digit growth rates coming into the business. The realignment of issues in orthopaedics certainly offset that, same in Brazil we still see strong high single-digit, double-digit growth coming out of the surgery business but not so much in the ortho business due to the registration issues. So as in my comments in medical device it is slowed without question we\u2019ve seen that but again access to care growth is still growing, raising the standard in the market in terms of the medical unmet needs is still an opportunity and we still see good growth coming there albeit tempered from what it was maybe over the last 18 months. Louise Mehrotra : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeff Holford : Good morning. Thanks very much. I've got two questions. The first one is around INVOKANA where IMS volumes seem to have really flattened off since the FDA notice on ketoacidosis in May. Can you just talk about the product's recent performance in the US, and what is driving this, and when you hope to see an improvement or address any of those concerns that might be out there? And then the second question is really just going back to some the M&A discussion that's been on the call. I think in the past, Dominic, you said a few times that large-scale M&A in pharma or biopharma is in the opposite direction from what you've always thought about. Is that still the case going forward, so we can probably take from that the way you talk about the ability to still do larger deals, that's most likely to be in the MD&D - Dominic Caruso : Yes. Jason you broke up but I \u2013 Jeff you broke up but I think I understand where you were going. Let me just take the M&A question first and then Louise you could actually provide some color on INVOKANA. So Jeff I don\u2019t think you should read into the fact that we\u2019re adverse to doing large M&A in any of the businesses, it just has to be value creating as I have said many, many times. When I say it is in the opposite direction of our pharma strategies you know, our pharma strategy which has been very successful has not been driven by large M&A in comparison to what you\u2019ve seen in the industry and so we\u2019re very clear that growing the business through searching for the best compound, the best innovation regardless of where it comes from and then incorporating that into our development engine and using the scientific expertise that we have in house is what has been a success story of pharma that doesn't mean it can also happen with the large M&A deal but it has been consistently very, very capital efficient and very successful in the way we\u2019ve been doing it for the last couple of years. In terms of INVOKANA for ketoacidosis, you're right there was an FDA notice and it wasn\u2019t solely related to INVOKANA and our clinical trials for INVOKANA ketoacidosis rate was very, very low. But Louise any other comments on that? Louise Mehrotra : So Jeff I would like to point out that INVOKNANA did grow 91% in the quarter in U.S. I think that's pretty good. The markets consistently are growing about 7% I just looked at the trends and it\u2019s very consistent for second and third quarter. As far as TRx's, we\u2019re at 6.3% up from 6% in the second quarter, primary care is at 5.6% up from 5.3% and the endo at 13.1% is about the same as it was in the second quarter. So I think it\u2019s doing very well. Jeff Holford : Just as a follow-up, what I'm really referring to, when you look at the IMS data over the last two quarters or six months, there is a clear flattening off. Are you getting any feedback as to why that may be? I'm not talking about the year-on-year growth which is obviously very strong because the product's had a very strong ramp, but very much just the recent performance and what you're seeing there. Louise Mehrotra : To give you sequential TRxs, so I think that's the most recent that we would have, and I'm also looking at the market growth for that is at 7%. So I think we're doing fine. And as Dominic said, it's a very low incident. It's 0.01 or 0.1 in our Phase III trials. So it\u2019s very low. Jeff Holford : Okay. Great. Thank you. Louise Mehrotra : Next question? Operator : And your next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay? Louise Mehrotra : Yes. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Bob. Good morning Bob Hopkins : Thanks and good morning. Gary, since we have you on the call I just have two quick questions for you. The first is a follow-up on the robotics side. I was just wondering if you can give us an indication of what announcement we're going to hear over the next couple of weeks. And then if you could also just give us a sense as to where you are with this collaboration with Google. You said it's in the development stage. Could you just give us some rough parameters of how you're thinking about commercialization? Is this one to two years? Two to three? Three to five? Just some rough sense there would be helpful. Thanks. Gary Pruden : Thanks, Bob. So in terms of robotics, listen, I will leave the announcement to the new co of the company. They have some announcements that will be coming out in the next few weeks, so I'd like to leave the leader there to do it. As mentioned this is a partnership between ourselves and my partner, Andy Conrad at Google Life Sciences, so new company will make that announcement. In terms of the development stage, yes, we were in the phase where we are integrating right, our technology with the Google technology, right, in terms of from a systems engineering perspective, integrating informatics into the design of our robot. So we are looking, I would say you're on the earlier side of your range, right. I would say it's the next couple years. We'd obviously like to accelerate that, but we want to make sure that we stay true to our value proposition, which is we think what's available today is really the model that's more like the mainframe computer 50 years ago. We intend to go to the iPad version and that's what we want to launch. With a more integrated informatics diagnostics, right, that are available for the surgeon around the world as a lower cost to serve. So we think that it's better to do it right. There will be a lot of follow-on competitors that come in the next couple years that I think will be more big box players. That is clearly not our strategy. And we think this is an opportunity to be disruptive in a very unique partnership to create value for our customers, patients and also for the Johnson & Johnson shareholders. Louise Mehrotra : Last and final question and then we'll have some final remarks by Dominic. Operator : Thank you. Your final question is from Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to, Gary, echo one of Bob's questions and that is simply around robotics. I'm very respectful of the reduced cost to serve. But the real question becomes in the end game outside of the intellectual capital the two companies put together and come up with a fix. The question really becomes is there enough capacity for capital expense from the customers in the future, as you alluded to earlier most of the big boxes are really in developed markets. But if you think about this globally which I'm sure you are, then the question becomes is there sufficient capital at institutions today, especially in China, et cetera, that can actually deploy a robotics technology in the future? And my last question really, Dominic, is back to M&A again, sorry. But it \u2013 I actually - you alluded to pharma and the partnerships you've created have been great. I think I actually would have assumed that the speed which those partnerships would occur would actually escalate in part because of your capital that you currently have, and because the landscape is changing, certainly especially true in oncology? Any commentary would be great? Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Robotics? Gary Pruden : Yes. So thank you for the question. And listen, I think that question is an age old question that goes on which is, will there be enough capital to support innovation? I think the end of the day the answer is always yes. The other thing that I'll point out is, we don't believe that capital play here for our innovation is going to be $2 million per hospital. So we're going to provide a lot more flexibility in terms of that and also quite frankly depends on our go-to-market model, right, in terms of how we bring that to market. So I think you might find some unique ways in order to do that. We haven't quite decided on that at this point. But as mentioned we have decided in terms of our value proposition which will be a lower cost to serve, a smaller footprint and we do believe that if you produced innovation, right, that delivers meaningful outcomes and improvement for patients, there will be enough capital out there globally to support that. Dominic Caruso : Tony, with respect to M&A and pharma and your comment about the speed at which we can do partnerships and maybe you thought we would accelerate them, we're always actively involved in this space, not only in oncology, but in all the therapeutic areas that we operate in. And as you know we already have a pretty robust pipeline where we're going to be filing 10 new NMEs between now and 2015, some of those of course come from the various partnerships and licenses that we've done. So you'll continue to see us do that. I think accelerating those is something we always love to do, but we want to do the right deal with the right partner at the right value and getting the deal done right is probably more important. Tony Butler : Okay. Thanks, Dominic. Thanks, Gary. Dominic Caruso : Sure. You're welcome, Tony. Well, thanks everyone for tuning in today. Thanks, Louise and thanks, Gary, for giving us an update on our medical device business and strategies to accelerate growth. I'd just like to reiterate we're very pleased that we're able to announce a $10 billion share buyback program while we continue to actively look to put our financial strength to use to further accelerate our growth. So thanks again for tuning in today and have a very nice day. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

If you experience technical difficulties during the conference, you may press star zero to reach the operator. I would now like to turn conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. And it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks Alex will comment on 2015 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. During the review non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide lists the acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today's presentations. Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 2.4% versus fourth quarter of 2014. On an operational basis sales were up 4.4% and currency had a negative impact of 6.8%. In the U.S. sales were up 8%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 12.9%. On an operational basis the western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew 2.8%, while the Asia-Pacific Africa region grew 0.9% and Europe grew 0.8%. Growth in all regions was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the Cordis business with Europe, Latin America and Canada also negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was 7.8% worldwide, 13.4% in the U.S., and 2.9% outside the U.S. I'd like to point out that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, we did not achieve a full week of sales. However, we did have a few more shipping days. These additional shipping days added approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S. While these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the bottom line impact was negligible. Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $3.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.15, versus $0.89 a year ago. As referenced in the tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $220 million and a net charge of $608 million for after tax special items. 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $275 million and a charge of approximately $1.1 billion for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 4% and 5.1% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12.4%. Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2015. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2015 were $70.1 billion, a decrease of 5.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis sales grew 1.8% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 7.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 6.5% worldwide, 10.6% in the U.S., and 3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. 2015 annual net earnings were $15.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.48. For the year 2015 adjusted net earnings were $17.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.20, down 4.8% and 3% respectively versus the 2014 results. On an operational basis adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. Estimated free cash flow for the year was strong at $15.9 billion, up $1.1 billion versus 2014. Turning now to quarterly business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 1.8% with U.S. sales down 4.9%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 5.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 4.7% worldwide, 1.7% in the U.S., and 6.3% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by worldwide OTC and oral care as well as women's health outside the U.S. OTC sales results in the U.S. were driven by Zyrtec and product relaunches for digestive health products. Strong growth for analgesics was partially offset by timing of inventory builds, as noted in the third quarter, and a slower start to the flu season. In the U.S. adult analgesic market share was approximately 13.5%, up from approximately 11.5% a year ago. While U.S. pediatric share was approximately 45.5%, up from approximately 42% a year ago. Results outside the U.S. were driven by strong sales of upper respiratory products and the relaunch of anti-smoking products. Strong sales momentum, driven by successful marketing campaigns and geographic expansion for new products, drove results for LISTERINE in oral care and in women's health products outside the U.S. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 6.5% with U.S. sales up 12.7% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.9%. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 11.1% worldwide and 21% in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. declined approximately 0.2% with strong growth of new and core products, offset primarily by lower sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI to our distribution partner. Important contributors to growth were STELARA, INVOKANA and VOCAMET, IMBRUVICA, INVEGA, SUSTENNA and XEPLION, XARELTO and U.S. sales of REMICADE. STELARA achieved strong growth across all the major regions, driven by robust market growth and increased penetration with the psoriatic arthritis indication. Strong momentum in market share drove results for INVOKANA and VOCAMET. In the U.S. INVOKANA and VOCAMET achieved 6.5% total prescription share, or TRx, within the defined market of type II diabetes, excluding insulin and Metformin, up from 4.2% last year. TRx with endocrinologists was 12.8% for the quarter and 5.8% in primary care. Strong patient uptake with demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regiment share in second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S. results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake and shared momentum. IMBRUVICA is now approved in over 60 countries. As an update on our oncology pipeline, we received FDA approval for DARZALEX in November. DARZALEX is off to a robust start, with strong underlying market demand. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results in all major regions, primarily due to increased market share and the launch earlier this year of INVEGA TRINZA. Continued share growth drove XARELTO sales results with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 16.1%, up nearly 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. REMICADE in the U.S. benefited from strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share. REMICADE U.S. export sales and international sales were negatively impacted by lower distribution partner sales, due to the weakening of the Euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe, partially offset by a higher inventory reduction last year. Strong results were achieved in the western hemisphere excluding the U.S. I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. As a reminder we announced last week that we will use a new format for the reporting of sales in the Medical Devices segment. And we provided historical sales results in the new format at that time. The historical sales are available on our website. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 3.4%. U.S. sales increased 6.7%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 5.8% worldwide with the U.S. up 8% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by surgery, orthopedics, electrophysiology, and vision care, partially offset by the divestiture of the Cordis business. Growth in our surgery business was driven by strong results for the advanced products, with endocutters growth of 15%, biosurgicals growth of 9%, and energy growth of 5%. In addition, ASP and Mentor products in our specialty products made significant contributions to sales in the quarter. Market growth, additional selling days, and new products drove strong results for the U.S. orthopedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The successful introduction in early 2015 of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the success of the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips, and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC in spine or other made important contributions to the results. Orthopedic sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China, due to softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Spine, other and trauma were the categories most impacted. Our electrophysiology business grew 19% worldwide, due to strong market growth complemented by the success of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter. Vision care results were driven by very strong growth in the U.S. due to the introduction of new products as well as the trade inventory build. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2015. For your reference there were some notable developments in the fourth quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2015, on our website you will find annual sales highlights by segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Louise. Let me start by saying how optimistic and confident I am as we enter 2016. We had a strong finish to 2015. And with our healthy balance sheet we are well positioned to continue to invest for future growth. Our core business is very strong. And we expect a number of additional new products and line extensions in the coming year. Now as we enter 2016, we look forward to, first, continued growth of core products across our segments. Next, a rich near-term pipeline in our Pharmaceutical segment. Positive momentum in our Consumer segment with a full portfolio of OTCs back on the market. Setting a strong foundation for sustainable growth with the bold actions we are taking in our Medical Devices segment. And continued financial strength and strong free cash flows to return capital to shareholders and take disciplined and decisive actions regarding M&A that contribute to sustainable growth and long-term value creation. Now I'll share more specifics in my discussion with you today about the healthcare environment, our 2015 results, and why we're so optimistic and confident about the future for the enterprise in each of our business segments. But with that as a backdrop I'd like to begin where I always do by talking about our credo. Our credo is the beginning of everything at Johnson & Johnson. It guides all of our decisions. And I believe it sets us apart. This year is Johnson & Johnson's 130th year. Think of that for a moment. 130 years of working to balance our mission of helping people everywhere live longer, healthier, and happier lives. And I'm proud to see the employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world continuing to uphold the imperatives of our credo every day, through both our philanthropy initiatives, as recent commitment to supporting the immediate and ongoing needs of Syrian refugees in partnership with Save the Children, as well as through our commitments to the healthcare community with investments that will accelerate how we address global health crises like Ebola, AIDS, and mental health. You've undoubtedly heard me say that I believe healthcare is one of society's greatest challenges. And this global challenge grows with aging populations, rising costs in developed world, and growing middle classes in emerging economies who have increasing expectations for access to quality care. Now as the world's largest and most broadly based healthcare company, it's not just an opportunity for us to help manage this transformation, it is our responsibility to help lead the way to a better future. Now in this environment, ensuring access to important medicines and medical procedures remains a key objective for us. As government officials, politicians, and other stakeholders debate significant issues around the world, we're pleased to see that healthcare is such a focus in the dialogue. And we believe that our goals and those of public policy makers are aligned to find the best ways to ensure the delivery of quality healthcare and the best patient outcomes in a high-quality and sustainable manner. Now in this discussion it's the responsibility of all stakeholders to consider the economic and financial implications of healthcare. We got to look at the whole picture, drugs, devices, insurers, hospitals, and governments, put the patient in the center and reward innovations that drive better outcomes. Here in the United States, prescription drugs represent approximately 12% of total healthcare costs and medical devices represent around 6%. These cures and treatments not only improve quality of life for many patients, extend life for others, and contribute to the productivity of our society, but they can also help to reduce caregiver burden, disability, and healthcare spending overall. The promise of innovation in healthcare is great and will remain great if we can take a holistic approach to reforming the healthcare system. At Johnson & Johnson we believe in this holistic approach to healthcare solutions. It's vital to developing the best innovations, to meeting the needs of our stakeholders, and to sustaining our legacy of strong and consistent business performance. Our Consumer, Medical Devices, and Pharmaceutical segments are increasingly interconnected businesses. And we believe that being broadly based in healthcare has been and will continue to be a significant factor in Johnson & Johnson's success, as it positions us well to lead and grow our business with the evolving healthcare landscape. Our broad global footprint enables us to reach more patients and consumers in fast-developing and changing markets. In fact, Johnson & Johnson is operating in 60 countries today. And we are continuing to invest in implementing new operating models, forging strong relationships with local governments and health systems, and further accelerating growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships with local companies. Because of our broad base across healthcare, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice. Now let me just go over a few examples. With large health systems, we are taking more of a business-to-business model to help them with innovative contracting strategies, integrated services and solutions, and with dedicated customer-focused teams. We're working with technology companies like Google, IBM, and Apple, who are advancing medical innovation through an infusion of technology that can benefit from deep healthcare expertise Johnson & Johnson can uniquely provide. We're continuing to support biotech and med tech start-ups who appreciate the value we placed on innovation and the reach and breadth of our footprint in the healthcare market. And with public health organizations we have a tremendous opportunity to address the gaps that remain in innovation, access, and delivery of effective prevention and treatment. We're collaborating more than ever before to meet the world's most pressing public health challenges. Our scale, financial flexibility, and business and healthcare expertise make Johnson & Johnson a key partner for a number of our stakeholders. And our relationships with these partners will help Johnson & Johnson continue to be a leader in the future. Applying our expertise in design thinking, strategic innovation models, and a commitment to collaborating with all stakeholders, we've developed a number of cross-segment innovations. For example, we've created the China Lung Cancer Center, which is developing a holistic approach to treat lung cancer in China, where the disease is particularly prevalent. We're pioneering cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration, combining technologies from Pharma and from our vision business to find a way to address this condition. And we're leveraging capabilities from our Medical Devices, Pharma, and Consumer businesses to treat obesity and diabetes in new ways. In fact, almost every one of our programs can benefit from the advantages of our broad base. Over the past several years, we've also been leveraging our scale by developing enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our sectors, targeting as much as $1 billion in operational savings by 2018 to support our growth. And we believe innovation that is taking place within our supply chain and quality systems is actually creating a competitive advantage for Johnson & Johnson. But the bottom line \u2013 well, it's the bottom line. And this broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent, and sustainable financial performance. Let's consider some of the numbers. First, 53 consecutive years of dividend increases at Johnson & Johnson. That means we have provided steady dividend increases since we first put a man in space. And 32 years of consecutive adjusted operational earnings growth, more than three decades. Over the past 10 years we have returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And today, 70% of our revenues come from brands that are number one or number two in their markets. We have 24 brands that represent $1 billion platforms. If you think about that, in 1999 the entire corporation had revenues of $24 billion. And about 25% of our sales come from brands launched in the last 5 years. That's a result of constant learning, collaboration, and innovation. Our corporate structure, our broad base, is a strategic choice and one that is grounded on performance, not just our heritage. We know it has been a significant driver in the past and expect it will be more important in the future. As we've said, we see global healthcare growing at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years. And we have a clear objective : that Johnson & Johnson should grow sales organically at a faster rate than the market. We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. In addition, we will continue to create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, and you are looking at a very compelling long-term total shareholder return. As part of our performance-driven strategy, we regularly review the structure and portfolio of our businesses to evaluate how they're delivering on our responsibilities to the stakeholders outlined in our credo, meeting evolving healthcare needs, and achieving performance expectations. Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous and disciplined portfolio review program focused on creating long-term shareholder value. And this applies to all our businesses. We have a track record of evolving our business and taking decisive actions when necessary to meet changing industry and consumer dynamics. And we'll continue to do so in the future. We're actively looking for the right opportunities to create greater value for our shareholders. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner. But we're also patient. We will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price and with the right partners. Now historically, about half of our growth has come from M&A and half from internal development, which we fully expect to continue. And with our strong balance sheet, we've got the resources to do just that. Now let me take a few minutes to review the priorities we laid out for you last year. One, we will continue to be focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Two, in Pharmaceuticals, our objective as always is constant innovation. We're building on our launch excellence and continuing to develop a robust pipeline of transformational medicines. In our Consumer business, we positioned our entire portfolio to focus on key geographies, need states, and mega brands. We are prioritizing and investing to expand our market leadership in key Consumer segments in OTC, oral care, baby, and beauty. And as you heard through our announcement last week, our priority in Medical Devices is accelerating growth through the strategic investments in innovation and by transforming our go-to-market models. We're confident that these priorities will deliver the results that you expect from us and, just as importantly the results that we expect from ourselves. As we said we are pleased with our 2015 performance. In 2015 we generated sales of $70.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth across our enterprise. Our in-market portfolio in Pharmaceuticals delivered strong growth. We built positive momentum in our Consumer segment. And we just announced bold actions to accelerate growth in our Medical Devices segment. Throughout the year you've heard from each of our business segment leaders about the strategies we put in place to meet our commitments. So I'll touch on just a few of the recent actions we've taken to advance those strategies. As Joaquin Duato laid out for you at our Pharmaceuticals business review in May, our Pharmaceuticals business has a clear strategy focused on five therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine, and proven commercial capabilities. Joaquin talked to you about how we're investing in our future with 10 new products we plan to file by 2019, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in annual sales. And in fact, we are already delivering one of those promising medicines to the market, 4 months ahead of schedule, with the U.S. approval for DARZALEX, the first human monoclonal antibody to be approved anywhere in the world for patients with multiple myeloma, which is off to a very good start. In the near term I know many of you are keeping an eye on potential biosimilar competition in the United States. As you've heard us say, biosimilars are not generics. With more than 2.4 million people having been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients receiving sustained and effective treatment, we believe doctors will be reluctant to switch them off with that level of success. And we've seen this play out in many markets where biosimilars have already been introduced. And we also have a patent for REMICADE that expires in September 2018 that we'll obviously continue to vigorously defend. We consider our immunology products part of an important and robust portfolio for patients, physicians, and payers. So when you consider our continued expectations for REMICADE, as well as the future potential of products like STELARA and SIMPONI and the pending submissions of Guselkumab and Sirukumab, we are confident in our ability to continue driving strong growth from our immunology portfolio. When you combine these advances with additional line extension approvals expected in 2016, like those for IMBRUVICA, STELARA, and INVOKANA and DARZALEX, approval in the EU, our near-term pipeline is incredibly robust and may not be fully appreciated in the market. With the combined strength of our in-market portfolio and deep, late-stage pipeline we expect to deliver above industry compound average growth through 2019. Our consumer expertise, insight, and access are becoming increasingly valuable to payers and providers, as demographic and technology trends in healthcare are moving the system toward more consumer-driven decision-making and in some cases, self-care alternatives. We see this as a key differentiator for our company. And we are investing in technologies that help us exploit this expertise across our broad base. Jorge Mesquita and our other Consumer business leaders will share more details at our Consumer business review this May. For 2015 our U.S. OTC business continued to grow faster than the market. And we're happy to report that nearly all of our OTC products have returned to shelves. And we are proud the quality system improvements we have put into place. Our Consumer Medical Device businesses, the Johnson & Johnson diabetes solutions companies and Johnson & Johnson vision care, made progress in 2015 to improve our competitiveness. Both businesses, which command global leadership positions in their respective categories, focused their 2015 turnarounds on launching new products, solidifying their base businesses, and accelerating growth. And both businesses have regained or stabilized market share and market leadership and introduced important new products, such as Animas Vibe and ACUVUE OASYS 1-DAY with HydraLuxe in the U.S. In our broader Medical Device businesses, last week we announced a strategic restructuring initiative designed to directly support and accelerate the strategy Gary Pruden laid out for you on our third quarter earnings call. We are reallocating resources to priority platforms like endocutters, knees, trauma, and EP. And recent history shows that when we double down in an area, we are able to accelerate meaningful innovation and outcomes, as we saw with our endocutters portfolio, which is now the fastest growing platform in our Medical Devices segment. Additionally, we are making progress on transforming our go-to-market models, like our cross-selling efforts between Ethicon and DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction and Spine, which resulted in over 600 leads through 2015. We are now co-selling in over 1,200 accounts. And all sales teams will be trained covering all markets by the end of the first quarter. And finally, our recent acquisition of Coherex Medical in the area of atrial fibrillation and the surgical robotics collaboration with Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, are examples of the type of focused and strategic investments that you will see us make more of in the future. Our goal is to reach more patients, outperform the markets in which we compete, and consistently identify, build, and acquire new platforms for growth. Moving forward into 2016 we will continue to take bold but appropriate steps to put our Medical Device business in the best position to deliver more value for customers and for our company and for our shareholders. In summary we believe that improved universal access to quality healthcare, rewarding innovation, and a more vital culture of health, wellness, and prevention are the keys to a future where people are healthier and businesses and economies are stronger. Our broad-based experience and scale uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the movement towards outcomes and episodes of care-based approaches and ultimately a healthier society. We're optimistic about the future opportunities in healthcare and confident in the strength of our business. In 2016 we will remain focused on our near term priorities and continue to advance our longer term growth drivers, enabling us to continue delivering shareholder value year after year. With the guidance of our credo we'll continue to meet our responsibilities to all stakeholders. That's been true for 129 years of breakthrough, life-saving innovation. And we are confident Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to continue meeting those responsibilities for the next 130 years. Thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for 2016. Dominic? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard from Alex, we're very pleased with our 2015 performance. We believe we managed our business well and have provided you insights during the year in a transparent manner that allowed all of you to understand our plans and expectations. We finished the year strong, and we're carrying that momentum into 2016. We ended the year at the top end of our operational guidance range for both sales and earnings and exceeded estimates for earnings as published by [Thomson] First Call. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed, consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2015. I'd first like to remind you about some of the key assumptions in our guidance for 2015. At the beginning of the year we discussed that while we reinvested some of the profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments, making 2015 comparisons to 2014 results more challenging. Additionally, currency headwinds increased quite substantially in 2015, negatively impacting both sales and earnings for 2015 by approximately 8%. Given those expected headwinds, last January we guided that we would deliver operational sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. As you can see, while reported sales results show a decrease of 5.7%, on an operational basis we ended up at the high end of our guidance with operational sales growth at 1.8%. We also provided you with an estimate of our underlying operational sales growth for 2015, which excluded the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C sales. We expected that underlying operational growth would be approximately 6%. And we exceeded that estimate, delivering 6.5%. On earnings our adjusted operational EPS growth in our original 2015 guidance was expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. As reported this morning our EPS of $6.20 reflects operational growth of 5.8% and is at the top of the updated EPS guidance range we gave in October. And finally, our adjusted net income margin improved to 24.9%. Now let's take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide you can see our condensed, consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we expected, direct comparisons to our fourth quarter of 2014 would be challenging, due to stronger OLYSIO sales that we benefited from last year, as well as divestitures and currency headwinds in 2015. Our results on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep-C sales, were up 7.8% for the quarter. As Louise noted, sales did benefit from additional shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2015. Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4 billion in the quarter, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, versus $1.37 a year ago, are up 5.1%. And the adjusted EPS result exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. Excluding the impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.54, or up 12.4% for the fourth quarter. In the quarter we incurred intangible amortization expense of $200 million on an after tax basis, as well as after tax special charges of $600 million, which included an expense of $400 million related to the restructuring of our Medical Device business, which we announced last week, and in-process research and development charge of $200 million. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points lower than the same period last year, impacted by changes in our business and product mix. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses were 33.1% of sales. This is 120 basis points higher than last year, as we continued to invest to drive growth in our key brands. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 16.1% in the quarter and 170 basis points higher than the prior year, as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. In fact, in the fourth quarter we entered into important new licensing agreements, made milestone payments, and increased spending to advance our R&D portfolio, which are all positive developments, as we continue to strengthen our pipeline. Interest expense net of interest income was slightly lower, reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter, compared to a net charge of approximately $1 billion in the same period last year. Of course this line item includes several special items in both years. Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, compared to a net gain of approximately $130 million in the prior year period. This year's fourth quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestiture of Cordis. As a reminder we indicated that any gains from divestitures, which are reflected in the other income and expense line, would largely be reinvested in the business, as well as used to mitigate the negative impact of currency and a lower level of income in 2015 from reduced OLYSIO sales. And therefore, our pre-tax operating margin would be expected to be lower in 2015 versus 2014. And our 2015 results reflect just that. We funded important investments with a higher level of other income that will benefit us going forward. The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2015 was 17.7%. This was lower than the rate in the previous 9 months due to the passing of legislation, which renewed the R&D tax credit and look-through provisions. The R&D tax credit and look-through provisions were always included in our annual guidance. The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.7%, slightly below guidance due to the mix of income from higher to lower tax jurisdictions. Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Adjusted income before tax for the entire enterprise improved from 30.7% of sales in 2014 to 31.4% of sales in 2015. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment. Medical Devices expanded 360 basis points, due primarily to the gain associated with the Cordis divestiture. While Pharmaceutical margins contracted 50 basis points, due to the lower OLYSIO sales and increased investments in research and development, partially offset by the gain earlier in the year of divestiture of NUCYNTA. Consumer margins contracted 110 basis points, due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014, as well as important investments for future growth, as we returned our iconic Consumer brands to the market. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider, as you refine your models for 2016. Before I discuss sales and earnings I'll first give you some guidance on items we know may be difficult to forecast. I would first like to address our cash position and remind you about our capital allocation approach. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $18.5 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $38.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt. This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold. And as Alex said earlier, we are actively looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders. But we are patient. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner. And we'll only act when we see the right value creating deal at the right price with the right partners. We have a transparent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with dividends to our shareholders, followed by value-creating M&A. And then we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders, such as share repurchase programs. And due to our strong balance sheet, we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute on all three of these capital allocation priorities simultaneously. During Q4 2015 we used approximately $1 billion to repurchase shares of our stock in connection with our $10 billion share repurchase program that we announced in October. Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2016 net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as divestitures, asset sales, and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Although we expect to have a significantly lower level of other income in 2016 versus 2015, our pre-tax operating margin in 2016 is expected to expand by more than 200 basis points. As we've discussed several times during the year, we continue to evaluate our portfolio. And we expected that any gains from divestitures would be lower than the level we saw in 2015. However, we also discussed that we would nonetheless improve on earnings, as we see the benefits of good expense management and meaningful investments we made in 2015. And now a word on taxes. We're very pleased that the R&D tax credit was made permanent and approved by Congress this last year. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 19.5% to 20.5%. Turning to sales and earnings guidance. Our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business. And we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. And we'll also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. For the full year 2016 we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our 2015 operator sales growth excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hep-C sales, was approximately 6.5%. After adjusting for extra shipping days in 2015, that underlying growth rate was approximately 5.5% in 2015. Our sales guidance for 2016 on the same basis is expected to continue at a similar growth rate of around 5.5%. While the euro has been fairly stable over the last few months, many of the other currencies have been volatile. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro at $1.09, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1.5%. We are watching the other currencies closely, as it is uncertain as to how they will settle out for the year. Of course we will update the assessment as we progress throughout the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1% to 2% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. Now turning to earnings. A continuing factor impacting earnings guidance for 2016 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which although hedged, is still somewhat negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 60 basis points to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%. Again we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at $1.09, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early stage in the year we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which at approximately 5% is higher than current consensus estimates. So in summary as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I'd like to make a few points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 2.5% and 3.5%, we're pleased to note when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, our operational sales growth is expected to be around 5.5% for the full year 2016. With regards to expected EPS growth on an operational basis, our adjusted EPS growth guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 8%. Also for 2016 pre-tax operating margins are expected to expand by more than 200 basis points, based on the guidance I just provided. Margin expansion is driven by a combination of investments we made in 2015, coupled with the benefit of disciplined expense management across the enterprise. Moving into 2016 we are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute on our growth plans and near term priorities that Alex laid out for you this morning, we're well positioned with a strong balance sheet to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success. Our goal remains to grow our sales organically at a rate faster than the markets in which we compete, grow our earnings faster than sales, and create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All this coupled with our strong dividend yield provides a very compelling long-term shareholder return. Finally, before I turn it over to Louise for Q&A, just a reminder to please save the date for our Consumer and Medical Devices business review on Wednesday, May 18. Thank you. Now back to Louise. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Dominic. Manny, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. Okay. And your first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Mike. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the question. So let me start with the margin expansion piece of the guidance. And this kind of fits in with the announcement last week on the MD&D business. And there's really like \u2013 there's two parts to the question. So if I look at MD&D and where you ended up with pre-tax margins in 2015, they were at 35.6%. And which to every observer would say, those are very high margins. And for the overall company, you're guiding to 200 basis points plus of pre-tax margin improvement, which would make 2016 the biggest year of margin expansion in the last 15 years. So talk about the decision to be as aggressive as you're being in 2016 on operating costs. And for the MD&D business in particular, why is the consolidation that you're pursuing and let's call it the cost transformation imperative at this point in time? And why are you being as aggressive as you're being? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Mike, thanks for your question. Well, couple things. One is the \u2013 2015 as you saw was a heavy investment year, because we benefited from the divestitures. And I think we were very transparent that we would make important investments going into 2015. And we did just that. So in 2016 we have a lower level of those investments, consistent with a lower level of the other income that we just guided to. Also it's important to point out that those investments we made in 2015, we're seeing the benefits of those already in 2016. So we think they were wise investments. And finally, we've talked a lot about our various programs of reducing our cost structure. And Alex today mentioned the program that we embarked on several years ago that will reduce cost by $1 billion by 2018. Well we're well on our way in implementing that program after several years of investment. In 2016 we'll see a year where the actual benefits associated with that program outweigh any incremental investments. And maybe \u2013 Alex, maybe a comment on the MD&D restructuring, and why that's appropriate for us to do today. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Mike. We do think that this is the right time to be making the moves. But really I think it's important to kind of step back and put it into larger perspective. If you think about what we've been doing in Medical Devices over the last several years, we've had a range of activities, ranging from some of the divestitures with OCD as well as Cordis underway. At the same time, we've been making changes internally with the way that our organizations are innovating as well as in the way that they're going to market. And so we see this as the next logical step in that overall process. Our Medical Devices business is one that we remain very committed to. We believe that it's got an exciting future, a lot of new innovation coming, new ways of dealing with our customers. And so we think this is the right time to make sure that we're set up for growth, not only in 2016 but actually for the next 5 years and 10 years. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Dominic, can you share any commentary about how you're thinking about the respective businesses in 2016 versus your 2015 performance? And then maybe just on the MD&D topic, it's hard to piece out what the kind of underlying growth is with the extra selling days. But MD&D did grow 5.8% this quarter. That's obviously inflated by that. Do you have any thoughts just in terms of where you are in the turn of the performance in the MD&D business? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Well sure, Michael. Let me comment overall. As you know, our growth in 2015, primarily driven by Pharmaceuticals. And we expect healthy growth in 2016 from Pharma, but probably at a slightly lower rate of growth than what we saw in 2015 as those products that we launched are beginning to mature in their growth trajectory, but still a lot of growth ahead of them. So we're not going to give guidance by sector. But overall a little bit lower growth in 2016 versus 2015 for Pharma. Better growth in Consumer, good momentum in 2015 carrying on into 2016. And we expect higher growth rates in 2016 versus 2015 for the Medical Devices business as well. And as you saw, we ended the year with good, strong momentum in that business as well. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. I'll let some others jump in. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Question for Alex. Alex, given the strong balance sheet, I'm somewhat surprised you were not more aggressive with the balance sheet in 2015, especially on the M&A front. And you made some comments about the balance sheet going forward. But I'm just curious. As you evaluate your options, particularly on the M&A front, is the fact that we haven't seen deals year to date or so far, is it because the targets still have very high valuation expectations? Or is it that most of your cash is trapped outside the U.S., limiting your ability to do acquisitions? Or is it a little bit of both? Thanks. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Glenn, thank you very much for your question. Look, we are and we have been and will continue to be very active in the M&A category. As we mentioned during the earlier comments, if you look at us historically, really over about any timeframe, 20 years, 10 years, what you see is about half of our growth being generated from organic innovation platforms and about 50% being generated vis-a-vis M&A. As we reflect back on 2015 we realize that the market was premium priced. We remained very active in a number of different areas. And while we didn't necessarily close on a larger deal, I would not assume that we were not engaged and involved. But at the same time, we think it's really important for you, our shareholders, as you think about long-term returns, that we stay at the appropriate level of discipline and decisiveness as we go through that process. As we look at the environment today, we see a number of opportunities across the Consumer, the Medical Devices, and the Pharmaceutical groups. We're going to remain very active. I think that our financial team has done a great job of using our offshore assets in a very compliant but also tax-effective way. And we'll continue to look for opportunities that ultimately we believe are going to help us continue to get into growing markets, to improve our share position, to provide complementary products and services to platforms that we already have, that ultimately are going to lead to long-term sustainable growth for J&J. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So if I hear you correctly, you're saying valuations were elevated for the targets in 2015. But I sense from you that the valuations of your targets, valuations are coming down. And it sounds like the cash sitting outside the U.S. will not inhibit deal flow. So is that a fair assumption? And then is there any one business versus the other that you would be more likely inclined to do an acquisition to help accelerate growth? Thanks. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Glenn, look, we're fortunate in that because of our strong performance, our strong cash flows, that our balance sheet is actually quite strong. I also believe that if you look at our track record of how we've utilized that cash to make the right capital investments in companies, that we've been successful with that. And look, we think that there's opportunities across all three of our different sectors. And it's not an algorithm per se as we decide which and where to invest, but rather it really depends on the opportunity. And many of the factors that Dominic described earlier, as far as what are the specific platforms that we're looking at? Where is the partner in terms of their decision making, what they want to do with the business? And frankly what the competitive environment is like? So we think that there are opportunities. We intend to be quite active as we look at 2016 and beyond in a manner that's been consistent with our track record in that area. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Alex. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question please? Next question please? Operator : Yes. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Matt. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. So one kind of broader question on the sort of changes in the health economy in the U.S. And then I have one follow-up on some of the extra day commentary that you made. So looking forward to the MD&D day and the update on sort of the restructuring there. But stepping back, you've been one of the leaders here in sort of broader contracting strategies and developments, some of these value added services like CareSense and Outpatient Solutions. Alex, it would be just helpful to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of uptake of those kinds of strategies. And maybe talk about whether we're in the early innings here? And how you think about some of the benefits you're seeing or hope to see with those approaches to the business? And then I have one follow-up. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, overall we feel that we're still in the very early innings of what I'd call is the market evolution that we clearly expect to see over the next 3 years, 5 years, and even 10 years. And for all the reasons that we've discussed around increasing demands based on demographics certainly here in the U.S., and a rising middle class in demographics outside the United States, and the pressure that that's likely going to put on payers and governments and others in between. We realize that there is an opportunity for us to participate, not only in bringing great innovation that's going to help patients, but also doing it in a value-added way. And clearly the consumer, the patient is weighing in much heavier in these decisions, as they take on higher co-pays, as they can get more information that's available online. And frankly they just have higher expectations about their ability to participate in that healthcare decision-making process. So what we see is a range of customers. Look, we see some customers who are still very innovation focused. And to be clear we remain very innovation focused. We think at the end of the day what we do best is bring new products, new solutions to our customers that are going to ultimately have better outcomes for patients. And so that's an area where we are very focused on and will continue to be focused on. We are though starting to also see hospital systems. And I think one important point here is it's certainly taking place in the United States. But it's also definitely taking place in places like Europe and even some of the developing and emerging markets that frankly don't have the history and the legacy of some of the infrastructure that you see in the more developed markets. And there it \u2013 what we see is an evolution more towards a business-to-business relationship, where, yes, customers want to see innovation. But they also want to see how are you going to interact? How can you assist in working with our supply chain to make it more efficient? How can we work together as part of a broader partnership that ultimately is focusing not just on a product sell, but actually on an outcome, on an episode of care for the patient. And it creates a much broader partnership. We are seeing those organizations becoming more and more interested. And that's why we're adapting to make sure that we're part of that. So I think overall it's a \u2013 it's important that we continue to innovate, we continue to operate with a lot of excellence in the current environment. At the same time it's important that we set the stage for this evolution that's taking place out there to make sure that we can not only be successful, but we'll actually be a leader as that market evolves as well. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Very, very helpful. And then the clarification on the extra shipping days as you talked about. It was a holiday week. And maybe OR surgery days were not as much of a factor as shipping days from what I could tell in your commentary. But you were strong in vision care, obviously a shipping type of business. Strong in Pharma. Just wondering, Dominic, if \u2013 or if you have any color on some of your consignment businesses, where we think about orthopedics, spine, and trauma, where the inventory is in the field, it's not on your balance sheet. Is it \u2013 was there any difference in the way those businesses were impacted, versus businesses where you're actually shipping and billing for things in the last couple days of the quarter? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Matt. Well, just overarching comment on this. Of course these extra shipping days were already included in our guidance for the year. And I think you've all modeled for them. And as you know our sales came in pretty much in line with expectations. About 1% for the year we think is the impact overall for the enterprise and about 4% in the quarter. You're right. It does vary slightly by different businesses within the U.S. in particular. So this is largely a U.S. phenomenon, as opposed to a global phenomenon. And with respect to the orthopedics business line, which I think you're referring to specifically, I think, Louise, you might have the details on the impact there. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. So the additional days in the U.S. in orthopedics was about 2.5 days, and outside the U.S. about 1.5-day average. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : So not really much different from the overall total, because that 2.5 days gets you to this 4% and 1% that I talked about earlier. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : It was interesting also, when you look at the underlying growth in the orthopedics third quarter, fourth quarter, taking out the additional shipping days, we saw sequential improvement across hips, knees, spine, and trauma. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : That's right. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : On a worldwide basis. Okay? Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific. Thanks. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Larry. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Let me just start with med tech, and then I had a follow-up on Pharma. So, Alex, can you talk about the health of the med tech end markets in the U.S. and emerging markets? And what drives the acceleration for your business specifically in 2016? When I look at the general surgery business, it looked like, adjusting for the extra days in the U.S., that was \u2013 or worldwide that was slightly weaker in Q4. So just the health of the end markets in the U.S. and emerging markets. And I had a follow-up. Thanks. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Larry. Look, I think what we would say overall is we continue to see let's say a slightly increasing positive trend. So we saw hospital admissions I believe up around 2%. We saw surgical procedures up a little over 1% in the U.S. That's the most recent data that we have. If we go outside the U.S. we think rates in Europe have been pretty steady. And even in the markets in which we compete most significantly in the developing markets, we haven't seen a major impact from secular shifts. Perhaps in China some but not dramatic. And then putting that into the context and what that represents overall on our business, we don't see it as a major indicator. As I look toward 2016, look, there's a few things that cause us to be optimistic about our Medical Device business. And it really starts with innovation. And we've got about 30 products that we'll be launching by the end of 2016. Over half of those have either been launched or are well on their way as we speak. And what we're seeing is when we're bringing new technology to the market like our new contact lenses, like our new insulin pump, like our new energy instrumentation, like the ATTUNE knee, we're seeing very good uptake. And in fact in those categories, we're seeing share gains. And certainly in areas like electrophysiology endocutters, the same thing. And so we believe that the market does still reward significant innovation when we're introducing it. So that's one aspect. The second aspect frankly is, one, just improved execution. And I think if you look across all of our device businesses, you think about diabetes care, the major price reset that we had there a couple of years ago. And as all of you know when you take that kind of a reduction, resizing your business, going back into each and every line, and setting it for the new marketplace causes a tremendous amount of change. If you look at our vision care business last year, we went in and we really increased the cadence out of our innovation pipeline, launching five new products. We did a price reset there to make us more competitive with the ECPs. We made a lot of other internal adjustments to improve our selling and marketing. We are definitely seeing the impact of that now, not only on the sales results of up 8%, but as, and maybe even more importantly, if you look at the leading indicators as far as new share that's being generated and new patient starts in the offices, those things are positive. Louise mentioned earlier the improvement that we're seeing across our orthopedics business. And look, this is one where we know that when you bring large organizations together, when you standardize quality systems, manufacturing systems, we think that we've made a lot of progress there. And frankly when you compound that with the innovation rollout that we've seen in orthopedics of the ATTUNE knee, the CORAIL hip, the TFNA nail, we're starting to see that come back. As well as some of the \u2013 frankly the new approaches that we're taking that Gary will be talking about more in May, where our Ethicon and our DePuy Synthes teams are actually co-selling, co-contracting in a number of very innovative ways. Compounded with the fact that, look, we think some of the performance issues related to China in our orthopedics are more of a one-time event. That's getting normalized. So as we burn our way through those and head into 2016 overall, we think that innovation, we think changes in our commercial model, we think improved execution, all those things are \u2013 make us more optimistic about the growth prospects as we head into 2016. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful, Alex. And I just had one follow-up on a biosimilar REMICADE. So obviously there's a panel scheduled \u2013 rescheduled next month. So wondering if you can talk about what issues you think we should be listening for? What your expectations are? And what you're seeing in Europe, where biosimilar REMICADE is on the market? And why or why not that might be a proxy for the U.S.? Thanks a lot. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly. Well obviously we'll also be watching the advisory committee and participating in it as well coming up. And we think there's a few things to keep in consideration about this. And first and foremost is that as Dominic stated earlier, biosimilars are very different from generics. And particularly in this category, keeping the patient in the center of all these. We've got a tremendous amount of experience in the biologics category, going back to PROCRIT, REMICADE, (1:09:51). And we think that the differences between molecules can have \u2013 manifest themselves in significant ways with patients. So making sure. And I think things that we'll be watching for at the AC are, what kind of data do the biosimilars actually have? What kinds of indications? What will be the guidance around substitutability? All those frankly, sitting here today, are unknowns. We're going to need more clarification. But we think each of those means that the expected uptake, even when a biosimilar does launch, will lead to a significantly different curve than what you see with generics. We think secondly, it's very important to actually think about it from our patient perspective. And we know for example there's about 2.5 million patients with REMICADE. And about 70% of those are either continuing therapy and have a pretty high satisfaction rate. So if you look at the available population who's likely to be switched, we think it's in the 30% range. And last but certainly not least, there's the whole issue of the business model and the way that we actually work with customers in this setting. And this is an area where we've got a lot of experience in contracting. We've got some great relationships with providers in this area right now. We also have a very broad portfolio. If you think about what REMICADE does, but you look more broadly at the performance recently of a product like STELARA, a multi-billion-dollar compound growing at 20%-plus rate. If you look at SIMPONI, same thing. SIMPONI ARIA in particular, the great dosing convenience that it provides. That's another multi-billion-dollar addition that we have to that portfolio. Then you augment that with the submissions that we have in 2016 planned for Guselkumab, Sirukumab, an IL-23, and an IL-6, we think that that positions us very well with our portfolio and from a contracting point of view with large providers and payers in \u2013 certainly in the U.S. but also abroad. What we're seeing outside the United States is in most of the markets where they're introduced is a relatively minor impact. We're seeing that we're holding onto about 90%, plus or minus. It varies by market. You have to look at each one individually. And it's difficult to project exactly what that impact will be going forward. But I think when we think of it broadly across all those different areas, what's the clinical data show, what ultimately is the labeling, the regulatory aspects, what about our contracting, the business aspects, and we think all those are very important, will result in a different impact from biosimilars. And ultimately we'll continue to defend our intellectual property as well through what we believe is the right patent in September of 2018. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question, guys. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And just to add to that we have REMICADE in Canada as a Johnson & Johnson product. And we've seen fairly \u2013 it's actually still growing in Canada, even with the biosimilar there. Now the biosimilar has a limited indication there, but it's still growing. And we'll be listening to Merck's call as well to see of the latest in Europe. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much, guys. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. Just a \u2013 it's noisy. Anyway just a question for you, Dominic, and then I have a question for Alex. Just trying to understand the difference between consensus estimates for 2016 and your guidance. Do you have a sense for what the Street was assuming for non-operating income? When I go back historically, that's been in the $500 million to $600 million range. Clearly it was $2 billion last year. But just curious to know what consensus models had assumed for that? Secondly, did your guidance assume that the medical device tax would be suspended, as I think we've seen with other device companies? Just curious to know if that savings is reinvested in the business? Or if that is part of the guidance? And then for you, Alex, just curious to know your thoughts on pricing? I mean we heard Bernie [Sanders] and Hillary [Clinton] last night go after drug pricing again. And I don't think \u2013 I think that's also something we're going to hear from the Republican candidates. What are your expectations in terms of pricing in 2016 and 2017? Do you expect that there will be a change in terms of list prices going forward? Thanks very much. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Jami, let me try to take the first two, and then have Alex \u2013 maybe you'll comment on the drug pricing. You're referring to our non-operating, let's call it the other income and expense line for 2016, what was assumed in analysts' models versus what we have provided in guidance. When we looked at the analysts' consensus models, overall it looked like that number averaged in the high $900s million, so nearly $1 billion. And our guidance of course is somewhere $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. So our guidance is slightly higher than the analysts' models. But just as a reminder we always take the opportunity to \u2013 since these are portfolio choices to use any of those gains to offset some other expenses we'd like to invest in. And then with respect to the medical device tax the \u2013 we have assumed that it would be a benefit in 2016. But I must say the benefit for us is very, very minor. Remember when the medical device tax is incurred, it's incurred upon the first manufacture of a product. And therefore it can be for, for example, orthopedic companies hung up in inventory for quite some time. So the overall impact of not having a medical device tax in 2016 is not significant for Johnson & Johnson. It may be significant for certain other companies that maybe are pure orthopedic players, but not overall significant for us. And secondly, I would say that whatever benefit we see there we've already assumed would be reinvested in innovation, because of course during the time that the medical device tax was a drag on earnings, obviously decisions had to be made on where to invest. Now we're happy that with that easement of the device tax for a couple years, we'll be able to actually invest more in innovation in the medical device space. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jami, thanks for the question on pricing. Look, we realize and understand the pricing in pharmaceuticals, let alone in all of healthcare, is certainly a very important issue. And we believe that it's important to consider it just in that way. As we think about pharmaceuticals for example, they currently make up about 12% of healthcare spending in the United States, slightly higher in Europe. If you think about medical devices, they represent about 6%. And if you go beyond those areas of course, there's a lot of other costs built into that system, ranging from hospital, patient care, insurance companies, many other people. And particularly in an environment today, where frankly we're seeing such transformational outcomes and moving more and more towards cures, disease prevention, interception than we ever have, because of some of the great science that's being produced. So we understand and would certainly expect there to be a continued spotlight in this area. Obviously we're working with a lot of stakeholders to try and make sure that we look at it in a very holistic way. And it's very I think difficult at this point in time to try to project what's going to happen in 2016 or 2017. All of us know that the healthcare system not only here in the United States, but frankly around the world, is complex. There's a lot of other \u2013 a lot of issues that are intertwined. And \u2013 but it's obviously a conversation that we'll be participating in. And ultimately where we want to be part of the solution. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just a couple on the Pharma side. I guess one on the Pharma side and then one other one for Dominic. You mentioned STELARA, and you mentioned the strong quarter and 20% growth it's showing. I'm just wondering if you can share a little bit, as you thought about 2016 and maybe beyond, your expectation of that product going forward, just given the competition it's going to face from the IL-17s, both in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So is this sort of 20% range still sustainable? Or do you think you'll see more of a decline? And then second for Dominic, just on the guidance. And I apologize if I missed this. But in terms of your EPS guidance can you comment on what share count you're using to get to that guidance? Or just give some sense of the buybacks against the year that you've sort of incorporated into the way you think about the year? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Why don't I take that part first? So, Vamil, we obviously \u2013 we announced the share buyback in October. And I said we already through the fourth quarter spent about $1 billion dollars of that $10 billion. In our plans for 2016 we have not assumed that it's totally complete. But certainly more than a majority of the share buyback will be completed by the end of 2016, maybe three-quarters of it, sort of around that range. And that's what we've assumed in our models for 2016, the guidance I just gave. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Vamil, thanks for the question. Look, if we look at STELARA, one, it just starts with a great compound. It's had very nice uptake, very good growth. And we've certainly seen that in psoriatic arthritis. But we're also excited about the planned indications in areas like UC and axial spondylitis. So when you take the profile, the momentum that we're seeing in the current marketplace, and the share that continues to grow, you combine it with some additional indications as we go forward, particularly as part of our broader immunology portfolio, we think that there's \u2013 and the other important issue, I believe this category is only about 22% or 23% penetrated. So in terms of new patients that are coming in, all of that represents a nice growth opportunity for this important product. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Kristen. Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, the first for Dominic. I believe a couple years ago you talked about the opportunities for margin expansion within Consumer. We really haven't seen that just yet. With most of the products (1:20:59) in the OTC business, do we expect to see Consumer really starting to reach an inflection point? And would the goal \u2013 I believe, Sandi [Peterson] had talked about 2 years ago at the last kind of Consumer update really getting back into that kind of 20% range \u2013 still really achievable in the next couple years? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Kristen, we do expect that the Consumer business, now that the products have been launched and the cost remediations associated with the consent decree are largely behind us \u2013 although we still comply with the consent decree for another 5 years. We did want to launch those products with the right support. But it is true that we do expect, and we'll see it in 2016 and we'll report on it later in the year throughout the quarters, an improvement in the operating margins of the Consumer business going forward. Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Then for Alex, I guess just following that, will M&A be a key driver to improving the margins or any sort of portfolio management? And then more broadly \u2013 I know I've always asked Dominic this question every now and again. I guess you guys have always talked about the fourth leg. And we've seen some of your competitors go to more solutions-based approach and wraparound programs. I know you have some of those as well, particularly within the orthopedics business. Is that something that you think of when you're thinking about M&A moving more towards a holistic healthcare model and maybe perhaps rolling in some more lifestyle disease management programs or something more on the service side? Thanks. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Look, I'd just pick up with what Dominic had just said about our Consumer business is that I'm really proud of the work they've done on the consent decree and the great strides that they have taken around quality. In fact, I think in working closely and partnering with the FDA, we likely have a benchmark organization now. And we're really proud of having done that. At the same time I think it is \u2013 as they begin to ship from only remediation to remediation and relaunch across a number of these areas, while certainly keeping a very high eye on quality, as we increase our volumes, as we are able to deepen our relationships with a lot of the major trade partners, that's where we see a great growth opportunity as well. And obviously, that's going to have an impact on our margins as we go forward. I also think that the other thing that that team is doing is, as we're transitioning more and more to online marketing versus just traditional marketing, the way we're partnering with some of the large customers, I think that there's a lot of opportunities not only to drive share and volume but actually to improve efficiencies on our back end as well. As I step back and look more broadly, we think the three areas that we're in, Consumer, Medical Devices, and Pharmaceuticals, are all great platforms and great businesses. Of course we would look first for areas that \u2013 what is the next ZYTIGA? What's the next vision care platform? What's the next NEUTROGENA? That would certainly be our focus. Another would be, are there chances to grow in perhaps some of the faster-growing developing markets? With the right kind of opportunity, those are things that we would be interested in. And then what are ways to complement our existing businesses? I think the way that you pointed out, as the markets evolve we are looking not only at M&A, but also broader partnerships that we've done for example with companies like Google and Verily, where we see a big opportunity to really help transform the robotic surgery space in a pretty significant way longer term. And then I guess the final option there would be for us to actually acquire something outside the current three. And again, if it's something where we thought there was a lot of unmet patient or consumer need, if we feel that it's consistent with the capabilities that we can bring to bear to actually have it be a successful business, if the financials work, then we would take that step. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So two things, and I'll just rattle them off. First, I was wondering if you guys could comment a little bit on emerging market growth in Q4 relative to trends earlier in the year? And then, more importantly, just talk about the current operating environment in China. And when do you think we could see a reacceleration of emerging market growth for J&J? That's question number one. And then question number two is just back to the original question on the 200 basis points of pre-tax operating margin improvement in 2016. I was wondering if you could give us just a little more detail on exactly where that comes from? Maybe mention how much extra spend was there in 2015 that won't materialize in 2016? Just looking for a little bit more color there. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. So on the emerging markets growth, excluding the impact of course of Cordis and OCD, it was about 6.5% in the fourth quarter and a year-to-date basis it was about 5.5%. Those are both operational numbers. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : And on China, just a couple comments. That China, we did see a slowdown in China primarily in the Consumer business, because both Medical Devices and Pharma businesses still had high single digit growth in China. And we're optimistic about China going into 2016. Our plans are for improved growth in China in 2016. But I just want to put China in perspective. It's less than 5% of our sales. It's an important market for us longer term with 1.3 billion people and lots of healthcare needs, et cetera. But any short-term changes in their economy is unlikely to have any significant impact on our results. And then on the 200 basis point improvement, Bob, it's actually across all three lines of the P&L, COGS, selling, marketing, as well as R&D. So in the case of COGS where we have a long-term program that we've been executing on to reduce footprint, we're accelerating some of those programs. That'll benefit us on the COGS line. On the selling, marketing, and administrative line, I talked earlier about the fact that we had a program in place for a couple years, shooting for $1 billion of cost savings by 2018. We're well on our way. We'll see cost reductions in that line. And R&D, that depends on the individual licensing deals that we have and the timing of when we would spend those milestone payments or enter into new licensing agreements. But as it looks today the advancement in the portfolio in 2015 from the milestone payments, et cetera, are not expected to be at the same level in 2016 that they were in 2015. So it's across all three lines in the P&L. And I can't give you an exact number on the amount of extra investment we made in 2015 but just to say that we had $2.8 billion of other income in 2015, well above the years past. And we still improved overall income before tax by not quite that amount. Right? So most of it was reinvested in the business. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Very helpful. Thank you, Dominic. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. We'll take two more questions. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just have one for Alex. And you have a formal plan in place to accelerate growth in the Medical Device unit that's reasonable. And I believe your target of returning in it to 4% to 5% or 4% to 6% growth. I just wanted to ask how patient you'll be before you look externally in a transformational way? And is this a 12- to 24-month initiative or longer time period that you'll put in place? Thanks a lot. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Josh, thanks a lot for the question. What I would say is this is something that has been underway for the last several months. But clearly we're accelerating it. And whenever you make this kind of a decision, we certainly think about the impact that it has on employees. But we also see it as our responsibility to make sure that this business is positioned for the next 5 years, the next 10 years. And with that note we have a high sense of urgency about increasing our rate of innovation, about making the business model changes, and ultimately about making sure that we're more competitive and delivering in the markets. We try to be very clear where our goal is to grow faster than the markets. Even given our size and given our scale, we think we've got over 10 platforms that are $1 billion. The majority of those are number one or number two. But we realize there's still a lot of opportunity. So while we're pleased with what we've seen, we're far from satisfied. And I know Gary and the rest of his team as well as all of us are completely committed to accelerating the performance of this group to be frankly benchmark in the industry. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. And we'll take the last question. And Alex will provide some brief closing remarks. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our final... Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Operator : Yes. Our final question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just two quick ones. I'll start with a strategic one for Alex and then a quick Pharma question for Dominic or others. Alex, just thinking about M&A for a second. I know it's been a theme for this call. But how does segment performance influence your willingness to deploy capital in those segments? So are you more inclined to deploy capital in outperforming segments or not? And I guess related, does it make sense to deploy material capital in devices through M&A until the restructuring has been digested and growth is back to market rates in those franchises? And then I have a quick question for Dominic. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. David, thanks for the question. Look, it depends on a number of different factors. And obviously as we think about it for example in our Pharmaceutical group, we think that the model that we pull together, where we try to find the next INVOKANA, the next DARZALEX, very early compounds, where frankly we've got solid scientific insight. We bring it inside. And because of our clinical development and our regulatory capabilities, we can launch. And then very strong sales, marketing, and reimbursement practices around that. Frankly that's what's helped us create the number of $1 billion blockbusters that we've been able to launch since 2009. And I think 16 new products and seven of which are like right at $1 billion or shortly will be. And so we think that's a good model. In Medical Devices we've done tuck-ins as well as large. And look, I think in both cases, whether it's Pharma or Medical Devices, the smaller tuck-ins are frankly more straightforward to get done. We haven't shied \u2013 we won't shy away from large where we think it makes for a significant opportunity. And it's something that we'll continue to look at in Consumer. As far as the question if it's underperforming or not, I think it depends on why it's underperforming. If it's an exogenous market shift or something else, then obviously that would not necessarily have us shy away from that particular area. On the other hand if it's an internal, more executional issue, absolutely we'd want to make sure that we've got the knitting where we need it before we add onto that particular opportunity. So that's the way we tend to look at it. But again it's part of a broader strategic question, really on how we're managing the portfolio across the enterprise. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And then to Dominic, just a quick one for you or the team. Just on INVOKANA, it hasn't come up yet on the call. I wonder if you can just give us a sense of what's happening in the market (1:33:24), as it relates to class expansion or your market share? And can you give us any update on the CANVAS trial? I'm looking at data in 2017. Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. So I'll give you the market share third quarter versus fourth quarter, which will give you some nice trend information. So and this is U.S. For the total we went from 6.3% in the third quarter to 6.5% in the fourth quarter. Primary care, we went from 5.6% to 5.8%. And endo is at flat at about 13% quarter-to-quarter. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : And the reading that we're getting from the field is that most physicians \u2013 and in fact some guidelines were recently published that the cardiovascular benefit that we saw with the other SGLT2 is most likely a class effect. And that's the way physicians treat it. And in fact the guidelines were just recently issued that called it a class effect. Our data won't be until sometime mid-2017 I believe... Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : 2017. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : ...on those results, where we'll actually then be able to put those results in our label. But until then I think the market recognizes it as a beneficial effect on cardiovascular. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. And so final remarks? Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So thank you very much, everybody. Look, and in closing I'd like to thank you again for joining today's call. We're pleased with the results we delivered in 2015. And we think our strong underlying operational growth across the enterprise, combined with a very high sense of urgency, gives us a lot of confidence as we head in 2016. And we're optimistic about the opportunities in healthcare and frankly about the underlying strength of our core business. So thank you very much. And I hope everyone has a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9%, and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%. On an operational basis, Asia-Pacific and Africa grew 3%. Europe declined 0.8%, and the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. declined by 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the U.S., and 3.8% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside-the-U.S. operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago. As a reference, in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and a charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $98 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%. Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated, and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with U.S. sales down 0.1%, while outside-the-U.S. sales were down 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S., and 0.5% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to women's health, oral care, and baby care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and oral care. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic share growth and an inventory build as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth quarter distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in oral care. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide in the U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.3%, 16.2%, and 7.1%, respectively. As we discussed last year, U.S. results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross-to-net, including managed Medicaid rebates. In the first quarter this year, U.S. results included an adjustment for a similar amount, and therefore overall growth was not impacted. However, on a product basis, STELARA growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, XARELTO by four points, and REMICADE by three points. Significant contributors to growth were immunology products REMICADE, STELARA, and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA, oncology products IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX, as well as cardiovascular metabolic products XARELTO and INVOKANA. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as the gross-to-net adjustment to sales that I mentioned. Combined REMICADE export sales and international sales grew approximately 11%. Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%. Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17% due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth. Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals, and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 65 countries. DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake. DARZALEX contributed over 2% to the U.S. Pharmaceutical growth rate. XARELTO sales were up 29%, and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 point and 0.3 points, respectively. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care. On a sequential basis, sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions, as well as increased competition and formulary positions. INVOKANA access remains strong at 80% preferred for combined commercial and Part D. I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%. U.S. sales increased 2.2% while sales outside the U.S. declined 1%. Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide, with the U.S. up 3.3% and the growth of 2.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopedics, advanced surgery, and electrophysiology. Orthopedic sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips and U.S. trauma and spine. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. orthopedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips, and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to results. Orthopedic sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China due to a softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products, with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgicals growth of 8%, and energy growth of 8%. Base electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone. We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, and we continue to make very good progress on our nearer-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed during our January call. We remain confident in the strength of our business. As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, as well as hepatitis C sales, and a few extra shipping days in 2015, was 5.5%. On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter, with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analyst estimates. In our Pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter, with underlying operational growth at over 12%. First quarter underlying operational sales growth for Consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier. In Medical Devices, we're off to a good start in the first quarter, with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%. Growth in our consumer-facing Medical Device businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market. For the hospital-focused Medical Device businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement, with underlying operational growth in those businesses of approximately 4%, driven by strength in our orthopedics, advanced surgery, and electrophysiology businesses. We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pre-tax operating margin. For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis, and we remain comfortable with that forecast, as we will accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative, and R&D expenses. Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments from the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. During the quarter, we had several key developments across the business. In our Pharmaceutical business, we received an additional approval for IMBRUVICA for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with TESARO for exclusive rights to the investigational compound niraparib in prostate cancer. Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor. We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges through collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry, with a call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in the United States. In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlled substance raw material and API business. In 2015, these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales. This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016. In Medical Devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a privately held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18, which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep-C sales, it was a strong 6.9%. If you will direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following, intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our Medical Devices restructuring charge. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 10 basis points, mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales, or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to continued good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5%, higher than the prior year, due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. Our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior-year period. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, and the current mix of our business. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2015 year-end call, we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year. Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set. This was driven by higher margins in both Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and somewhat lower margins in our Consumer business as compared to our competitive set. In the first quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Our Consumer business had a lower margin this year as compared to last year, due principally to devaluation in Venezuela. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full-year 2016 as compared to 2015. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt. As you know, in February we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales, and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and this is also unchanged versus our January guidance. And now a word on taxes, our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015. We are therefore comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points than our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016 than we anticipated in our previous guidance. And now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrant for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption with regard to REMICADE biosimilar remains unchanged, even with the recent FDA approval of INFLECTRA, due to our intellectual property, which we intend to defend. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable to last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year, which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%. This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely, as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, higher than our previous guidance. Now turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance. If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximate $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates. As it's still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year. Namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5%, consistent with 2015 growth on a comparable basis. Our operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operational adjusted EPS growth in our guidance remains strong, in the range of 6% to 8%, and our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. In particular, we're pleased to see our Medical Device businesses showing continued signs of improvement, and our restructuring activities in that business are on track. And we look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day. Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Dominic. And, Manny, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. With that, our first question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, David. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. I'm going to start with a strategic question for Dominic, and then one follow-up. Dominic, the longstanding view of J&J has been to assert the defensiveness of having these three major franchises under the J&J family of companies. Does that still remain the prevailing view of management and the board? And then I had a quick follow-up. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, David, it's our view, both management and the board, that our broadly-based business is the right approach to have in healthcare. It certainly has served us well and we expect it will continue to serve us well as the healthcare industry evolves in the future. We think of ourselves as a healthcare company, and of course that allows us to access opportunities in healthcare no matter where they be, either in Pharma, Medical Devices, or in Consumer Health. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. And then the second question, either for Louise or Dominic, just REMICADE gross-to-net dynamics in the quarter, any more detail you can provide us on that or any sense of what you're expecting net pricing gains to be for REMICADE in the U.S. for 2016? Thanks so much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. So as we've discussed, we had the prior year gross-to-net that you saw that contributed I think it was 3% to the REMICADE growth, and pricing dynamics continued to be okay in that market. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I don't think it's expected that REMICADE sales will be significantly impacted year over year by gross-to-net adjustments. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, next question, please. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Josh. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I know you've had some public comments, Dominic, recently around the REMICADE franchise. But now that we have the I-compound (30:23) panel and the FDA approval in the rearview window, clearly you don't expect any biosimilar competition in 2016 due to your defense of IP, but any updated thoughts on the potential impact of biosimilar competition to the REMICADE franchise in 2017 and beyond? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're right, Josh, we don't expect biosimilar competition in 2016. As you know, we have several patents that we intend to defend. For example, the U.S. patent, the '471 patent [U.S. Patent number 6,284,471], extends to 2018, and another patent that we have extends to 2027. Having said that, I think overall the immunology franchise of Johnson & Johnson is very strong because it's not just about REMICADE. Of course, we have STELARA, SIMPONI, et cetera. And the overall pipeline in the Pharmaceutical business, as you know from our review last May, is very, very robust, with 10 new products being filed, each of which having more than $1 billion potential. So overall we remain very, very comfortable with the growth outlook for the Pharmaceutical business regardless of the outcome of any REMICADE biosimilar. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. I just wanted to follow up with a question on your operating margin guidance maintaining at 200 basis points. I was just curious about the Venezuelan crisis impact. It looks like it primarily hit the Consumer units operating margins. But can you talk about the expectations of Venezuela's impact on your operating margins at the beginning of the year, how your internal expectations have evolved? Clearly with maintaining that guidance, the performance of the rest of the business units are going to offset any direct impact from Venezuela. But I just wanted to hear about any offsets there and the impact to the operating margin performance of the Consumer unit. And can Consumer still experience operating margin expansion in 2016? Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Josh. Just to put things in perspective, Venezuela is less than 1% of our sales, less than 0.5% of our sales, so it's not a very significant impact. It is more significant in Consumer than in the other businesses. But we're very confident in our outlook for a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin expansion \u2013 pre-tax operating margin expansion for 2016. And that will be across all the businesses, including Consumer, who will make a significant contribution to that, even despite the impacts of Venezuela. So we're very confident with that outlook for the year. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Mike. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Mike. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. The immunology franchise, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA, all had much better growth than at least the scripts would have suggested. Outside of the gross-to-net, was there an inventory catch-up this quarter that might have impacted those products? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So in the U.S., nothing significant in the inventory. That market grows strong, strong double digits, and that is a good contributor to the immunology. STELARA continues to grow market share. SIMPONI ARIA is contributing to the results; but in the U.S., no significant inventory build. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Can we talk about DARZALEX? DARZALEX obviously had a very, very strong first full quarter out of the box here. Can you just talk about the uptake in multiple myeloma and how you see it playing out on the back of the relapsed refractory data? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Mike, we're obviously very pleased with the early uptake of DARZALEX. And as we said, it contributed two points of growth to our U.S. Pharma business, so off to a great start. The CD38 mechanism of action seems to be something that the KOLs [Key Opinion Leaders] really respect as having a significant impact on the disease. And we think the product is going to do extremely well and will see continued uptake throughout the year. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And also we had the CASTOR trial, which actually the IDMC [Independent Data Monitoring Committee] has recommended to stop early. So that's a very positive sign as well in that instance. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Dominic, one quick finance question for you. The tax rate coming down runs a little bit counter to the performance of the business because your growth in the U.S. has been so strong, particularly in the Pharmaceutical business. So what we see optically is very strong U.S. revenue growth and we assume U.S. profit growth. But obviously, the manufacturing IP of some of those products is outside the U.S. Can you just shed a little bit of light there on how you're managing that because the U.S. business relative to the OUS business looks very different? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Mike, it's an interesting observation. Actually, the strength of the sales in any one particular region does not necessarily correlate with the strength of the earnings in that region, and it's for the very reason that you mentioned, which is where the IP is located, where the manufacturing takes place, et cetera. So what we did is we just updated our outlook with how the profits will fall amongst the different regions and different jurisdictions. And we thought about 0.5 point improvement in the overall tax rate would be achievable this year for the full year, and therefore we adjusted that in our outlook. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thank you, Dominic. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Kristen. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Kristen. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the diabetes business. I think, Dominic, you had mentioned there are challenges in the market. I was just wondering if you could comment about INVOKANA and the additional competition that's in the market or just provide a little bit more commentary there. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Just to clarify what I said, I was talking about challenges in the market with respect to our consumer Medical Device diabetes business, the LifeScan business. And what I meant by that was we see continued pricing pressure in that market, and we also see some competition with respect to new pumps being launched. We've just launched a new pump obviously, so we're also seeing good uptake with our current pump. So the dynamics I'm talking about are in the Medical Device piece of the business as being challenging. Overall, INVOKANA continues to do well. Its uptake is strong quarter over quarter and remains a growth driver for us going forward. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess just more broadly, what are you seeing \u2013 can you just go back and address China? I know that was something that you had brought up just in terms of still seeing a little bit of softness, I think you had mentioned more within the Medical Device segment. Any changes there, is it getting worse or getting any better? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. China again, just to put it in perspective, it's about 5% of our overall business. And a slowdown in the economy actually last year is what caused some distributor inventory to be at relatively high levels. That distributor inventory is beginning to bleed off. We saw that in the first quarter, and we think that that bleed-off will be completed shortly. So we don't expect to see a continued impact of that for the rest of the year. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, perfect. Thanks, everyone. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good morning. I have a few questions. Just back to Kristen's question on diabetes, INVOKANA is an important growth driver for the company, but sales did come in a bit lighter than we had anticipated, despite I think the growing excitement about this class of drugs. Dominic, can you comment just generally on what drug categories you are seeing widening gross-to-net discounts? And are you seeing more gross-to-net discounts or widening discounts specifically in diabetes? And can you comment on where you might be seeing that elsewhere in the Pharma business? My second question is on the OTC business. You've clearly highlighted the strong growth that you're seeing in the U.S. and particularly the analgesics market. How much of that growth is just regaining back lost market share from private label when you were out of the market, and how much of that is market growth? And maybe you can comment just generally on the dynamics of the OTC marketplace and where you see store brand market share now. Thanks, and I have one more follow-up, one more follow-up. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Wow. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, let's take them in order. And, Louise, you could add, obviously, if I've left anything out. I wouldn't say, Jami, that there's any one particular area in the business where we see a widening of gross-to-net or rebating that's any different than what we've seen before in the business. So rather than comment on any one particular area, I would say generally speaking there's nothing that sticks out to us as a widening trend. With respect to U.S. OTC, a couple things to mention; we are gaining back share, and the products are doing very, very well. And this particular quarter was a relatively low growth market quarter because of a very, very soft flu season, a very, very soft flu season. So most of the growth that we saw is not on the back of market expansion but on the back of share expansion as we continue to regain share. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Are you where you want to be in terms of regaining back that lost share, and what is a realistic goal? You were out of the market completely. Where are you now? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : So we're not where we want to be. We're continuing \u2013 we're pleased. As Alex [Gorsky] often says, we're pleased but not satisfied. So we're going to continue to gain share there. And, Louise, do you have the year-over-year comparison of share? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, so in 2009, before the McNeil issues that we had, the adult share was about 25%, and we're back to 14%. And pediatric was about 70%, and we're now back to 46%, so you're seeing some nice growth on that. And if you take a look at year over year, the adult (sic) [pediatric] (40:56) share a year ago was 43%, so you see it going up about three points. And then the pediatric share is also going up to the 46%. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : So we're making progress. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : I'm sorry, that was pediatric share, sorry, from 43% to 46%. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : We're making progress, Jami, but we're not finished. I think these products have a long heritage and legacy. They're very, very important in overall healthcare. And quite frankly, they're admired by consumers. So we expect to see continued share growth. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And in the adult, it was 14% U.S. share now, and it was 12%. And you asked about the private label. We think in the U.S. market, the adult is about a third, and in the pediatric it's about 40%. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, and then just can I follow up, Dominic? I'm actually shocked that I'm what, the fifth, sixth question and this hasn't come up yet. Your net cash position is now $17 billion. That keeps growing. I don't think any company that I cover or anybody else covers has the kind of balance sheet prowess that you have, the lack of debt on your balance sheet. And I think what was it, back in September at an investor conference you had mentioned that you were uncomfortable with the amount of cash that you had growing on the balance sheet. And now here we are six to seven months later and don't really see any activity with respect to putting that cash to work with the exception of a buyback that you announced earlier this year. Can you just give us an update on your thoughts on capital allocation? Clearly, we've had a lot of disruption in the marketplace, with valuations on many names coming back. And I'm just surprised that we haven't really seen much action on the part of capital allocation from J&J. Thanks, and then I'm done. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, sure, Jami. Okay, great. Okay, good, all right. Just to clarify, back in September, I didn't really say I was uncomfortable with the level of cash. I just said that it was a higher level of cash than we normally hold. And then of course, after that we announced a $10 billion share buyback. So we're very conscious of the fact that while we're evaluating M&A opportunities, we can continue to return capital to shareholders, which in addition to our very, very strong dividend, we can do share buybacks. We're in the middle of doing one right now, and we'll obviously evaluate whether we continue increase that particular share buyback as time goes on. With respect to not allocating capital to any particular deals, I could tell you that we're very active, but as you know, we're also very disciplined. We do see opportunities, but we want to do the right deal at the right time with the right party at the right valuation. And we're comfortable waiting for that to take place because we think that's what ultimately generates the most value for shareholders. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Is that what you plan to do with your cash, M&A, Dominic? Is that what the message is today? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : The message is very consistent, what it's always been. Our first priority is allocating capital to dividends. So we'll announce what we're going to do with dividends at our April 28 shareholder meeting. After that, we'd like to grow the business and create value for shareholders through M&A. And in addition to that, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through share purchases, repurchase. So it's not really a change. So our attitude, our capital allocation policy does not change depending on how much capital we have. It's all about creating the most value for shareholders with whatever capital we deploy. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning, good morning, just two questions. Let me first just piggyback on what Jami just asked because I think we're all surprised that J&J hasn't done more with the balance sheet so far. And I'm just wondering, Dominic, as you're having these discussions, it appears that some of the targets you may be having discussions with have unrealistic valuation expectations. So maybe talk about where valuation expectations have come. Are they getting at least in the ballpark of what J&J thinks is appropriate valuation? And then with Allergan and Pfizer no longer getting together, you have two more companies that are going to be actively looking at deals. And does that make the competitive landscape more challenging for J&J? And then I had a follow-up on devices. Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Glenn. In certain areas of the market, valuations are still high. They're coming down, as you know, in biotech in particular. But in certain other areas, in med device, for example, certain valuations are still inflated, in our opinion. Things will get better as time goes on, we believe. We're patient, disciplined. And as I said earlier, we'll look for the right opportunity, but at the right time at the right valuation. With respect to Allergan and Pfizer maybe being in the market now and creating more competition, that's probably true. I can't speak for what they're going to do, but we're accustomed to looking at various acquisition candidates where more than one party may be interested in a particular asset. That does not dissuade us from being disciplined and having a clear focus on ultimately what matters, which is the deployment of that capital to create shareholder value. So yes, there will be more competition. We'll still remain very disciplined. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, and then let me just follow up on the Device business. When you ex out divestitures and currency, the Device business grew 3% in the first quarter, and that's pretty much in line with most of the device categories that we cover. But I don't think J&J had any major new product launches here recently. So is the improvement in the Device business for J&J, is that just better execution and better blocking and tackling, or did some of the major end markets in cardio and ortho and spine in the first quarter come in slightly better than you expected? Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Just to clarify, 3% overall is the Medical Device business ex-acquisition and divestitures, but the hospital-based Medical Device business excluding the consumer-facing Medical Device businesses, that grew 4% on a comparable basis. We did have a number of products that we filed last year, and we have about 30 new products that we're launching. Half of those have already been launched, so we are seeing the impact of those. And I think it's also a matter of focus, focus on the primary growth drivers. For example, you saw very good results in energy, in endocutters, in electrophysiology as major drivers of growth. And also we're very pleased with the results in orthopedics. And the ATTUNE Knee, for example, in the U.S. in particular, the U.S. growth was over 8% for knees, which is pretty fantastic growth, and the ATTUNE knee is still a new product that's being launched in that marketplace. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : But as you talk to division heads, is everything \u2013 are the end markets status quo, no change, still stable, or is there any pickup in some of these end markets? Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think from what we've seen back in the fourth quarter trends, because we don't have all the first quarter trends, continued improvement in procedural growth, but not dramatic, Glenn, just a continued steady improvement in procedural growth. Anything else, Louise? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So our estimate of the first quarter hip market is about 3.5% in the U.S., again qualified, but we haven't seen all the competitors report. We think the U.S. knee market grew about 4.5%, and we believe we grew faster than those markets. Now we did have about 1.5 extra selling days. But even if you take that out of there, we do believe we grew faster than the market in hips and knees in the U.S. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Louise. Thank you, Dominic. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : You're welcome. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome, Glenn. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning Vamil. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions, so just a couple following up on some of the topics that have been raised already. The one we've specifically been getting a lot of questions are around your desire on the Consumer side to maybe do business development. I know you talked generally about M&A. Maybe if you could, just provide a little more color on the Consumer side specifically and if it is an area where you're looking to boost. Is there a preference you can share? I think in the past you've talked about emerging markets, but I was just wondering if there is anything more timely you can share today on that side of things. And then the second question relates back to the INVOKANA discussion that we were having before. There was this announcement last week that the EMA [European Medicines Agency] is looking into an increase in amputations that is being seen in the CANVAS study. I'm curious if you have any comments on that at this point. And also, is that something that the FDA is also looking into at this point? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Vamil. So on M&A, just in general we're looking at M&A as an important additional growth driver in all of our businesses, including Consumer. As we've said before, Consumer can generally benefit from taking very, very specific brands that are in certain regional categories. We're certainly in our sweet spot of skin care, baby, oral care, et cetera, where we think we could do better with a combination of the technology that we have and the overall market and distribution presence that we have. So we'll continue to look there. And again, like every other M&A evaluation, we'll make sure that it's at the right valuation at the right time. With respect to INVOKANA, a couple things to mention there. There has been \u2013 previous to this CANVAS study, there have been 12 previous studies with INVOKANA where we saw no such indication of increase in lower limb amputations, particularly the toe, so this seems to be focused only on the patients in the CANVAS study. It's important to note that, yes, that European regulatory body is taking a look at it, but already the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial after reviewing all the data concluded that the trial should continue. So that's what I can tell you about that. And obviously, we'll look to advise physicians appropriately of the results once we have more understanding of them. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, just a couple on the Pharma segment. You guys have a new product cycle obviously coming up with guselkumab and sirukumab. I guess when you think about this in the context of the pricing environment, especially with INFLECTRA down the road, how do you guys think about durability of pricing in the immunology segment? And I have one more follow-up on Pharma. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, sure, Geoff. Both guselkumab and sirukumab are different mechanisms of action than the current products that we have in immunology. And typically, innovative products that have a significant impact on unmet medical need \u2013 in this case it would be those patients that are not otherwise responding to, for example, TNF therapy, our view is that pricing will still continue to be \u2013 the products will still continue to be valued and therefore not have a lot of pressure on pricing because there is some still significant unmet medical need, and it's a new mechanism of action that should have an impact on patients. I think that that's irrespective of whether or not there's a biosimilar in the market with respect to REMICADE because overall pricing for immunology products, particularly in the TNF category, already have pretty significant gross-to-net discounts in the marketplace. I think we've talked before about that ours are already in the 25% range, so I don't think there's that much room for there to be significantly lower pricing in that market. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. And just as a follow-up to the other questions on M&A, the TESARO agreement with the PARP, clearly there's a lot of excitement with this class. I guess the question is, was the focus on prostate strategic or is it data-driven? I just want to get your sense, Dominic, for maybe other indications that you could have some enthusiasm for, for PARP, such as ovarian or breast cancer, et cetera. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Our agreement with respect to this PARP inhibitor was a result of our oncology therapeutic area, taking a look at where PARPs can have an added benefit. Our first approach to this is going to be with prostate cancer in conjunction with our development of ARN-509 in prostate cancer, so the particular focus at the moment is in prostate cancer, Geoff. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you, thanks. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Damien. Damien Conover - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, just a question on the nerve growth factor discontinuation. It looked like there was a prioritization within the pipeline to discontinue that. I just had a question what projects you might be accelerating also, given that those Phase 3 studies are coming up shortly. I just wanted to understand that a little bit more. Also, with the hepatitis C products there, you have some very potent products. I wanted to see what the next steps were for bringing those to the market, the timeline. And then lastly, just on REMICADE, has J&J received a 180-day notice of a biosimilar launch from Pfizer? Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : All right, let me take them in the order you gave them, and Louise can help here as well. So with respect to \u2013 why don't you take the hepatitis C question? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, so we're expecting to see some Phase 2 data of our AL-335 and the three direct-acting inhibitors in 2016. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Right, and also with respect to your question on the 180-day notice period, yes, we have received that from Celltrion. And with respect to the growth nerve factor discontinuance, what you said was exactly right. This was a portfolio question. As we mentioned, we have 10 new products that we're planning to file between now and 2019. Obviously, we're going to focus on those. They all have more than $1 billion potential. So we make portfolio decisions all the time, and this is just another one of those types of decisions. Damien Conover - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Great, thank you. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Matt. Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. This is Vik in for Matt. I have two questions. Now that the CJR [Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement] bundle payment system is in effect for hips and knees, can you talk a little bit about your approach to customers and what you can expect to help there? And the second question I have is an update on the payer environment in spine, any meaningful changes that you guys have seen in support amongst payers? Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Generally speaking, on the bundling approach, which is now present in certain markets but not across all markets in the U.S., we do think that we're positioned very well there because obviously we have a very broad portfolio of products. So the bundling approach with the hospital or integrated care network would include multiple Johnson & Johnson products, which we think we're in a great position to partner with in that regard. The payer economics in spine, we haven't seen much of a dramatic change there. One thing I'd like to point out is we did see growth in our spine business this quarter of about 2%. So we're very pleased with that business coming back and showing some improvement. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Larry. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. I hope you can hear me okay. So, Dominic, on the call today, you guided organic sales growth in 2016 about the same as in 2015, which was 5.5% excluding the benefit from extra selling days. However, if we compare 2016 to 2015, organic growth on the same 52-week basis, we estimate that your 2016 organic growth should be closer to 6% to 6.5%. In other words, the 5.5% in 2016 doesn't adjust for the extra selling days in 2015. Is our math directionally right, Dominic? And I had one follow-up. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think you're directionally right. I think you're right that without the \u2013 if you just neutralized I guess is what you did, for the extra selling days, we would see growth of better than 5.5%, right. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. And then lastly, Dominic, last week you announced that you discontinued UPP, or Unilateral Pricing Policy, in your VISTAKON business. Can you talk about the rationale there and what this signals regarding any change in your strategy and how you're running your contact lens business? If I recall, two years ago when you implemented UPP, it was disruptive to your U.S. VISTAKON business. So why should we not assume or be concerned that you might have similar types of disruptions from discontinuing UPP and moving to a different pricing model now? Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question, just a couple things on the Vision Care business and our ACUVUE brand. As you know, the ACUVUE business has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation, which creates fantastic products for contact lens wearers. And as you know, we are the world leader in contact lenses with the ACUVUE brand. And we just launched four new products in 2015, which are being received very well by the eye care professional and the contact lens wearer. Back in 2014, we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market, first of all. And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with very, very different pricing in different channels. So, we decided to implement the Unilateral Pricing Policy in order to even out the pricing. And at the end of the day, what happened there was we did see a lower overall price for our products, which made the products more affordable. So today the majority of the patients who get ACUVUE contact lenses are paying less than they did for that brand two years ago. Now with innovation and with the market stabilizing, we've adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam as prescribed by the eye care professional. And we think that's just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens. So just a continued evolution of how we approach the market, and there may be \u2013 when there is some slight disruption in the market, we think that overall the long-term benefit to the overall category into our business is worth it. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, and that concludes the Q&A. And we'll have some closing remarks from Dominic. Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, thanks, Louise. As I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our continued momentum as we entered into 2016. I would just like to take this time to recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin, Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice-President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation, and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date, and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement, and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to evaluating business performance period over period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Also to assist you with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3%, and currency had a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 15.4% with approximately a third of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter. Asia-Pacific Africa grew 2.1% while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures. The most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S., and 6.9% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4 billion, and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after tax special items of $631 million. 2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $230 million, and charges for after tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%. Now turning to the highlights for the first six months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally, and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S., and 5.4% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. Turning now to earnings, for the first six months of 2016, net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%. Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015, unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5% with U.S. sales up 2.1% while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points respectively, with the most significant impact to women's health, baby care, and oral care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by skin care, OTC, and oral care. In skin care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory builds drove double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and digestive health share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics, and digestive health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in oral care. Moving now to our Pharmaceuticals segment, worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7%, with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, U.S., and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9%, and 11.2% respectively. As you know, there are discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends. U.S. Pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015, and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points. On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately eight points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by eight points, and PROCRIT by 31 points. Significant contributors to growth were : immunology products REMICADE, STELARA, and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products XARELTO and INVOKANA. Within neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA, as well as the gross-to-net adjustments to U.S. sales that I mentioned. The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners was due to the impact of biosimilars. Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals, and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries. DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately two points to the U.S. Pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries. XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest copay for a branded product. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D. I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1% while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, with the U.S. up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points respectively. Growth was driven by Advanced Surgery, Electrophysiology, Orthopedics, and Vision Care. Strong results were achieved for Advanced Surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9%, and biosurgicals growth of 8%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter. Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. Orthopedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platforms in hips, and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results. Orthopedics sales outside the U.S. negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016. And we're pleased that our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers, and all others who use our products. When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed with all of our stakeholders. Now over the last 130 years, the people of Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier, and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focus strategies, and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's healthcare market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies. As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human healthcare is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad base is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent, and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the UK's vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year. Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. Our deep healthcare expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partners of choice for many companies, whether that means with innovative startups, information technology giants, or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. We also work with local governments and public health organizations, where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems across categories and establish new sources of innovation through convergent combination products. And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments. All of these advantages of our broad base in human healthcare contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders. And we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global healthcare to grow at 3% to 5% over the next five years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market. We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans of continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yield, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business. In fact, we have increased our spending on R&D every year for the last five years. We invest above industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business while also generating enterprise-adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks. After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs. In fact, over the last three-year, 10-year, and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite. And as you can see in this chart, we're off to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Through the first six months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6%. When you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales and operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. Through the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47. On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses, with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7% respectively. We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business in completion of the Synthes corporate integrity agreement. In Pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including: conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on the CASTOR and POLLUX studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX. We also received EU approval for front-line IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintain clinical remission after one year of treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Clinical trial and real-world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on Type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management. We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once-every-three-months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as well as line extension approval for both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. And just recently, FDA granted a fourth breakthrough therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft-versus-host disease, GVHD, which makes six total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far. In addition to these pipeline milestones, as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in-market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI. In Consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, oral care, baby and beauty. As part of our focus on the beauty space, we have just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market and are highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space. Vogue International has grown at double-digits over the last five years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25%, and the acquisition will take us from number eight to number four in the U.S. hair care market. And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our Consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years. And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum and accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in-line with market growth, and we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied. Our goal, to be clear, is to grow above market overall. And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth, like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, Inc., which filled a key portfolio gap in elective foot and ankle surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in-line with our near-term priority. Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. As we outlined during our Business Review Day, today about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multi-product line agreements. These agreements perform almost two times better than single product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward. And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk-sharing contracts and outcome-based patient solutions. We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our Medical Device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018. And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands. With all of this progress in our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long-term. With the progress we've made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our end market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline, and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive biosimilar or generic entrants and evolving market dynamics, and our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth. Our Consumer business is positioned to grow above-market while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. And in Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models. Our Consumer Medical Device businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand in large, growing markets with significant unmet needs. With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in healthcare and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation going beyond products and solutions will allow us to address the evolving healthcare landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way healthcare is delivered, managed and experienced. And finally, our broad base across human healthcare uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the healthcare market. But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improve outcomes for patients, consumers and their families. So I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialog during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who as most of you know from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationship she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson, and you may know that she is an incredibly committed credo-based leader who has had a remarkable career and impact on our company. I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experienced, respected advice and her ever-present determination to do what is in the best interest of all of Our Credo stakeholders. Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class investor relations function you've developed for us over the last decade, and we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson. Now we know we'll all be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President of Group Finance for our Pharmaceuticals Group will become Vice President, Investor Relations effective August 1, and transition with Louise over the next five months. We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent, incredible communication with you, our investors. So now I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from Institutional Investor and IR Magazine. And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report that Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's magazine as the number one most respected company for 2016. As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we are happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her. With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results, as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. As we previously discussed, in 2015 our underlying operational sales growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days in 2015 was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter and our sales results are above analyst estimates. Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement. As you may remember, for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pre-tax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later, and we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business, and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. Now, I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%. If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $900 million on an after tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following : intangible asset, asset amortization expense of about $200 million, litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million, and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year. And adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales, or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. Our pre-tax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit, less selling, marketing, and administrative, and R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year, and through six months we've achieved 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability. Interest expense, net of interest income, was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates in our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter, compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period. The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior-year period. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflects the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year. The current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA. And this gain, which as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business, but those investments occurred later in the year. If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income before tax margin would show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our Consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter. As you may recall from our Business Review Day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the Consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. Overall, we expect income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pre-tax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. Through the end of the second quarter, we've completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments, prior development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance, related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for a higher level of sales, as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today. And now just a word on taxes, during the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings when the employee exercises options or receives shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity. The first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share, and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter when we adopted the standard. The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax costs reflected in this quarter. For adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L. You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issues shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore, historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, so timing is less predictable for stock options. We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefits that I just described. Now, turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo. As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International, so our guidance now reflects six months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our Consumer business beginning the first full year, as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year. Also during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business, and therefore those sales will no longer be recorded. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As noted in our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016, primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as six additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016 excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance, as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely, as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. Of course, we're closely following the situation with the UK's vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take time to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. To put it into perspective, though, the UK represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance. And now, turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier. If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63 to $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance, due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. And at this point in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first six months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year. Namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong, in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share. That's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. Our businesses are continuing to invest while over-delivering on our growth expectations. And now, I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Dominic. Michelle, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Mike. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Dominic, just a couple items that we can hopefully get you to clarify. So number one is, what's the impact for the full-year EPS of ASU 2016-109 adoption? The tax rate coming down as it did suggests a range of anywhere from $0.04 to $0.12. Maybe you can help with that. And then second, can you just walk through the net impact of the Vogue acquisition and then the API business divestiture on sales and earnings? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Mike. With respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items. And the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopted in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year. Second quarter impact has already been offset by other items. And remaining quarterly impacts we think will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options. With respect to... Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So you're up \u2013 so your updated guidance, Dominic, doesn't assume any benefit in the second half of the year? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Right, that's right. Only the first quarter flow-through that we experienced. And as I said, that's the largest single quarter of any stock-based compensation tax benefit. Sales with respect to Vogue and the API business, Vogue for the full year is in a $350 million range, so we have about half a year of sales added to our guidance. And the API business was an annual business of about $250 million, and we'll have half a year of those sales no longer included in our guidance. So that's part of the increase in our overall growth in sales of about 0.5 point. The rest of it is due to the underlying strength we saw in the first six months. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the Pharma business, can I get you just to comment on a couple of items? So one, this is obviously a very important quarter for DARZALEX with the data we saw at ASCO and EHA. And just would love to get some high-level commentary on where you think that gets positioned going forward in multiple myeloma? And then, second, would you talk about the competitiveness of sirukumab, given the Phase three data we just saw at EULAR and your expectations there on filing, timing, and approval? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Let me say a few words on both and then, Alex, why don't you add a few and, Louise, also on the timing question. So DARZALEX, we're very pleased with the initial uptake of DARZALEX. The product is well received by the medical community. And the data, as you pointed out, continues to be very impressive. And we believe DARZALEX can be essentially backbone therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. So we expect that we'll get additional indications for DARZALEX. But it's already been quite well received by the investment community, having great results for patients and, as I said, likely to be backbone therapy, going forward. Sirukumab, also very positive data there. It's an important product in our autoimmune franchise. And, Alex, maybe you can comment a little bit more on that. And, Louise, on the timing of filing for sirukumab, I just don't have it handy, if you could give us that... Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : 2016. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : 2016, so we'll file this year for sirukumab. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike, Alex here. Look, we're excited about sirukumab on a number of fronts, first as an IL-6. We know in this category there's a lot of interpatient variability. And having another option for patients, and based upon the early data that we have seen in RA, some of that presented just recently at the EULAR conference, we're very encouraged by. We're going to be looking at it, obviously, in other areas. And I think what we're most enthusiastic about is, if you combine sirukumab along with the work that we're doing with guselkumab as well, the IL-23 being looked at in psoriasis, it's really going to help us build out an even stronger portfolio and platform in immunology as we go forward over the next several years. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Alex. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Larry. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Larry. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And, Louise, congratulations on your retirement. I know you'll be missed. So one for Dominic, financials to start off with and then just one market-related question. So Dominic, just on the guidance, two clarification questions. So the $0.10 raise at the lower end on operational EPS and the $0.05 on the high end, is $0.05 due to the accounting change and the rest due to the underlying strength in the business? And then, it appears there's a lot of moving parts on the sales guidance as well. That 5.5% in 2015 that you raised to 6% for 2016, by my math, it implies that you're expecting a similar growth in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2016, if one adjusts for the extra week in the year-ago period. So is that directionally accurate? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Larry. Well, with respect to EPS guidance, you mentioned two of the items, which obviously was tax as well as the stronger sales performance. But I just wanted to remind you that we also lowered our other income and expense guidance for the year. So one way to think about it is that other income and expense guidance is lower, the tax rate is also lower, those two generally offset. And the midpoint of the guidance is up about $0.07, when I do the midpoint versus the two ends, and the $0.07 is primarily due to the overall increase in sales guidance that we provided today. Your observations with respect to the back-half of the year, you're right that if we exclude the extra shipping days in 2015 from the analysis, the back-half of 2016 would be similar to what we saw for the first half. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And then, just on the market. In the U.S., maybe, Alex, if you could comment a little bit, or Dominic, on what you're seeing on procedure volume in the U.S. in ortho and, more broadly, in med tech, that would be great. Thank you. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Larry, we are seeing a pickup in terms of hospital admissions and surgical procedures. I think hospital admissions are up around 3%. We think the procedures are probably up around 3.5%. We continue to see some decrease overall in office physician visits, down 2%. And we think that that's just due to a more moderated utilization at the front-end due to increased co-pays and a number of other dynamics. But overall, if we look at the core growth rate in the medical hospital device area, we're encouraged by some of the recent trends that we're seeing. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Louise, we'll definitely be missing you, but congratulations. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about just on the capital allocation side. Obviously we saw Vogue. Is that what we should be thinking going forward in terms of the type of acquisitions to look forward to smaller, more like a tuck-in for you guys in that range? Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Kristen. Thanks a lot for the question, and I couldn't agree with you more regarding Louise. But look, we were really happy that we were able to add Vogue to the J&J Consumer portfolio. As we've been talking about over the last several years, we felt that what was most important in the Consumer group was to actually ensure that we were able to get through the early stages of the remediation in a really high quality and effective way. And I think the team has done a great job at making it a little bit more broadly across that entire Consumer group. I think we see that in the core trends. And of course once we establish that, we continue to see Consumer as a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And, as Jorge and \u2013 as you saw when we did the Medical Device and Consumer Investor Relations Review now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands. And we are really pleased to see performance, for example, LISTERINE up 7%, OTCs up 6%, analgesics within OTCs were up over 13%. And then in beauty, you saw about a 9% lift with really strong performance from NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter, whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was H\u00cdPOGLOS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions to our existing portfolio and will likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of the portfolio. And as we said for some time, whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at, tuck-ins, we look at mid-size deals. We'll look at large deals. Of course, the tuck-in strategy, particularly in Pharma \u2013 actually in all of our segments, Medical Device and Consumer, are those that, where we feel that we can create the most value. But we do think that there's other opportunities to create value as well in, again, in mid and larger deals. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very decisive about how we do it, and ultimately try to better serve patients and consumers. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just I guess on a broader note, I guess now that Consumer has turned the corner and has done well with the remediations, is that now a platform that, as you said, is more ready for acquisitions? I know Medical Devices is in the midst of their restructuring. Is that how we should think about it? And I have a follow-up for Dominic. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Look, we believe that, mission one was really focusing on the core business as we said. And I do feel that Consumer like all of our businesses we're pleased. We're never completely satisfied. And they made a lot of progress on the core, and so we would expect, again, in a very thoughtful, disciplined way to continue to do additions when we think they're right. But we would look for the same thing in our other segments, as well. And by the way, we're pleased with the progress that we've seen in our Medical Device group over the last quarter as well. I mean, if we look at the restructuring, I think overall that team is on track. They're doing actions to strengthen their go-to-market model to accelerate their pace of innovation. They're prioritizing some additional platforms and geographies and all while streamlining some operations but really keeping very high quality standards. We think they're on track with a plan that they articulated earlier in the year and we're confident that as they move through this, they will be not only a stronger but a more innovative and a more efficient business. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And, Dominic, for the rebate from pharma, should we think about that as flowing through this quarter, or was that mainly reinvested? Because I know there was a higher rate of R&D this quarter? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, the way to think about it maybe, Kristen, is that it's a year-over-year change in about $140 million sales level. So obviously some of that drops through to bottom line, and you're right, we do also take the opportunity to invest. Investments in R&D really are related to progress in the pipeline regardless of whether these gross-to-net adjustments would be available. But another way to think about it is that we're now at a point where these actualizations of prior estimates, our current reserves are \u2013 a significant portion of them are current because data has been coming in recently. So I wouldn't expect similar type of adjustments going forward. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks very much, and again, Louise, congratulations. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Matt. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Matt. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks to everybody for taking the questions. A lot of folks on the call. I'll try to keep it to one and one follow-up. Alex, while we've got you here, just one strategic question. And I don't know if this is consistent with what you're seeing or where you think things are going, but on Devices, what we've seen is a lot of these new innovations in structural heart in particular, some of the bundled payment initiatives seem to be driving more volumes to sort of higher volume centers, larger networks, potentially augmented by outpatient centers. It's early in some of these initiatives, but that seems to be directionally where things are headed. And first, love to get your sense as to whether you think that's where things are going as well? And if so, how J&J is positioned on the Device side to better support these kinds of trends. And then I had one follow-up. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Matt. Thank you very much for the question. Over the past three years or four years, I think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking and in our projections about the likely increase in consolidation among providers and hospitals, particularly here in the United States, and just broader healthcare systems. And as systems feel continuing pricing pressure, we think that will manifest itself by them having consolidation. I think we've seen those trends. And I think they're clearly starting an effort to try and be as effective and as efficient as possible. So we do believe that that will be a longer secular trend that's going to continue. That's why we believe having a diverse and enough critical mass in our Medical Device portfolio is so important going forward. We see it in the way that expectations are changing among decision makers, including not only surgeons but also people in procurement and other C-suite executives and administrators in hospital systems. And we think as a result of that, we'll be very well-positioned. Particularly when you think about our Surgical franchise, our Orthopedics franchise. We've also been consistently saying that we're extremely pleased with the performance of our Cardiovascular unit, particularly our EP Group, Biosense Webster. I mean, once again this quarter they delivered over 18.5% growth with great innovation and great execution. But we also realize that that's an area where we'll continue to look for the right kind of additions, organically and inorganically, to ensure that we're properly positioned going forward. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. Thank you. And then on another topic that we spent a lot of time on I guess over the past year and we're now a quarter away from what looks like the competitive launch in the U.S., biosimilar side on REMICADE. Without asking you to tip your hand, of course, \u2013 I'd love to get a sense as to, can you \u2013 are there steps you can take \u2013 given your portfolio and your relationship with these payers and networks, are there steps you can take to sort of stop \u2013 I don't know what the right word is \u2013 potentially offset some of the potential impact or get ahead of some of the potential impact through some of the contracts that you're talking with these folks about? And I think you know the question I'm asking, and I'm sure you're not going to get into a ton of detail. But any color would be helpful as to the extent your ability to contract around that event. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matt. Look, as we look at the landscape going forward, we fully predict that generics in biosimilars are going to be part of the competitive landscape. And look, we think that that is essential for the healthcare system. We think in the long run, it's actually a benefit for very innovative-focused companies because that's the only way you can relieve pressure over the long term. Of course, that's predicated upon the market and companies respecting intellectual property. It's very important to produce the right scientific information, so that we're guaranteeing patient safety and understanding the important clinical differences between some of these compounds, as they may or may not manifest themselves. And so we projected them. As we look at our strategic plan, we think they will be there. But we also feel that's why it's so important to keep innovating with new product launches going forward. And it's also critical to establish a strong critical mass in terms of products but also expertise and clinical data and information in certain platforms. And so for us in the immunology platform, we're very proud of the extensive track record that REMICADE, the TNF-alpha compound has had, and what it continues to do. We'll continue to defend our intellectual property around it. But at the same time if you look at compounds like STELARA and SIMPONI; not only have they both generated in excess of 30% growth this quarter, but we've also produced additional data that we think is going to be very important to patients and physicians in how they adopt these products. And these are already multi-billion-dollar platforms for Janssen and Johnson & Johnson. And then when you compound that with sirukumab and guselkumab again an IL-6 and IL-23 approach where we know there's a lot of patient variability, we think that's important. Also as we look at REMICADE itself, we know that there's about 2.4 million patients who've been treated with the compound. We know that about 70% of them in fact are getting good relief and good effects. We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive response from the therapy. And we also know that when we contract across the Janssen and Johnson & Johnson portfolio that it provides us a very important position with larger healthcare systems and networks. So that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we plan for it going forward. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Alex. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Good morning, and thanks for all the help over the years, Louise, and congratulations. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask a question to Dominic first. Just the operating margin performance again kind of beat our expectations. You reiterated your guidance for the year on the operating margin on expansion side of things. But I just wanted \u2013 there're multiple drivers of operating margin expansion, and there is \u2013 you had a program in place, I think you announced a couple of years ago, and just started to ramp last year of about $1 billion in cost savings by 2018 that was exclusive of the Medical Device restructuring plan. I just wanted to get a sense of the contribution to operating margin expansion this year, and if we're still in the very early innings and whether we should see stronger benefit from that cost savings plan as well as the Medical Device restructuring initiative in 2017 and 2018. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Josh, you're right. There are many factors that contribute. I mean, GP is one, so we continue to see good manufacturing efficiencies and cost improvements across the supply chain. That's a major initiative we've had ongoing for quite some time. So we saw some of that benefit this quarter, and we expect that we'll see it going forward as well. In the selling, marketing, administrative line, that's where you see the benefits of the program you're referring to where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings through 2018. That program is on track. We're seeing the savings. We're also making some investments. As the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program, but in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and they'll have more of an impact. And then also as you mentioned, the Medical Device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the two that I just mentioned earlier, and we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want to also accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those three areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I mentioned earlier, greater than 200 basis points, and halfway through the year we feel very good about our ability to achieve that. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Excellent. I just wanted to ask a follow-up maybe for Alex and Louise. Just you commented on utilization levels in the U.S. and procedure volumes, and you experienced just a modest apples-to-apples in selling days from sequentially modest deceleration in knees and hips and spine in the Ortho segment. Is there anything specific to Q2 that you're seeing in the marketplace that you can comment on? Thanks for taking the questions. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, look, overall \u2013 and thank you for the question. Overall I think we saw solid growth in both knees and hips. I think we were at about 4.5% in knees, about 5%, 5.5% in hips. And we think that that's continued pickup from the ATTUNE launch, and the Corail Hip. So I would say that, consistent with what we're seeing in the broader market, consistent with what we're seeing in our business, we're seeing positive growth in that area. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And for the O-U.S. business, there was about an additional 1.5 days of selling days in the second quarter. And in the first quarter we had additional selling days in the U.S. business, as a reminder on that one. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital markets. Please proceed with our question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Joanne. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for taking the question. I appreciate the commentary on the volumes, but I was curious if you can give us commentary on pricing, and also with the April 1 implementation of the bundled payment program in the United States, if you're seeing any impact from that. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. So we talk about pricing on a Johnson & Johnson basis, and overall pricing is modest in the quarter. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I would say, Joanne, that we haven't seen the impact yet in the particular new mechanism that you just described. As Louise pointed out, pricing overall for the quarter, year-over-year growth due to pricing is very, very modest in our results. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And I can provide some further color on hips and knees in the U.S. price mix, if you'd like. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That would be wonderful, thank you so much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So the second quarter for the hips was about 2.2% negative price mix together, and this is U.S. only. And for knees it was about 2.6% negative. And that's similar trends to what we've seen consistently over time. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. And then my second question had to do more with Vision Care. We saw a real difference between what was happening in the U.S. and what's OUS sales, and you commented on rebates. Is that the replacement program for UPP that we're seeing in that U.S. impact? Thanks for taking the questions. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So it's a customer reward program that we have implemented. And what we have booked in the second quarter is the year to date because it was implemented in the second quarter but it applies to the full year sales. So in the U.S., if you normalize it for the half that applied to the first half, the U.S. is up about 6% on a like basis. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, we continue to be very pleased with what we're seeing in the turnaround in our Vision Care business as well. If we look at the early demand signals that we're seeing, it continues to give us confidence that we're gaining share. We continue to launch into beauty, astigmatism, reusables, along with a number of other new launches and line extensions. And frankly, the team is also really executing well. So we're encouraged by the opportunity that we see in Vision Care as we move through the rest of 2016. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : And next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning. Good morning. And, Louise, I echo the sentiments, so best of luck in the future. My question is for Alex and for Dominic. And I asked a similar question on the last quarterly call because I continue to be surprised that J&J is not doing more with its cash, particularly on the M&A front. You've done both, but we haven't seen much in the way of meaningful acquisitions on devices and on pharma. And so my question is, the targets that you're having discussions with today, do they still have very unrealistic valuation expectations, and is that the reason why we haven't seen deals in devices and pharma? And then as a follow-up, you still have a bulk of your cash sitting outside the United States. Is that another reason why we haven't seen any meaningful acquisitions? Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Glenn. Consistent with what we said last time when you asked a very similar question, as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And although we're actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play, and willingness of the other party to do an acquisition at certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend. So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to do acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition at the right value, so we can improve returns for our shareholders. There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor, and that will take time and we're patient with that. And then we'll see how the market evolves over time, or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas. And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in a tax-efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much as possible, only if it's tax efficient. But then obviously we can continue to borrow, and we have the ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value-creating for our shareholders. So we wouldn't let that hold us back. Should the acquisition be value-creating, we'd exercise our ability to borrow and do that acquisition. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just as a follow-up \u2013 oh, go ahead, Alex. Did you want to add something? Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Glenn. I guess what I would also say is look, I think that the M&A approach that we talked about in the past is a balanced one. If you look over the last 20 years, I think we've done about 124 deals. I think there's been about 13 or so that have been over $1 billion. The majority of these have been smaller. And frankly if you look at our Pharmaceutical performance, whether it's the partnerships that we have on a compound like IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, or others, I think the strategy has worked really well, and it's something that we'll continue to pursue. I think we have a lot of examples of that in Medical Devices and also Consumer. There's nothing that we would like more than to take a several hundred million dollar platform like Vogue and create the next multibillion-dollar platform as we see in things like NEUTROGENA and others. So all that being said, if/when we see larger opportunities present an opportunity to really create longer-term shareholder value, those are things we'd certainly be interested in, but we'll be particularly thoughtful about those. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just one quickly on REMICADE. I know Matt had asked a question on REMICADE, but you remain very confident that a biosimilar won't be launched in 2016. Has anything changed that you can reveal to us on the litigation front that gives you more confidence? Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Glenn, what we said is that our guidance does not assume any biosimilar launch in 2016. There are ongoing developments in the litigation. There's a hearing scheduled for August related to the 471 patents. We'll have to see what the results of that hearing are, so we don't know that yet. There was also a ruling issued in relation to another biosimilar, not our biosimilar, which made it very clear when the 180-day waiting period applies. And for us, that 180-day waiting period extends to October 6. So obviously, there cannot be any launch before that date. And then as we've mentioned, we're continuously and vigorously defending our patent and will continue to do that. So whether or not a biosimilar launch happens is uncertain. But we have not included it in our guidance estimates. But as you know, our guidance of course is a range and between certain ranges of 3% to 4% in overall growth. So we feel confident about that in any event. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning and congrats, Louise. Once again. I echo others' sentiments. Just two quick questions, I know we're near the end. So, Dominic, I'm trying to reconcile revenue guidance just on the margin. So if I take the upside in the quarter plus the net impact of M&A, Vogue minus the API business, I get guidance should have come up $700 million, it's coming up around $300 million. Is that difference in the back half of the year largely an expectation for lower or minimal gross-to-net adjustments in the back half versus the first half? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Certainly as I mentioned earlier, the gross-to-net adjustments that we saw in the first half have now resulted in our overall estimates for these amounts as being largely current, greater than 90% current. So therefore, we wouldn't expect to have the same level of those kinds of adjustments going forward, David. That's right. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful, and maybe two questions on Consumer, one for Alex and one for Dominic. Dominic, just to start with you on margins, I think we left the Analyst Day feeling that Consumer margin outlook was probably conservative. But if I look at the reported results in the quarter, you're well ahead of expectations in pursuing that pure base 20% Consumer margin. So how do we think about that? Is that simply one-time in nature, or is it much more likely now you reasonably exceed your targets either in time or magnitude here in Consumer? And then a quick follow-up for Alex in Consumer. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure. As you know, we were committed to this. And as Jorge Mesquita said in the Business Review Day, he was personally committed to making it happen, and we're very pleased to see that they're off to a great start. Whether they exceed the overall benchmark level in a shorter amount of time, we'll wait to see because obviously we want to see them invest behind brands and keep the momentum up in the business as well. But they're obviously off to a great start. We were confident that they would be able to do it and they've done a great job and we're confident they'll continue to do a great job in improving margins. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Alex, I think many investors have felt that Consumer was sort of kept in the closet here the last several years and clearly the last six months. The company's working hard to sort of show the Consumer franchise to a greater extent both margins and growth. My question's more on growth. If I ex-out Venezuela in the quarter, Consumer did about 5% growth. I felt like the messaging from Jorge and others was that this business could be sort of an upper single-digit grower with obviously expanding margins. What is your sense on that 5% number ex-Venezuela? I mean, do you feel confident here that Consumer is stable and can improve from these levels? Thank you. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, thank you very much. And again let me reiterate. We're really pleased with the performance that we continue to see in the Consumer group. And literally from quarter to quarter, it continues to improve in not only its core performance but market share and a number of other areas. We feel like the majority of the platforms right now we're actually gaining share. At the same time, we realize we've got some areas such as baby, such as China, where we need to do a better job and the team is focusing on that in addition to the margin improvement that Dominic was talking about earlier. But overall, our goal is to grow faster than the market. We think we currently are. It's something that we want to do and accelerate as we go forward. And I'm very confident that Jorge and his team have got the strategies and are now executing in a manner that's going to allow them to do just that. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Danielle. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Danielle. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Danielle. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Louise, we're really going to miss you. Question for you, Alex, just higher level. Sorry to do this, but following up on the M&A commentary, some of your competitors have been acquiring scale, most recently, Abbott and St. Jude. And I know J&J is already in a competitively advantageous position given your current product lines, but cardiovascular is an area where you're specifically under-scaled relative to some of those other competitors, and I was just wondering if you could comment on whether you think it's important to build scale within cardiology to continue to be a major competitor in med tech, or if you think there's other areas where J&J is already positioned and will continue to focus on? I'm just trying to think about the different subsectors within med tech, where you'll focus most. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Danielle. Look, consistent with what we said previously, we do think that there's an opportunity for expansion in cardiovascular. And for us, really it started several years ago when we made the decision to exit the stent business. We did the divestment of Cordis, which I think the team executed really well. And we think now the greater focus that we have, what you're seeing as a result of that, frankly, is better growth not only in our cardiovascular business, the Biosense Webster, but across the greater medical \u2013 Hospital Medical Device business that we have. But we know that going forward, other areas in cardiovascular ranging from valves to structural heart to others could definitely be opportunities. But we're going to continue to see how the technology evolves, how the markets evolve. And fortunately, I think we're positioned in a way that gives us a lot of different opportunities. At the same time, I would say that there are other areas in Medical Devices that we remain interested in. We talked about the vision care area. It's one where we have a very strong contact lens platform, but we think that there's opportunities, be it back of the eye, surgery and other spaces, that business could be augmented. And we'll continue to look for other thoughtful plays in orthopedics as well as in general surgery that offer growth opportunities and help us better address areas of unmet medical need as well. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, great. That's so helpful. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much for the question. And, Louise, I'm really going to miss talking to you. You've been extremely helpful over the years. Dominic, I'm sorry to belabor the gross to net adjustment, but I'm unclear as to how it occurred and what it means. And I think more importantly, these are all categories, REMICADE, STELARA, SIMPONI, ZYTIGA, which are crowded categories. And can you comment on what's happening with respect to gross to net, the gap between gross to net and how it's changed over the last year or two? If it has changed at all, are you able to take the same sort of list price that you had before without having to pay a higher rebate? If you could just kind of comment on that generally. And then also my follow-up question relates to INVOKANA. Sales again were continuing to be very strong. You're showing nice improvements in market share. What are your expectations for the whole SGLT2 class? I'm sure you've paid attention to the FDA panel meeting on Jardiance and whether or not Jardiance will get a superior label with respect to CV mortality reduction. And if it does get that label update, what that might mean to INVOKANA going forward? Thanks very much. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Jami, let me take the first question on gross to net, and then Alex will cover the SGLT2 commentary. So you asked how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price and those sorts of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know. Everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be, and then of course we'll actualize them once actual data is submitted. Recently, that actual data has been more timely, and in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends, so we're able to not only actualize prior period amounts, but we're also able to estimate better, what the ultimate gross to net variation will be going forward. With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we've said this before, we price \u2013 we think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below, substantially below, the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happens. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business, and the overall realization of gross price to net price, that delta is expanding, I would say, over time. And therefore, as I said, now we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on. And as I mentioned, we don't expect to see significant adjustments to this magnitude. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So you're saying the gap is going to continue to grow but you overestimated the growth of that gap and that, therefore, is the adjustment, but big picture you expect the gap to grow? Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : That's right. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Jami, regarding INVOKANA and the class, look first of all, we are pleased with the performance, the continued performance of INVOKANA in the market. I mean, it remains the number one SGLT2 in the U.S., both in new and total scripts. I think we've got between 9 million and 10 million prescriptions that have already gone out since launch. That being said, we still think that there is a good opportunity for growth in INVOKANA. It's got a very strong clinical profile that's well documented, strong access across managed care, and look we're confident that given the experience that HCPs have had with it, combined with its profile, it's going to continue to grow. Regarding the broader issues around class, look we think that it's really good news, frankly, for Type 2 patients given some of the news that's coming out about CV benefits and really regardless of the eventual decision by the FDA regarding potential claims for other agents, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our CANVAS program that'll be coming out in about a year. And we'll have to see if these ongoing CV outcome trials validate some of the current perceptions of KOLs regarding the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors across the drug class. We'll see. But overall, we think it's good news for patients. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. And we'll take two more questions and then have some closing remarks from Alex. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats again to you, Louise. Just following up on Jami's question on the gross to net commentary, just I don't think you touched on this, but specifically on immunology it seems like a lot of those products, in particular, saw that benefit. Is there anything that you're seeing in that specific market? And maybe causing the difference there to be greater than what you see in the other therapeutic areas? And then one other unrelated just on IMBRUVICA, came in a little bit lighter than what we were expecting, obviously a lot of good data and a lot of growth ahead. But maybe if you could just comment on the trends you're seeing there? And also, I guess it's been about a year now since a new partner on that product with Pharmacyclics and AbbVie. Just the dynamics in that partnership and how you see that relative to what you're seeing previously with Pharmaceuticals. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Let me take \u2013 Vamil, there's nothing substantially different between biologics and others, other than the biologics products tend to have a longer delay in terms of receiving the information. So therefore, there may be more adjustments related to those products in any particular period. But other than that, there's no other significant trend that we're seeing that's any different than what we see overall in the market. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And look, regarding IMBRUVICA, we're very pleased with the continued launch uptake that we see with it. It continues to be strong, good increase versus last year. And look, IMBRUVICA is also maintaining really good total patient market leadership in CLL, line two plus, mantle cell lymphoma as well as WM in the U.S. We've had additional approvals of line indications done in other markets as well. So we continue to be pleased with the performance and look forward to getting out additional information and additional indications on the compound. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, and just on the quarter, there's additional \u2013 we have a patient assistance program and there's a little bit of a bump in that. So that's probably the trend difference that you see. Last question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please proceed with our question. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Jayson. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Hi, Louise. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'll be quick. Just to clarify and kind of follow up on an earlier question, U.S. Med Device growth in the quarter decelerated from first quarter levels. International growth accelerated. There was quite a big difference in growth in these two geographies. It sounds like this is more a function of selling days with no real change in the operating environment. Is that a fair characterization? Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : So in the OUS, we have an additional 1.5 selling days on average. That contributes to the OUS growth about 220 basis points. But on top of that, we're seeing strong market growth in China. We have some strong markets in Russia, Australia in the hip. We're seeing nice growth in the Corail, also seeing some nice growth in ATTUNE. So it's a combination of both the selling days, but if you strip out the 220 basis points for selling days O-U.S., you're really seeing really nice strong growth in both hips and knees O-U.S. Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Jayson, one thing I would add to that is when we're talking about the Medical Device business, obviously there's some dynamics in diabetes and some dynamics that we've talked about earlier with Vision Care with customer loyalty program. So if you look at the hospital-based medical device business and you exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, that growth did accelerate. So second quarter growth at about 4.7% and first quarter growth at about 4.2%. So on the base Hospital Medical Device business, overall we're seeing accelerated growth. Louise Mehrotra - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. We'll have some final remarks from Alex. Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. And as I noted earlier, look, we're really pleased with the continued momentum as evidenced by our increased guidance for both sales and earnings for the full year 2016. Look, I really believe that some of the clear strategic choices that we've been making, a really strong focus on execution, combined with an incredibly-talented group of leaders that I'm honored and humbled to be able to work with every day at Johnson & Johnson are enabling us to really deliver extraordinary achievements and results that we've just been able to share with you and to really build on the success of Johnson & Johnson going forward. So thank you for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year and I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Caruso - EVP and CFO Analysts : Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Michael Weinstein - J.P. Morgan David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Matthew Miksic - UBS Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the review of our business results for the third quarter of 2016. Joining me on the call today are, Dominic Caruso, Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Bill Hait, Global Head of Pharmaceutical Research & Development. A few logistics before we discuss the results. This review is being made available via Webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web-site at investor.jnj.com. I will begin today's presentation by briefly reviewing the third quarter sales and earnings results for the corporation and sales results for each of our three business segments. Next, Joaquin and Bill will provide an update on our Pharmaceutical business, specifically highlighting how our focus on innovation to address unmet medical needs translates to current and future strong performance. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement, and discuss guidance for 2016. Lastly, we will open the call to your questions. We expect today's call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson Web-site, as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our Web-site. I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and the Company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made here today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web-site. During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgement of those relationships. I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. In the U.S., sales were up 6.7%, while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5% comprised of 1.7% operational growth partially offset by a negative impact of currency exchange rate of 0.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reversed in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2%, while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points, and outside the U.S. 70 basis points. Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.53, versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8% respectively as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%. Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentage this quarter for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in women's health. Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call. OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago. Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue and NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. OUS results were driven by stocking of DABAO products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continued to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care/Other and Women's Health categories. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0% and outside the U.S. up 7.0%. Contributors to growth included; immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA and XARELTO. In immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels, accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of the export sales. In neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA achieved strong results with worldwide sales growth of 21%, due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. In oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience a strong adoption in Canada and the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of worldwide pharmaceutical sales growth. Turning to cardiovascular and metabolics, XARELTO continued strong share performance with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher co-pay program costs in the quarter. While the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with the primary care. I'll now review the results of the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7%, with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points. Growth was driven by Electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by General Surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine. Continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results. Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide General Surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in women's health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continued to impact Diabetes Care. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin? Joaquin Duato : Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with a vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains. We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential $1 billion-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver a strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics. Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and eight breakthrough therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation. Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market $1 billion-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing and six of them are growing double-digits. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth. First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential $1 billion-plus NMEs, planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate five to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. Since 2015, our expectations on these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed, delivering higher value than originally anticipated. DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We're also investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, Niraparib. Finally, Esketamine is already in Phase 3 and recently received a second breakthrough therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly. Finally, it is important to note that these three strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 timeframe. The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near term line extensions and NME launches will more than offset upcoming headwinds including those anticipated for REMICADE. We are fully prepared to execute our focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of our U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing and we believe any commercial launch of our biosimilar remains at risk. Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch. I am confident in our strategy for three reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive and REMICADE's ASP is already significantly lower than the list price. Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio. Our immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI too. Additionally, we plan to file two line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together, with the recent submissions of sirukumab for approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in rheumatology. Turning to psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential $1 billion plus brands, guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing. Finally, moving to gastroenterology, the most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at one year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019. Moving now to cardiovascular and metabolics, INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading SGLT2 inhibitor and the third-largest non-insulin Diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone. As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer co-pay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to readout in mid-2017. XARELTO is another market leader in our cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world data set, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded co-pay. These considerable achievements are just the start. Approximately 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications. Additionally, there are eight new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pool could increase more than five-fold. Turning to neuroscience, INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Not only is INVEGA TRINZA the fastest growing LAT in the U.S., it has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S. Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions. When Prezista first launched, it was part of a six-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, Darunavir Single Tablet Regimen, will reduce this number to one, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect two Rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead\u2019s TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth post 2019. Finally, let's move to our fastest growing therapeutic area, oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursing 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional six indications have been approved and we anticipate an additional seven new registrations ahead, four of which have $500 million plus potential. Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will ascertain a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA's leadership in oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only three months after its launch, DARZALEX became the number one prescribed therapy in fourth line or later multiple myeloma. From a launch aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been approved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide. Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional five Phase 3 trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma. What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant. Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019, even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics. In my six years leading our pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands, 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential, and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019. It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver these groundbreaking treatments. Bill? William Hait : Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait and I am the Global Head of Research & Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson Innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies. Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry leading results. Our five end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and lifecycle management. This structure produces a focused seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling translatable science. These five therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas. Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external Scientific Advisory Board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our Centers of Excellence, including biotechnology, medicinal chemistry, diagnostics, clinical operations and most recently oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios. Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into three categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top two categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market. Janssen has achieved considerable success and we are poised to continuously deliver near and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as eight breakthrough therapy designations. For four consecutive years, we have been named the Innovation Leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice to the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list. Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years, as well as the work on new convenient HIV combinations, the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector as well as new chewable forms of Mebendazole for children with worm infestations. As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019 we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with the potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 LEs anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion. In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024. We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered three new product approvals and filings with a fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions. Now, let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our five therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. Our hem-malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received four FDA breakthrough therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for front-line use based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 Study published in the December 15th issue of The New England Journal. As shown in this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival. DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received two FDA breakthrough therapy designations and was approved almost four months ahead of its PDUFA date in double refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Velcade and dexamethasone or Revlimid and dexamethasone respectively produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to that of VelDex or RevDex alone. Both of these studies were published in The New England Journal. This month, the FDA granted priority review for Daratumumab in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone or Bortezomib and Dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma with a PDUFA date in February 2017. Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by ZYTIGA, the first CYP17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and is approved for both pre and post chemotherapy indications. Furthermore, we are developing ARN-509, now known as apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As seen in these figures, apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer every 12 weeks of treatment. The maximal PSA response, shown in the right-hand figure, was achieved in 94% of patients. Earlier this year, we licensed Niraparib from TESARO to obtain a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects, for use in combination with ZYTIGA or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase 2 clinical trials and currently planned to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results to patients with prostate cancer for many years to come. While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last five years, we invested in four critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of action. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including eight that are in the clinic. Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune-mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid and lymphoid populations including a previously unrecognized super-suppressor CD38 positive T-reg population as well as activation of CD8 and CD4 positive effect to T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond hem-malignancies and solid tumors. Our immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12, IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S., received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, and offers new options for adult patients with IBD. Guselkumab is a first-in-class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo and superiority compared with the anti-tumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive Guselkumab, adalimumab or a placebo followed by Guselkumab in a 2-2-1 ratio. Patients treated with Guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of attaining a PASI 90 score compared to that of patients treated with adalimumab or placebo at week 16, and the advantage over adalimumab was sustained through week 48. The high degree of efficacy of Guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes Guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL-17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance Guselkumab into Phase 3 for patients with psoriatic arthritis. Neuroscience is a historically strong area for Janssen since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleagues developed haloperidol, the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance with this difficult to treat patient population, most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA in every three-month injectable formulation. Today, we focus on neuroscience investment in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicidality and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally delivered enantiomer of ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder, with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months. There is an alarming increase in suicides, both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. As shown in this slide, Esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within four hours and sustained this effect for over three weeks, leading to its second FDA breakthrough therapy designation. Infectious diseases is one of our most exciting and important area of investment for future growth where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% SVR12 in patients with genotype 1 with both an eight and six-week duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO, AL-335 and odalasvir. Based on these exceptional data, we are moving to 3DAA regimen into late development studies. Our cardiovascular and metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Bayer respectively. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value to these two first-in-class drugs. With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, VTE prevention in medically ill patients, infrainguinal peripheral artery disease, VTE prevention in cancer patients and in acute coronary syndrome. We anticipate readouts from two INVOKANA cardiovascular outcome studies by mid-2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in the treatment of patients with diabetes. We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and pre-diabetes. In summary, at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drives value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing a cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approvals and FDA breakthrough therapy designations, and we are one of the fastest growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies. We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last five years, 2011 to 2016, and eight breakthrough therapy designations. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential. We have approximately 40 planned line-extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. Finally, we take pride in delivering years of life saved and better quality of life for our first Credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products. Now, before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference let me leave you with the current overview of our pipeline across our five therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the Company's financial results. Dominic J. Caruso: Thank you, Bill and Joaquin, and good morning everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we made good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong end market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see why we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward. I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're pleased with our overall results. As you know, we had a strong start to the year, and as a result, last quarter we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses. In our Consumer business, we continued to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw slowdown in many markets with category growth rates in 2016 about half of the category growth rates we saw in Q3 of 2015. As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015, as we discussed at that time, due to re-launches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of the larger retailers this past quarter. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, and this overall impact with trade inventory reductions, overall Consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trends of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward. In Medical Devices, consistent with some recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admissions and procedure rates during the mid summer months. Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity, and in fact the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. Additionally, we are very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double-digits as Joe mentioned earlier. Overall, Hospital Medical Devices operational growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%. So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015 our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days that we saw in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to accelerate our growth and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter of 2016. Our sales were above analyst estimates, as were earnings, due to significantly higher pre-tax operating margins. As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 pre-tax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest in our business and we remain comfortable with that forecast for the full year as we continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our Medical Devices businesses while also investing in growth. As you know, in September we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So, for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings and is not expected to impact our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. We are excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world-leading ACUVUE contact lens business, will help us become a broad-based leader in vision care. Now, I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. So I'll now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2016. Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3%, and when we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact the Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. If you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same, as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. Now let's take a few moments to talk about other items of the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points, mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts, partly offset by a favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, due to overall good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points, due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline. Our pre-tax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, our pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit, less selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and less R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year, and through nine months we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability, consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year. Interest expense, net of interest income, was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter, compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million, compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period which included a higher level of gains from divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%, compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit which was passed by Congress late last year and it reflects the current mix of our businesses and the impact from a new accounting standard relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation which we discussed in our call in July. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will note a significant improvement in margins for the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical businesses. Last year, our Consumer business benefited from a gain on the sale of SPLENDA and you're seeing that reflected in their lower margin this quarter, although still at very healthy rates. As you can see on the next slide, on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our Consumer margin and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full-year 2016 as compared to 2015. Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pre-tax operating profit margin which I noted earlier more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. Now, I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you find difficult to forecast. Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. This is a slight tightening of the range. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains or losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corp., divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a gain ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate. And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance primarily due to a higher level of income in lower tax jurisdictions. Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same, whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S. Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition, divestitures and hepatitis C, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015 which we mentioned earlier. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies had not significantly fluctuated since our last update. So, after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of positive 2% to 3% or a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, consistent with our previous guidance. And now turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%, and this is a narrowing of the range. If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range. Finally, just a reminder of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture, and based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year. In closing, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full-year growth for 2016. Specifically, we are expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level than we experienced last year on a comparable basis. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remained strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share, with a growth rate of 8% to 9%, and we are very well-positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth. Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe for the Q&A portion of the call. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Dominic. Michelle, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to participate in the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So Dominic, I wanted to focus on the 2017 puts and takes. Dominic, in our Healthcare Conference in September, you said the only real delta from 2016 to 2017 is the rate at which biosimilar REMICADE could penetrate the market, assuming Pfizer launches at risk and you don't think the penetration will be dramatic. I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017 at a similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are, is that the right interpretation and what gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for Neupogen captured about 7% of the market in year one. Would you expect Inflectra penetration to be less than that? Any color that you can give on the expected penetration would be helpful, and I did have one follow-up on Pharma. Thank you. Dominic J. Caruso: Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. I think the way you characterized it is accurate, that excluding the impact of any biosimilar launch, we would expect the business to grow at a rate similar to what we saw this year in the Pharma business overall, as well as I think we will see improved performance in the Medical Devices business and we're seeing continued share gains in the Consumer business. So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January. We do think that the rate of penetration for a biosimilar will be modest. I know several reasons for that. As we talked about before, 70% of the patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor. And we're already in a highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapies, as you know. Before any comments on Neupogen, Joaquin, anything else you want to add to overall penetration of biosimilars? Joaquin Duato : We are confident that we have our readiness plan for our biosimilar launch in the U.S. What we have seen internationally in markets like Australia, Brazil where we market REMICADE is that our volume share has been in excess of 90%. So that is consistent with what you described. We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before, there's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide, there is no interchangeability and there is a clear patient and physician preference. So it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in REMICADE to switch it. So that is 70% of the patients. At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program which will prove to be a market differentiator and we are ready to compete in every channel trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well-prepared to face the biosimilar, and as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition. Dominic J. Caruso: And Larry, I'm not sure whether Neupogen is a good analog or not. I mean, who knows, right. Obviously, we have Europe, we have a biosimilar in Europe that Merck is responsible for marketing I think there over about a two-year period. Merck has retained about 75% share. So that's one analog. You had a follow-up question you said on Pharma. Larry Biegelsen : Yes, maybe for Joaquin. So on INVOKANA, I saw in the presentation that you expect to present the CANVAS and the CANVAS-R data in mid-2017. So my questions are, are you going to present CANVAS and CANVAS-R separately before mid-2017 and did you have any plan to issue a press release with top line results before the presentation? And lastly, what's your confidence that we'll see a similar cardiovascular benefit as we did with EMPA-REG OUTCOME as well as the lack of significant amputation risk? Thanks for taking the questions. Joaquin Duato : INVOKANA remains the leading SGLT2, as I have described in the conference call, and to talk about CANVAS and CANVAS-R and the cardiovascular benefit, I'm going to pass the question to Bill. William Hait : This is Bill Hait. So we plan to evaluate CANVAS and CANVAS-R together as one net analysis. We're in discussions right now on the degrees of statistical confidence with the FDA. We have very strong reason to suspect based on CANVAS that the combination will give data very similar to what was reported with EMPA. Operator : The next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : I was just going back to I guess REMICADE and just again through the pipeline I guess, what are some of the things that you feel confident on to the extent that the biosimilar could take I guess greater share than what you are expecting that could start to fill-in I guess some of the gaps from that perspective? Joaquin Duato : I described part of the reasons for optimism during my conversation before. We not only feel that we are going to be able to grow in the face of biosimilars in the pharmaceutical business overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to grow our immunology franchise in the face of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the three segments, rheumatology, psoriasis and gastroenterology. In rheumatology, SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA is already leading in new-to-brand share in rheumatology in the U.S., and SIMPONI is gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file two line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017, and also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA and we plan to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that we're going to continue to grow in rheumatology. Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file Guselkumab that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV. We plan to file Guselkumab before the end of the year. So that's another reason why we feel real confident that we will continue to grow in psoriasis. And finally gastroenterology, which by the way for us is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in Crohn's disease and we are now launching it in the U.S. and we anticipate to be launching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason which we believe that we are going to be able to continue to grow in immunology. So overall, we have line extensions, we have continuous penetration and also we have the filing of sirukumab and Guselkumab in the second half of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan. Michael Weinstein : So Dominic, I wanted to just follow up on all the discussion on the Pharmaceutical business. You made some comments at an investor conference in September that caught my attention. You talked about the five major therapeutic categories the Company is in today, and you opened up I think for the first time that the potential of the Company would consider adding a new therapeutic category. Just want to get a sense of your interest in doing that, and maybe the rest of the team wants to chime in as well. Dominic J. Caruso: Sure, Mike. I remember that discussion pretty well. I just want to put it in the context for everyone. So this was a discussion about the success of our Pharmaceutical business, which has largely been driven by collaboration, licensing, co-development, et cetera, and not at all by any major acquisition, right. And the question that I got posed to me was, well, that's been very successful, why would you ever change that or is there any reason to consider a change in that strategy? And my comment was, to the extent we have five major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and we wanted to get into that therapeutic area and we felt we could add a lot to it based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly, that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessarily a licensing strategy but more of an acquisition type strategy. So it would enhance the overall portfolio of Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical business beyond the current therapeutic areas that we currently are in, and by doing that, that might require a more significant acquisition than we've been doing in the Pharma business. So that's the context for that. Joaquin Duato : What is important to remember is that our focus is in medical innovation, and therefore our areas in which we'll operate will depend on where science is going and our own internal capabilities on the development on the commercial side. So, from that perspective, we are constantly evaluating in which therapeutic areas we are in and its affluent situation. The focus is in transformational medical innovation and the actual therapeutic areas can change over time. Michael Weinstein : And so, is that \u2013 I mean, Dominic, that comment, is that just an indicator of that there is an open-end sort of interest in new therapeutic areas more so today than maybe in the last five years? Dominic J. Caruso: I think there's always an interest in new therapeutic areas where there is medical innovation where we think we can make a difference to patients in the health care system. So I'm not sure that that's changed dramatically, although over the last several years, we've built these very prominent disease strongholds within the therapeutic areas that we have today and obviously they take some time to build. Bill, any other comments on that? William Hait : In fact, to get to where we are today, we had to focus down from approximately 33 different diseases we were investing broadly but thinly to 11 diseases where we developed extremely deep expertise internally, from basic discovery right through launching, commercialization and market understanding, to where we are always considering first, is there a room for further massive innovation because of the development of transformational science or new knowledge that we can go after. And number two is, we become very familiar with adjacencies to the areas we are in, and if they look attractive, they are often the ones we take the hardest look at. So we are always looking to see if there's still massive innovation left to go in our disease areas and therapeutic areas and we're always looking closely at adjacencies. Operator : The next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Two questions, first for Joaquin and then Dominic, some commentary on Medical Devices utilization. So Joaquin, I found your commentary on the strategy to defend REMICADE pretty compelling. So, should we take from your comments that your existing strategy is sufficient or should we expect more proactive pricing strategies to emerge in 2017 and beyond? Joaquin Duato : Our strategy is three-pronged, as I described. The first one is the fact that we believe based on the track record of REMICADE and the lack of interchangeability, it's unlikely that patients are going to switch if they are stable. So that's a very important component for us. The second element is that we plan to compete in all channels, and in planning to compete in all channels, we are going to be utilizing innovative contracting and utilizing the full breadth of our portfolio. And then finally, we plan to utilize market differentiators such as patient assistance programs that are going to enable affordability. So with these three components, we feel confident that we are going to be able to have a very strong plan to face the biosimilar. The second element of that overall is what I just described before, what are the elements that lead us to believe that we'll continue to grow in immunology too, and I described the different line extensions and NMEs that we have in the three areas, rheumatology, gastroenterology and psoriasis. So combined, we feel strongly that we'll be able to continue to grow in immunology and overall the Pharmaceutical business will grow in the face of the biosimilars. David Lewis : Okay. So if you had to use price next year more aggressively, Joaquin, that would be an incremental surprise to you? Joaquin Duato : This is already a very competitive market as it is today. As you can imagine, there is already significant competition in the market today, both in the subcu area and in the IV area. So we believe that the level of discounting that is today makes it already a high bar for any new entrant. David Lewis : Thank you, very clear. And then Dominic, you made a series of comments on utilization. I just want to clarify both the near-term and kind of longer-term environment. So if I heard you correctly, it seems like there was some softening potentially in the Medical Devices business in the summer but that got better in September. I wonder if you could just help us out in terms of how you would characterize the environment here in September and entering into October. Is it stable with what you saw in the first half of the year or different? And then the second part of that question is, you also said, in 2017 you actually expect some improvement in the Medical Devices business, and maybe you could share with us your confidence level and the areas that you would expect to improve in 2017? Dominic J. Caruso: Sure. So what we saw, David, is that through published sources, many of which are from firms such as yours and many of the sell-side that publish, we saw actually utilization rates as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures with the first quarter of this year being the highest by far and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates were depicting or forecasting. And then the third quarter was even slower than the second quarter overall but with a very marked difference in September. So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months, and the rate of growth in September was actually faster than what we saw in the first quarter, which was the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect from the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well-chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you I'm sure have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures. Going into 2017, I expressed confidence in our Medical Devices business growing faster, and quite frankly, you know we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the Medical Devices sector and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the area that we focused the most on, the growth platforms and priority platforms, just this quarter they grew at 9%, and within those, three of those in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above market growth in 2017. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Just a follow-up on REMICADE, because Dominic, you said REMICADE, where the biosimilars would be a launch risk, so can you remind us what's next in the legal process? And then you also did a good job of discussing the impact you thought for the top line. Can you talk about the profitability of REMICADE today? Is this a drug that is still heavily marketed? I can't imagine there is a lot of R&D behind REMICADE. Dominic J. Caruso: A couple of things where we stand on the legal front, as you know we have an upcoming trial on the media related to the production of the biosimilar and that trial is scheduled for mid-February of 2017, and we're also appealing the ruling recently in the Massachusetts Court regarding the patent being invalid, and that will proceed. But we're also separately, and we had been involved in this process for quite some time, we're continuing the appeals process within the U.S. Patent Office and that process has several more steps to go. Joe, anything else you want to add to that? Joseph Wolk : Yes, just with some specific dates, Glenn. So the oral arguments in front of the PTO was heard on September 28. We expect that decision to be rendered anywhere from one to three months. In the courts, on the 471 patent, the final judgment just came from the bench on September 27. So that triggers the time in which we have to appeal, and we are going through that process now. Dominic J. Caruso: Okay, and with regard to profitability, obviously the product like REMICADE is an important product that obviously delivers significant profitability to the Company, but of course we have a number of new launches. We have some that are already launched and are progressing and rapidly growing and their relative cost does not grow at the rate of their sales growth, and overall we have to manage through this period of time when eventually when a biosimilar launches and a patent expires, we'll have to prepare ourselves for that in any event. So we are very well prepared to adjust accordingly, and as you know, our major focus always is to grow our sales at a rate faster than the rate in which our markets grow, so gain share, and then grow our earnings at a rate faster than sales. So that's the level at which we plan for each and every year. Glenn Novarro : So is there some restructuring that may come out over the next, announcements that may come out that could serve as an offset to REMICADE and any potential lost profitability? Dominic J. Caruso: We don't see any major restructuring related to the REMICADE situation on the horizon, Glenn, not at all. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Dominic, just a couple of questions for you. With the upcoming election, obviously it's been a major area of focus for healthcare investors. I'm just curious to your thoughts on Proposition 61, and as you know, I think that polls are showing that that actually might pass in the state of California, and just curious to know what you think the industry's response will be to that. And then secondly, I'm interested in your thoughts on the potential for an international tax reform as part of an infrastructure bill. Obviously, you would be huge beneficiaries of such a bill because of repatriation. Can you give us your thoughts on the likelihood of that happening? We had multiple discussions over the years about tax reforms, which never happens, maybe it will happen this time, just curious to know what your Washington folks are saying. And are we correct in assuming that if you were to do a large mega transaction adding that sixth tool to your Pharmaceutical division, are you more likely to wait until we get visibility on that or is your decision irrespective of potential legislation? Thanks. Dominic J. Caruso: Okay, Jami, let me take a minute and reverse a little. So whether or not we do a major transaction, we'll not be dependent on waiting for international tax reform. Obviously we have plenty of borrowing capacity and obviously any transaction that's done outside the U.S. would be an effective use of that OUS cash. And as you know, we've had the benefit of being able to structure transactions and effectively use our OUS cash in a tax efficient manner and we did that [indiscernible] transaction, we've done that recently with the two transactions that we recently announced. With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there is more [by-parts] [ph] to support now than there has been in the past. We think that often we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S. So that would be a positive. And we think that overall the climate for international tax reform post the election, quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so. And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition and we would prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes. Evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of, and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that. But Joaquin, any other thoughts on Prop 61? Joaquin Duato : Thank you. I mean as you were saying, Dominic, despite of the rhetoric about pharmaceutical pricing, it's always good to take some perspective on that. Pharmaceuticals represent 14% of total expenditures and we understand that we need to work with different stakeholders in order to try to manage our healthcare cost and we have advanced different ideas in that area as you were describing, Dominic, such as value-based contracting, and we need to work there in order to try to eliminate the regulatory barriers that do not help in that area. As far as Proposition 61, as an example of that rhetoric, as Dominic said, there are different groups that oppose that measure that includes even veteran groups and seniors and unions, the reason being it's unclear what the effects of Proposition 61 would be. It is clear that it would be difficult to operationalize and also would create some access barriers to patients. So overall, we don't see Proposition 61 as the right way to try to work on pharmaceutical pricing. We think it's a misguided action. Joseph Wolk : Being respectful of everyone's time, we'll take one more question, Michelle. Operator : Our final question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS. Matthew Miksic : I have one just quick clarification here on REMICADE, and then I have one on sort of capital allocation. So Dominic and Joaquin, if I could just make sure I'm understanding your comment on pricing and expected biosimilar competition. As you've gone through a number of times here on the call, the perception is that REMICADE pricing will face some kind of new downward pressure or abrupt pressure here as a result of this launch. It sounds like what you're saying is, the net price for the drug is already quite competitive. There will be obviously penetration but it doesn't sound like you're expecting to see any kind of significant or abrupt changes in pricing because of the competitive launch. Is that a fair characterization of what you're saying? Joaquin Duato : I think you got it right. All drugs, all medicines face price pressure. This is a particularly competitive market as it is today and we think that the price level is already quite competitive. So I think you characterized the situation quite right. I think the competition is going to move into other discussions such as other market differentiators, but the market is already quite competitive as it is. Matthew Miksic : Got it. Thank you. And then on capital allocation, just broadly speaking, Dominic, as we get this question quite often, you've made a number of comments throughout September about the kinds of things that you would be interested in strategically. You of course have said previously you'd be interested in ophthalmology and you are now pursuing that. If you wouldn't mind just for the record kind of ticking through your major divisions, and just I think you've touched on Pharma already, your preference there, but maybe on Consumer and Devices, just remind us the kinds of things that you are still interested in, their size and maybe area? Dominic J. Caruso: Matt, as a broadly-based company in human healthcare, we have an equal amount of interest across each of the businesses, and the way we compensate for that is basically looking at an appropriate risk-adjusted return for the particular assets that we're interested in, and that is the same even regardless of size. I mean, obviously size matters for a couple of reasons. One is that the asset may be well understood, the business may be well-penetrated, the premium required for the asset may be excessive, and therefore to generate value for our shareholders would be a challenge, but it doesn't mean we wouldn't try to do that or we wouldn't look for areas where that may in fact be available for us. So that would be across any of the businesses. Within Consumer and Medical Devices in particular, Consumer, just like we have in Pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands in emerging markets. A focus on over-the-counter medications and the beauty space particularly in Asia are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr.Ci:Labo in Japan where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia beyond Japan where it's currently marketed, just as an example of one. In the Medical Devices, as you know we have a very strong presence in orthopaedics and in general surgery. We keep looking for additional bolt-on acquisitions there and we have a very strong electrophysiology business in cardiovascular but there are other areas within cardiovascular that seem attractive in structural heart and other areas, but the valuation would be something we'd always consider. So we'd also be very disciplined about doing a transaction where the valuation seem pretty high, which is what they are today. Joseph Wolk : Thank you for the questions, Matt. That concludes the Q&A. I will now turn the discussion back over to Dominic for some closing remarks. Dominic J. Caruso: Okay. Thanks Joe. As I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our overall performance this quarter and we are tracking well through the second half of the year. I would like to thank Joaquin and Bill for their outstanding leadership and for the great presentation they gave this morning about the continued progress we are making in our pharmaceutical business. I would also like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to updating you on our full-year results in January. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to our review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.  Also on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our 2016 results as they demonstrate our track record of consistent and sustainable growth, exceeding financial expectations, and making progress on our long-term strategic drivers such as advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, implementing new commercial models in our Medical Device segment and enhancing market leadership for many of our iconic consumer brands. As we enter 2017, we are confident in our ability to continue producing solid results, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers and customers.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com where you can also find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and accompanying schedules. In terms of the agenda for today\u2019s discussion, after I review results for the Corporation and the three business segments, Alex will comment on our 2016 performance, share his perspectives on current dynamics in the healthcare and discuss key growth drivers for the company.  Dominic will then provide remarks on the income statement, and insights on our guidance for 2017. The remaining time will be available to answer your questions. We anticipate the call will last about 90 minutes.  Before we begin, please be aware that some of the statements made today during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Investor Relations section on our website for the Company\u2019s SEC filings, in particular, our 10-K that identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. We will also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not replacement for GAAP financial measures. Again, please refer to our press release and website for tables reconciling non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures.  A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Now, on to our results for the fourth quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales were $18.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 1.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 0.6%. In the U.S., sales were up 2.6%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1.9% as the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported OUS results by 1.3 points.  You may remember that during last year\u2019s fourth quarter call, we informed you that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week resulting in a few additional shipping days. Calculated of the 2015 base, these additional days negatively impacted growth in the fourth quarter 2016 by 480 basis points and the full year 2016 by 130 basis points.  Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the additional shipping days in 2015 operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 9.5% in the US and 5.6$ outside the US. I will provide you the same reference for each segment. For the full year 2016, consolidated sales were $71.9 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Operationally, full year sales grew 3.9% with currency having a negative impact of 1.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the additional shipping days in 2015, operational sales growth was 7.4% worldwide, 8.9% in the US, and 5.7% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.38, versus $1.15 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.58 representing increases of 7.9% and 9.7% respectively compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.4%. Regarding the full year, 2016 net earnings were $16.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.93. 2016 adjusted net earnings were $18.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.73, up 7.6% and 8.5% respectively versus full year 2015 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.4%. Please note, with respect to the extra days in 2015, as we stated last year, we did incur additional operating costs and as such the bottom-line impact was negligible. Dominic will provide further detail regarding earnings in his remarks. Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance. Highlighting items that build upon the slide you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While now part of the prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for full year 2016 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.4 billion growing 4.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, Venezuela, and the 2015additional shipping days adjusted sales growth was 7.6% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by global Beauty and OTC. Despite global consumer categories slowdown, we did continue to see strong consumptions for many of our products.  The Beauty franchise previously reported as Skin Care, includes the acquisitions of Vogue, NeoStrata and La Lumiere Light Mask, which in total contributed sales of $105 million or 12 points of growth for the franchise. The NEUTROGENA brand grew approximately 20% in the US. Also in the US, higher levels of retail stocking occurred in the quarter as we introduced new products and our Beauty products continued to gain share accounting for approximately eight points of growth. The OTC market growth rate was down [Audio Gap] and TYLENOL and ZYRTEC brands continue to gain market share. Analgesic adult share is currently 14.3%, and pediatric share is 49.8%, up approximately 1 point and 4 points respectively from Q4 2015. You may remember, in our third quarter call, we commented on lower inventory levels impacting growth, which we felt was temporary given our share gains.  In the fourth quarter, we did see a replenishment of that inventory to match the higher demand, as well as some seasonal build. This represented approximately eight points in the US OTC growth rate for the quarter. It is worth noting that the impact of demonetization in India and Article Regulation 94 regulation in China collectively represented a negative impact of approximately $50 million or 150 basis points on worldwide consumer growth. The impact from demonetization mostly impacted the Babycare franchise, while Article 94 primarily impacted the OTC business.  Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion grew 2.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the 2015 additional shipping days, adjusted sales growth was 9.9% worldwide. Oncology and Immunology were the primary contributors to operational growth. In Oncology, DARZALEX continued its strong growth trajectory with $200 million in sales for the quarter and in its first full year on the market reached sales of $572 million. DARZALEX maintains its leadership in line for multiple myeloma and we are seeing early signs of strong adoption for lines two and three following the recent approvals.  IMBRUVICA in the US across all lines of therapy gained approximately seven points of market share and the CLO market based on third quarter data is estimated to have grown better than 20%. Outside the US, we are seeing strong penetration in the G5 countries.  Worldwide ZYTIGA growth was down versus the fourth quarter of 2015 due to competition in the EMEA region as well as the higher utilization of patient assistance foundations in the US. In Immunology, the US market is estimated to have grown approximately 11%. STELARA in the US gained 3.6 points of market share in psoriasis versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and during the quarter, we received approval for the Crohn's disease indication in the EU to add to the US approval we\u2019ve received in September.  SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA benefitted in quarterly year-on-year comparisons by approximately four points from an inventory burn that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. REMICADE export business continues to see the impact of biosimilar competition. Regarding the at-risk biosimilar launch of Inflectra in the US, we have not observed any significant impact to-date. I\u2019ll conclude the pharmaceutical segment by commenting to some other key brands. INVOKANA, INVOKAMET sales were flat worldwide driven by continued uptake outside the US and modest declines in US share. XARELTO growth was driven by continued total prescription market share gains with the US now at 18%, up nearly two points from a year ago. Warfarin still makes up 53% of the market, but that is down from 61% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our long-acting injectable portfolio achieved strong results in all major regions due to increasing market share. I\u2019ll now review the Medical Device segment results. Worldwide Medical Device sales were $6.4 billion growing 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, Venezuela and the 2015 additional shipping days, adjusted sales growth was 4.7% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by our priority platforms, which as a reminder Electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Knees and Trauma, combined, that set of businesses grew approximately 4% when you adjust for the additional shipping days in Q4 2015, our priority platforms grew approximately 8% Electrophysiology grew 10% worldwide, as atrial fibrillation procedures are estimated to have grown 15% in the US and we see strong adoption of our newer OUS product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters. This business has grown double-digits 28 out of the last 29 quarters. Within the Advanced Surgery category, Endocutters growth was primarily driven by an uptake of new products in Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, specifically China and Japan. The Energy business benefited in quarterly year-on-year comparisons by approximately 7 points due to the business disruption we experienced on our HARMONIC ACE 7 Plus shares in Q4 2015.  Within Orthopedics, Knee growth was driven by continued uptake of ATTUNE outside the US. ATTUNE continues to gain volume in the US. Trauma, which now includes sales from the acquisition of Biomedical grew due to the TFNA mailing system uptake and the US market increasing approximately 5% based on our estimates. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in Orthopedics, but was partially offset by favorable mix. We are routinely asked in this forum about net price, so let me provide that to you now. For the quarter, net price in hips was negative 2.4%, knees negative 2%, trauma positive 3.2% and spine positive 2%.  Lastly, within the Medical Device segment, strong Vision Care results were driven by the introduction of new products such as ACUVUE VITA, and new offerings in the Beauty Lens category, as well as a trade inventory build, which accounted for approximately 3 points of growth.  That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2016. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the fourth quarter. It is now pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the line today. We are really pleased to be here sharing the strong results we delivered for 2016, not only do we meet our financial commitments to our investors and shareholders, we also delivered on the commitments and responsibilities defined in our Credo.  As all of you know, we have several important responsibilities outlined in our Credo. It compels us to meet our first responsibility to the doctors and nurses, mothers and fathers, and all others to use our products; to our employees, to our communities, in the world we live in, and it compels us to make a sound profit, experiment with new ideas and develop innovative programs. When we do all of this, our shareholders should realize a fair return.  In fact, we delivered a very fair return this year. Our total shareholder return for 2016 was a strong 15.3%, significantly exceeding our competitor composites as well as exceeding most major indices. And not only is that true for 2016, but I am very proud to say it\u2019s also the case over the last three, five, ten and twenty year periods. Our strong shareholder return for 2016 is indicative of the strength of the businesses and the improved strategic focus and execution that our leaders and teams have delivered over the past several years. Our Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong growth while also increasing investments to further develop our incredibly strong pipeline of innovative new medicines.  Our Medical Device business refocused and accelerated our pace of innovation and develop novel commercial models to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s healthcare system and our Consumer business continued gaining share across most of our major categories and significantly improved margins with a goal of returning to benchmark profitability.  Our strong record of total shareholder returns is the result of our approach to managing for the long-term, our relentless drive for innovation, our disciplined portfolio management and our capital allocation strategy, all of which are regularly discussed as part of our ongoing strategic planning with our Board of Directors.  We believe the sustaining investments and innovation is the most important aspect of our strategy. In 2016, we invested more than $9 billion in R&D and submitted 250 NDAs, DLAs, TMAs, 510 (K)s, and CE marks for approval and received 243 product approvals in major markets in addition to a number of new product launches in our Consumer businesses. We expect to continue this rate of investment and accelerate our submissions and approvals in the future. Now another important part of that strategy is value-creating acquisitions and collaborations. In the last year, we closed several acquisitions of significant size including Vogue International in the Consumer Beauty space, and we look forward to closing on our acquisition of Abbott Medical Optics in the Vision Care space during the first quarter. In total, we completed 13 acquisitions and license of various size, 67 innovation deals and made 21 new investments from our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation during 2016. And as we previously announced, we are currently in exclusive negotiations with Actelion for a potential transaction. While we won\u2019t be commenting any further on that today, regardless of whether an agreement is reached with Actelion we will continue to look for additional opportunities to create value for our shareholders. As our portfolio evolves through acquisitions like these, we are also constantly evaluating each of our existing businesses to determine whether they continue to fit our criteria for value creation. As a result from time-to-time, it makes sense to undertake a process to consider whether a different operating structure or a different ownership for our business might be value enhancing or whether a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio. This process also ensures that we continuing to invest in the most promising areas of our portfolio where we believe we can make a significant difference for patients and consumers and create greater value for our shareholders. In 2016, we divested eight businesses from our portfolio, the most significant being the divestiture of our Noramco business in Pharmaceuticals. As you saw in our release this morning, we are currently evaluating strategic options for our Consumer and Medical Device, Diabetes franchise including LifeScan, Animas, and Calibra.  We are assessing a wide range of options including strategic partnerships and joint ventures and have not set a definitive timeline to complete this review. I\u2019d also note that there is no guarantee that this process will result in any transaction. As we undertake this review, we remain focused on best positioning these businesses in their respective markets and meeting the changing needs of our customers and patients. Given our broad base in human healthcare, Johnson & Johnson remains fully committed to the prevention and detection of diabetes and will continue to serve those impacted by diabetes through innovative products, services and solutions from our Medical Device, Pharmaceuticals and Health and Wellness businesses.  This includes important leadership and innovation in areas such as bariatric surgery and through medicines such as INVOKANA, and INVOKAMET. We will continue investing in this important area across all of our business segments. All of this is consistent with our capital allocation priorities which we discussed before.  After funding our internal growth initiatives, our estimated free cash flow for 2016 was $15.5 billion. Our first priority for that cash is delivering a competitive dividend to our shareholders and in 2016, we paid $8.6 billion in dividends which have increased for 54 consecutive years. After meeting our dividend goals, we target value-creating acquisitions with $5 billion invested in M&A and major licensing deals this year. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs. As you know, we completed the majority of our $10 billion share repurchase program in 2016. Historically, approximately 70% of our free cash flow deployed over the last ten years has been returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases. As the world\u2019s largest, the most broadly based healthcare company, we understand the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity. Our industry has a track record of producing advancements in healthcare that saves and improves people\u2019s lives and people depend on us to continue making new discoveries.  As I think back on how far we\u2019ve come, the investments we\u2019ve made in innovation and healthcare have yielded some amazing returns. The average life expectancy continues to rise and diseases such as HIV that were considered as death sentence are now treatable. Surgeries that once required extended hospital stays now can be done through an outpatient procedure. Cures in treatments reaching the market today are not only improving quality of life for many patients, extending life for others and contributing to the productivity of our society, but they are also helping to reduce caregiver burden, disability, and healthcare spending in other parts of the system such as hospitalization.  Healthcare affects each one of us in a deeply personal way, whether it\u2019s our own health or the health of the loved ones, but it also accounts for 18% of our GDP. Pharmaceutical spending is one component accounts for about 14% of the overall healthcare spending in the US. Considering that, I think it\u2019s important to be clear on how we view our responsibility to the patients and stakeholders impacted by our products. We believe that investing in innovation to create differentiated products should ultimately help people live longer, healthier and happier lives is our first responsibility. Our process to then set the prices for those products includes extensive research and collecting diverse stakeholder inputs in order to ensure that they are both assessable and representative of the outcomes and value they ultimately deliver. We have maintained a responsible approach to pharmaceutical pricing, generally limiting aggregate annual price increases to single-digit percentages below those of our competitive sets. Furthermore, in our Pharmaceutical business, we invest more in R&D than we do in sales and marketing and cumulatively since 2010, we have invested more incremental dollars in R&D than we have realized from US net price increases. Moving forward, we plan to take the next step in our prime legacy of leadership in transparency and responsible pricing. Later this quarter, we will consolidate and expand upon our disclosures with the release of our first US Pharmaceutical Transparency Report. This annual report will highlight existing disclosures of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s clinical trial data and compassionate use, as well as Janssen\u2019s transfer of value to US healthcare providers in support for patient access.  Additionally, it will include expand the disclosures on US pricing and value, as well as R&D and sales and marketing expenses. We recognize that this is one step towards demonstrating how serious we are about responsible pricing. In the long-term, we know it will take all parts of the healthcare system working together to address the challenges we are facing.  We look forward to continuing our work with government officials, our customers and other stakeholders to ensure we are doing our part to provide differentiated, value-based and affordable healthcare to people around the world. We also recognize we are uniquely positioned to provide leadership on the health and wellness issues that we understand better than anyone else. We know many of you may be curious or anxious about the impact of various changes both here in the US and globally that could impact our business. As you may know, yesterday I had the honor of meeting with the President and the new administrations and we had a productive conversation about accelerating growth in jobs in the United States. We look forward to continuing that dialogue and while it\u2019s still too early to speculate about the impact of changes to existing US health policy or potential changes to the US tax codes, I\u2019d like to provide our perspective about the changes we will advocate for and hope to see in the near future.  First, in regards to healthcare reform, we are glad that healthcare has been and continues to be a significant part of the dialogue in Washington, as well as around the world. We look forward to continuing to work with lawmakers and politicians on both sides of the aisle to find solutions that improves the health of our society. And in fact, we were very pleased with the Bipartisan support and ultimate passing of the 21st Century Cures Act in late 2016. This legislation was a significant investment in innovation signaling its importance to all stakeholders. We hope lawmakers take the same cooperative spirit putting patients first as we move through debate about the future of our healthcare system. Now why we won\u2019t speculated about what may be included in potential new healthcare legislation in the US, I would like to offer a summary of the components that we are encouraging lawmakers to consider in any new or reformed healthcare law. First, we are advocating for important elements like increased access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and coverage of young people on their parents\u2019 health plan to continue in the future. Second, we believe that any ACA replacement must support a competitive market for individual health insurance. We will continue to advocate for models that encourage innovation and value, continuing the move towards value-based care and payment for improved patient outcomes. Finally, we support reforms and emphasize wellness and intercepting disease before it happens, preventive care, more latitude for employer wellness programs and incentives for healthy behaviors are great ways to embody this focus. Outside the US, healthcare systems are evolving as well and we will continue to be a champion for improving patient outcomes and investing in healthy societies. We know that when governments invest in healthcare, they see a return on that investment in the form of worker productivity, economic growth and stability. In addition to advocating for all these healthcare priorities as a US-based multinational company, we also are advocating for the modernization of the US tax codes. As both sides in the aisle in the Washington have noted, the US tax code for business is outdated and in many cases makes the US a more costly place to do business leaving US workers and the US economy at a disadvantage.  We are very encouraged by the proposals currently in discussion and we will support business tax policy that is competitive with most developed countries and encourages innovation and growth. This includes a system based on territorial taxation in line with most economically developed nations. We also believe that there should be incentives for innovations such as research and development and the cash currently held abroad should be allowed to be brought back into the US at a more competitive tax rate. Regardless of the outcome of these discussions, we will continue to engage with global leaders and continue to be a leading voice advocating for the stakeholders in our Credo. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, so too does our business. But despite these changing dynamics at an enterprise level, we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. As we have said many times, our objective is to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market and grow our earnings faster than sales. That, coupled with value-creating M&A and our strong dividend yields is the basis for our strong long-term total shareholder return. In the near term, we are focused on meeting our financial and quality commitments. In terms of financial performance, we expect each of our three business segments to grow and contribute to our sales and income growth in 2017. And in keeping with our Credo commitment that everything we do must be of high quality. In 2016 we continued to elevate our quality standards with measurable progress. In our Pharmaceutical business, our priority is to drive continued growth while delivering on our near-term pipeline. We will do this by focusing on our five therapeutic areas of high unmet medical needs, our robust innovation engine and strong commercial capabilities.  For 2017, we expect our key catalyst for growth will include, continued strong performance of our in line products, increasing penetration in markets such as anti-coagulants, psoriasis and long-acting anti-psychotics. Capitalizing on the early launch success from key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA for Crohn\u2019s diseases, an anticipated regulatory approval for two new immunology products, guselkumab and sirukumab, each with greater than $1 billion of sales potential.  Further, we will continue to vigorously defend our patents on REMICADE while remaining competitive against at-risk biosimilar entries given our long track record of efficacy and safety. For those of you following our remarks on the webcast, you can see the many key events we have highlighted in our Pharmaceutical pipeline for 2017 including the potential approval of several line extensions, planned regulatory submissions in both the US and EU, as well as the presentation of key clinical data.  We are confident our industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and will continue working toward our goal of filing ten new products by 2019 each with at least $1 billion of potential sales as well as filing an additional 40 line extensions by 2019, ten of which have more than $500 million in potential sales.  Our near-term priority in Medical Devices is to accelerate growth through innovation, portfolio management and new business models. We are driving growth in priority platforms, sustaining leadership in our core platforms, implementing novel commercial models and seeking expansion opportunities in large growing markets with significant unmet needs. Our goal is to return to above market growth by the second half of this year and we\u2019ve planned to drive that growth through, continued progress on the restructuring initiatives in our hospital medical device businesses, which I\u2019ll remind everyone is on track to achieve savings of $800 million to $1 billion with the majority realized by 2018; more than doubling the number of new product launches in 2016 with more than 12 major launches, accelerating the impact from strategic acquisitions made in 2016 including BME in the foot and ankle space, our new expandable cage from interventional spine, Coherence Medical in the atrial fibrillation space and NeuWave Medical and Energy and as I mentioned, we plan to close the acquisition of AMO this quarter. And finally, incorporating a suite of holistic insights-driven capabilities to help health systems navigate value-based care to the care advantage in orthopedic episode of care partnerships which we announced earlier this month.  And in our Consumer segment, in the near term, our priority is to enhance our leadership in priority categories and continue to improve profitability to benchmark levels by focusing on critical geographies and iconic mega brands. Our plans for Consumer growth in 2017 includes, continuing to grow faster than the market and gaining market share across our mega brands, bringing innovation to the market and launching key science-based new products, accelerating the growth from recent acquisitions in our Beauty franchise including Vogue International, Light Therapy in our NEUTROGENA business and NeoStrata in dermocosmetics.  And finally, we will continue to utilize supply chain and SG&A efficiencies to ensure operating margins are at benchmark levels. All of these compelling strategies and strong results would not be possible without our talented, diverse and dedicated employees around the world. Today, we employ approximately 127,000 global employees with approximately 40,000 jobs here in the US. Our purpose-driven, Credo-based culture puts people first and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees. We believe employers have an opportunity and responsibility as well as an incentive to ensure their employers are healthy and engaged. Our goal is to lead by example by cultivating the world\u2019s healthiest workforce from programs that encourage healthy eating, movement and resilience to ensuring the financial health of our employees through competitive compensation programs, as well as providing important benefits to support healthy families.  We believe these programs help us to achieve our goals of attracting developing and retaining the very best talents deliver the best outcomes, positioning us to deliver another 130 years of strong growth and shareholder return. In total, we are proud of the results we\u2019ve delivered over the past several years and we will continue working to achieve and exceed your expectations for us in 2017 and beyond. I am very confident that with our robust pipelines and investments in innovation, our improved efficiency and productivity, and value-driven leaders and employees united by our Credo, we will continue to deliver strong and consistent growth.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Dominic who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2017. Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Alex and good morning, everyone. We understand that there has been some audio difficulties this morning and we apologize for that and hopefully that issue is now been resolved. As you\u2019ve heard from Alex, we are very pleased with our 2016 performance. We believe we managed our business well and that we have transparently shared information to help you understand our plans and expectations.  We ended the year at the top end of our most recent operational guidance range for sales and the negative impact of currency resulted in sales slightly below consensus on a reported basis. With respected to adjusted earnings, we also finished above our operational guidance and at the high end of our reported EPS guidance despite the negative impact of currency and exceeded consensus estimates for earnings as published by FirstCall.  Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2016. On a reported sales basis, $71.9 billion represented an increase of 2.6%, which on an operational or constant currency basis grew 3.9%. As we told you this time we expected to accelerate our underlying growth from 2015 and 2016 excluding any impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales, and the impact of Venezuela, as well as the additional shipping days in 2015 which we previously discussed.  On that basis, we grew sales in 2015 at 5.5%. We have exceeded that level of growth for full year 2016 at 7.4%. Our earnings, adjusted operational EPS growth and our 2016 guidance was expected to range between 5.3% and 7.7%. As reported this morning, our EPS was $6.73 reflects reported growth of 8.5% and operational growth of 9.4% exceeding both our original guidance and the updated guidance range we gave in October, driven by significant improvement in our adjusted pretax operating margins.  Our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 adjusted pretax operating margin. For full year 2016, we exceeded our projections achieving a 330 basis improvement while continuing to invest in our business. As you may remember, when we provided guidance this time last year, 2015\u2019s earnings had been impacted by significant divestiture gains.  As we told you at the time, not all of those gains were reflected in income, most were used to reinvest in our business, which lowered our pretax operating margin for 2015. So naturally, in 2016, without that impact, our margins improved and in addition, through margin improvement programs in our supply chain, our consumer business and our enterprise standards and productivity initiatives, we were able to further exceed our guidance. These factors have resulted in very strong adjusted pretax operating margins for the enterprise.  Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a reported sales for the fourth quarter basis, they grew at 1.7%, that represents 2.3% on an operational basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hep C sales, and the impact of Venezuela as well as the impact in the quarter associated with the extra shipping days, our 2014 fourth quarter operational growth was a strong 7.6%. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 7.9% compared to fourth quarter 2015 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 versus $1.58 a year ago or up 9.7% and adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analysts\u2019 estimates as published by FirstCall.  Excluding the net impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.59 and up a strong 10.4% for the fourth quarter. In the quarter we incurred intangible amortization expense of $252 million on an after-tax basis and after-tax special charges of $295 million, which included cost of approximately $251 million related to the restructuring that we previously announced of our Medical Device business.  Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 130 basis points lower than the same period last year due to cost improvement programs, selling marketing and administrative expenses were 29.3% of sales. This is a 380 basis point improvement from last year as we saw the benefits of many of the programs designed to lower the level of certain costs, but we continued to invest to drive growth in our key brands. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 14.6% in the quarter and 150 basis points lower than the prior year, this is mostly due to the timing of milestone payments. Interest expense net of interest income was lower reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net loss of $20 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this is a line item that includes several special items in both years. Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million in 2016 compared to a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Total gain for the year was lower than our guidance as not all of our planned activities were executed in 2016, which I will discuss further in my guidance for 2017. The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2016 was 14.5%. This lower tax rate offsets the impact of currency on the quarter and the lower than other expected other income. The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2016 was 17.6%, which was slightly below our guidance due to the mix of our business within our international affiliates. It was also lower than prior year also due to mix of business and the adoption of a new accounting standard in the second quarter of 2016 related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Full year 2016 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved from 31.4% of sales in 2015 to 31.7% of sales in 2016.  Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices at 32.2% is lower than the previous year primarily due to the Cordis gain which we recorded in 2015. Pharmaceutical margins were flat but still remains significantly above their benchmarks. Consumer margins improved by 560 basis points versus 2015 approaching benchmark levels, while still making important investments for future growth as we return our iconic Consumer brand for the market. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I\u2019ll give you some guidance on items we know maybe difficult for you to forecast. I\u2019d like to first address our cash position. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $15 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt.  As Alex said earlier, regardless of the any potential transaction with Actelion, we are always looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders and due to our strong balance sheet, we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities simultaneously. Also as Alex noted, we have now completed approximately 75% of our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to complete the program during the first half of 2017. Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with our capital allocation priorities, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions, or other major uses of cash except for the completion of our share repurchase program, we suggest you consider modeling 2017 net interest expense of $500 million to $600 million. Regarding other income and expense, which is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from litigation investment for the development corp, as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs, we would be comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This is a higher level than 2016 as certain activities were not completed in 2016 as expected. As we move forward, a portion of any gains will be reinvested in the business as we have done in previous years. In regards to adjusted pre-tax operating margins, because we did not have the same level of divestitures in 2016 as in 2015 and subsequently did not have the additional investments in our business, we delivered significant improvement in 2016 while we wouldn\u2019t expect the same level of improvement in our pre-tax, adjusted pre-tax operating margins in 2017, not including any impact of acquisition divestitures, we would expect to maintain to slightly improve our adjusted pre-tax operating margins in 2017 as we continue with the key margin improvement initiatives in our business.  And now, a word on taxes. While we remain optimistic about the US corporate tax reform proposals, our guidance today does not include any assumptions about the current proposal. At this time, we would suggest that your models reflect an effective tax rate in 2017 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%.  Now, turning to guidance on sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 includes the impact of Abbott Medical Optics which we expect will close before the end of the first quarter as well as REMICADE, the impact of any REMICADE biosimilars which we consider to be at risk due to the ongoing patent litigation as we have previously discussed.  However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT TREVICTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results of operations. This is the way we managed our business and it reflects the underlying performance of our business.  We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2017 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. For full year 2017, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of 4% to 5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $74.8 billion to $75.5 billion. Our operational sales guidance for 2015 on an underlying basis excluding any acquisitions and divestitures is expected to reflect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro at $1.07, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1%, of course we will update this estimate as we progress through the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 3% to 4% or total expected level of reported sales of approximately $74.1to $74.8 billion. And now turning to earnings, a continuing factor in our earnings guidance for 2017 is the impact of the currency movements on transactions which although hedged are still expected to be negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 20 to 30 basis points in 2017 as compared to 2016. We will be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.05 to $7.20 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 5% to 7%.  Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at $1.07 our reported adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.93 to $7.08 per share and at this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. As we look at the published models that support the consensus EPS estimates currently, it appears that many of those models have not yet been updated for the negative impact of currency movements.  So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. We expect our operational sales growth to range between 4% and 5% and our underlying growth, which excludes any impact of acquisition, divestitures to be approximately 3% to 3.5%.  With regards to expected EPS growth, on an operational constant currency adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 7% consistent with our objectives to grow earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis.  Also for 2017, we expect to maintain or slightly improve on our adjusted pre-tax operating margins based on the guidance I just provided.  As we move into 2017, we are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute on our growth plans and near-term priorities that Alex laid out to you this morning we are well positioned with the strong balance to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success. Finally, before I turn it over to Joe for Q&A, just a reminder to say the date for our pharmaceutical business review on Wednesday, May 17. Thank you, and Joe, now to you for the Q&A. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Dominic. Michele, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Alex Gorsky : Good morning Matt.  Q - Matthew Miksic  Thanks a lot for taking our question. To Alex, I had one for you. You made some comments on tax policy. It\u2019s a bit important issue I think for investors. Everyone is kind of wondering how this new administration is going to go and given that you\u2019d met with them recently a couple of just quick points if you can shed any light for us. One, repatriation seems like something that has broad appeal on maybe something that could happen relatively quickly, but when we think about the investments that a lot of companies have made in tax optimization strategies, these include obviously things like overseas manufacturing assets et cetera, how would you want to see reforms put in place or based into place, what if anything can you read into where the new administration and Congress was headed in potentially putting that process in place or should we worry as I think some investors might \u2013 that this could be sort of a change that would click into place in 2017 or in 2018? Alex Gorsky : Hey Matt. Thank you very much for your question. And just a quick comment first, I wanted to say how really pleased I am with the performance overall the company not only in Q4 but also for the full year 2016 and frankly how excited we are and confident in our prospects for 2017. I mean, if you look across the different businesses, pharma, medical device, consumer, the announced strategies that we\u2019ve actually had in place now for the past several years, I think our performance has been quite consistent with that. We are ending the year on a strong share note across all of our major franchises and we\u2019ve been able to do that while also investing for the future. You consider more than $9 billion invested in R&D. If you take a look at the other various strategic investments that we\u2019ve made in acquisitions this past year, in our consumer, our medical device, continue licensing options and our pharmaceutical business and then you compound that with some of the efficiencies and the continued path that we are on to making sure that where as effective and as efficient as we can be in our business it really delivered those results and again we think the prospects for 2017 are promising.  As it relates to tax policy, look, I would say that the major themes that we\u2019ve been able to ascertain from our ongoing discussions with the new administration but as well as other stakeholders is they are clearly focused on growing the economy and growing high quality jobs, particularly here in the United States and we believe that any of the potential changes we stated openly that there are many aspects of the blueprint that we think would be very favorable. I think net-net anytime we can get more flexibility by moving two things like a territorial system outside the United States, to be able to invest back here in the United States and other areas, we think that\u2019s a net positive. Clearly, we are being very clear with the need to have an adequate transition. To your point, given some of the investments that have been made in previous tax constructs as well as manufacturing footprint, but so far, I remain very confident in discussions that we\u2019ve had that ultimately we will make changes to the overall tax system that will be a stimulus for growth and that ultimately will help Johnson & Johnson and many other companies grow at an even faster rate going forward. Matthew Miksic : That\u2019s great and congrats as you pointed on the solid performance, particularly adjusting for shipping days. Thinking about the portfolio, if I could ask a follow-up just on, if you could update us on your thoughts on the [Audio Gap] potentially? Alex Gorsky : Sure Matt. Thanks for the follow-up. Look, I think overall, our strategy and our outlook around putting capital or working M&As has actually stayed pretty consistent through the past several years and that is, one, we want to make sure that something is strategically right that fits with our capabilities, two, that financially it\u2019s a sound investment. I think we demonstrated a lot of discipline and a lot of thoughtfulness about the way that we put the capital to work over the past few years. Next we need to just make sure operationally, that it can be done and that our ability to execute on those deals ultimately produces the kind of outcome for customers, produces the kind of value that we think is important. Generally, I think we\u2019ve been consistent with this over the past few years about 50% of our growth comes from external innovation. We think that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a very good cadence. And we\u2019ve been able to do that by the way without compromising our internal innovation. I mean, if you take a look at our freshness index of about 25%, of our sales coming from products that have been launched over the past five years, our continued increase in innovation across our portfolio and another comment that I\u2019d like to make is, also on what areas where we don\u2019t believe we should participate where we don\u2019t feel that ultimately we are helping patients or consumers do a greater degree or that we feel that there is a very strong technology path forward. Many of these are very strong businesses, but perhaps they are better in someone else\u2019s portfolio than ours, I think we\u2019ve shown a good discipline about that over the past few years. As I look across our broader portfolio, we would like to find the next IMBRUVICA, the next DARZALEX. I think we\u2019ve shown a great ability, particularly with our very strong scientific underpinning of being able to identify new opportunities, new mechanisms. We applied a clinical regulatory development expertise and then of course, our sales, marketing reimbursement teams have done a great job of making those new molecules frankly blockbusters. And you think about the fact now that in our pharma portfolio alone, we\u2019ve got 11 brands that are over $1 billion, ten growing at a very strong rate. And you compound that with what we\u2019ve done around line extensions we would like that. We have also said however that there are other areas of significant unmet medical needs where we do feel that either our clinical, our regulatory expertise, our global footprint, our sales and marketing reimbursement capabilities could increase the growth rate. We would also consider those. And I think that\u2019s been our guiding strategy for pharma.  In Medical Devices, look, over the past several years, we\u2019ve divested some businesses, but we\u2019ve also particularly this past year I am proud of the investments that we\u2019ve made in areas like extremities. We made investments in spine and we\u2019ve also made some \u2013 obviously what we did in vision care and in cardiovascular. We are excited about that and we\u2019ll continue, I think, that progression to look at portfolio opportunities and devices. And with our Consumer business, I am very proud of the progress that team has made over the last three years, for their - look, mission number one was to make sure that over-the-counter business or quality issues were remediated. We\u2019ve done that, I think the team has done really a remarkable job of meeting all the FDA requirements and by the way, we did that while reinvesting right here in Pennsylvania in the United States, in a plant in Fort Washington that we now feel is world-class and really will set the standard around OTC production going forward. Now, that we\u2019ve made that progress, we of course made the investment in areas like Vogue, and other portions of that portfolio that we think will be generating growth in 2017 and 2018 and beyond.  So, I think at a macro level, that\u2019s the way we look at it. If I take down each one of the franchises that\u2019s my description as well, Matt. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Weinstein : Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Alex Gorsky : Yes, Mike. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Mike. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Mike, just speak up a little bit if you could please. Michael Weinstein : Okay, perfect. Well, first off guys, since the audio was off for probably ten minutes, you may want to send around the transcript, just to cover some of the sections that never made it across to everybody. Joseph Wolk : Thank you. Alex Gorsky : We will. Michael Weinstein : Yes, let me touch on a couple of items and maybe if I can do this first, Dominic, could you just comment on a couple of pieces of the guidance? The organic top-line outlook for 2017 looks pretty close to where we\u2019re at, but probably a little bit below the Street. Can you just talk about any puts and takes do you want the Street to be thinking about particularly in the pharma business relative to competition, be it REMICADE or the generic competition for Concerta? And then, second down the P&L, Dominic, can you just comment on the other income guidance which is a lot higher than, I think, people were expecting. It looks like you are assuming some sales there. So is there anything there that we should be aware of and then on the tax rate line, your tax rate is a good deal higher than it was in 2016. So if you could comment on that as well? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure, sure, Mike. Well, just on the top-line, of course, we always give you constant currency guidance first. So I think it\u2019s important and when I look at the various models that are out there today that have not yet been updated, when I try to peel back the impact the currency it\u2019s pretty clear that our guidance and Street expectations if they were all adjusted for the same currency rates would be pretty much in line. So I think the Street has a pretty good sense of where we are headed in 2017. The major factors in pharma for example, obviously we included the impacts of a REMICADE biosimilar, I think many of you have also done that in your models. We will not see significant competition for other products like ZYTIGA and alike that could go generic by the end of the year, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any impact there. You mentioned Concerta, we will see an impact there. We\u2019ve already seen some impact there. And overall, I would say, I would characterize the three businesses as pharma, even without the impact of REMICADE biosimilars the growth rate is going to be slower than it was in 2016 just naturally as those products have been in the market for a while now, they\u2019ve achieved pretty good share. They still have room to grow, but the rate at which they grow, it looks like it will be a lot slower in 2017 than in 2016. Medical Devices and Consumer, we think will accelerate the growth in 2017 over 2016. With respect to other income, I mentioned that we had not completed everything that we had expected to complete in 2016, so therefore our actual other income line for 2016 was lower than our guidance, so naturally, we have some carryover into 2017. I want to emphasize though that since we are in the early stage of the evaluations of the diabetes as that line does not include any impact there, because there is no assurance that any transaction will get done in that regard. Nothing in particular that I would call out there. It\u2019s just that our normal review of the portfolio and looking at various aspects of the business, we think are either better in someone else\u2019s hands or we can get more value for our shareholders through a divestiture then of course we will reinvest as appropriately in the business and our guidance considers that as well. The tax rate is higher in 2017 that we ended in 2016. The impact of share-based compensation was greater in 2016 when we first implemented that we expect it will be in 2017, it could change throughout the year and obviously we\u2019ll continue to update you and then as we look at the mix of the business, international jurisdictions versus, domestic jurisdictions, and when you think of a situation where we have more divestiture income than a prior year, those divestitures are usually taxed at the US rate. So that adds to the effective tax rate for the year versus the prior year. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful Mike. Michael Weinstein : It is, Dominic. Let me ask one follow-up on \u2013 and maybe two parts here, so, Alex, could you just talk about the decision relative to the diabetes business, obviously, given the importance of diabetes in the category, not an easy decision to consider other alternatives for the business? And Dominic, can you talk about the profitability of that business and I am asking impart because, if you do end up acquiring Actelion or some other transaction that would be accretive to earnings, if you end up not having the diabetes business, I just want to think about the offset? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Yes, thanks, Mike. Look, it\u2019s always a difficult decision and when you look at your portfolio and as I frequently describe, it is little bit like your children, you love all of them just from time-to-time we are trying to make decisions that we think ultimately are in the best long-term interest of our customers, stakeholders and our shareholders and we think diabetes is clearly an area of a lot of unmet medical need, we are very proud of the history and track record we have in blood glucose monitoring as well as insulin pumps and some of the things we\u2019ve been able to do. We are also very proud of frankly the performance that we generated over the past few years in products like INVOKANA, the progress that we made in areas like bariatric surgery that can have a huge difference in the metabolic space. That being said, we do feel that based upon the broader market dynamics, particularly things such as pricing in certain areas has led us to the point where we say the right thing for us to do is to consider strategic options for these three particular areas of the business. I want to be clear, we still are very interested in diabetes and we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we think very important, very promising trials coming up in INVOKANA this year in fact. And it\u2019s a space where we\u2019ll continue to work with our Medical Device group, but we think at this point in time, it\u2019s important for us to look hard at these businesses and make sure ultimately that we are making the right investment for the future. Dominic Caruso : And Mike, regarding profitability, as you know, you follow the industry closely. The diabetes pricing over the last several years has been challenging and although I think our team has done a nice job of adjusting the cost structure, the level of profitability that business has declined. We don\u2019t give you specific franchise profitability, but it\u2019s been challenging to generate strong profits in the business where there is significant price decline year-after-year. Without commenting on whether or not Actelion would or would not get completed, that transaction should it get completed would be accretive to both top-line and bottom-line and more so more than offset any impact to diabetes. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Mike. Michelle, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Wolk : Good morning David. David Lewis : Good morning. A couple of quick questions and maybe some strategic ones. I guess, just, Dominic following up on a prior question here on REMICADE. I think the consensus view into this year is that REMICADE was something like a 1% hit to the top-line. Is that still a decent place to be for 2017? Dominic Caruso : We don\u2019t give guidance by product, David, as you know. But I previously commented when you think of the fact that Merck had experienced two years of a biosimilar in Europe and they\u2019ve retained 70% market share after two years. So it\u2019s reasonable to assume 10% to 15% perhaps market share erosion in the first year. Of course, in Europe, it\u2019s much more dramatic, because of the impact of the healthcare system there. So, I think if generally, consensus is in that range that you\u2019ve mentioned, that\u2019s a pretty reasonable range. David Lewis : Okay, and maybe just two more strategic questions. I guess, Alex, first of you for you, I know diabetes is going to be a topic this morning, but I guess, pruning devices shouldn't really be a surprise for investors, but I guess, I was struck by this notion of you are getting bigger in one of your big consumer Medical Device franchises which is ophthalmology, and then trying to get smaller in one of your other consumer device franchises which is diabetes. I mean, is it, should we be thinking about these two businesses the same way that you think about them as sort of two consumer assets and you want to get bigger in one and then smaller in the other? Alex Gorsky : David, thanks for your question. The way that I would frame it as, we are very excited about the opportunities we have going forward in Vision Care. We\u2019ve looked over the past several years and first of all, I want to commend the Vision Care franchise for the work that they\u2019ve done over the last two and three years in contact lenses. If you look at the growth rates, I mean, we ended up with a double-digit growth rate in Q4 by that team and they\u2019ve introduced more than five new product launches. The execution in the field with customers has been outstanding. And frankly, when you think about the broader capabilities that we have in our surgical space and the potential to marry those up with our Vision Care business and of course, when AMO became available, we just thought that was a very good match, strategically and from an operational standpoint and Vision Care, just on a incidence basis, as we look at an aging population and things of that nature, we think that there is a lot of dynamics that would suggest we are going to see strong continued growth and we think we can be frankly be very best eye care company in the world as we continue to evolve that portfolio move ahead.  Diabetes, look, as I said earlier, I am incredibly proud of the work of all of our Johnson & Johnson associates and what they\u2019ve done. We have people, scientists and people in the field that has spent their careers building that franchise. If you take a look at our actual volume share, we\u2019ve maintained a strong position. That being said, there are other dynamics within that market that make it more challenging as \u2013 particularly in comparison to other areas in our portfolio. So, I want to highlight the fact that we are still very early days in this. And we are taking a look at a range of options, but we also, as I mentioned earlier, remain very committed in the diabetes space through many of our other areas such as bariatric surgery, such as INVOKANA that continued in ongoing development programs that we have around that. So that\u2019s the way that we think about it. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, David. David Lewis : That's very helpful, Alex. Let me just\u2026 Joseph Wolk : Michelle, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Just a couple for you, Alex, you met with Donald, with our President Trump yesterday. Saw you on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Just wondering what - you commented on tax policy, healthcare policy generally, repatriation, what do you think our new President is thinking in terms of drug pricing? Obviously, he has come out with very provocative comments about removing the non-interference clause. The industry has certainly been fighting that for years. The reasons to believe that may never happen, but what do you think the end-goal is here, because drug pricing, the whole drug pricing debate has been a major overhang over the sector, biopharma stocks for the past year and-a-half. What do you think the end-game is? Is he just trying to be provocative to change behavior? Or is the industry really willing to give something up? How do you think this all plays out? That would be very helpful. And then my follow-up question is, just on capital allocation and M&A, clearly, the pharma business has been the key driver of your growth for the past, say five years, most of the earnings beats has come from the pharma business. This quarter, the pharma business came in a bit lower, as you acknowledged growth will slow in 2017 versus 2016 as a number of your key growth drivers have slowed down and face competition. We all see the news around Actelion and I think the initial reaction is okay, that's nice, but that's sort of a small bolt-on deal, it doesn't really change the company. Would you consider M&A that is more transformative to the company? Is that something that you would consider? Or would you be prepared today to rule something out like that? I mean, when I talk - what I am thinking of here is, a transaction that would have a much bigger impact on the company in terms of the sales growth, in terms of earnings growth, in terms of reshaping the portfolio, et cetera, et cetera? Thanks very much. Alex Gorsky : No, thank you very much for the questions Jami. Look first of all that \u2013 healthcare specifically was not a significant topic of discussion that we had yesterday. It really focused more on overall economic growth and as we mentioned earlier one of the things around tax, regulatory and other policies and that those are really the major drivers of the conversation. Clearly, the administration will be looking at healthcare and I think what\u2019s really important in all those conversations that I am sure will be coming, Jami, is that we look at healthcare in total. And the way that I would frame it is that, look, I believe healthcare for all the reasons that we\u2019ve talked about earlier is a growth industry going into the future and while \u2013 and we know the drivers of demand and aging population, increasing middle-class around the world, new technology that we are introducing and but, clearly that is going to put strain on the system and what we continue to emphasize is number one, the important role that pharmaceutical is playing in overall healthcare, we mentioned in the comments that pharmaceuticals make up between 10% and 14% overall of healthcare spend. If you look at a lot of studies, it would suggest that 75% of the improvements that we\u2019ve seen and things like mortality, and improvements and things like cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV, are really due to pharmaceutical. And so we want to make sure that we continue to innovate and by the way I believe a lot of the technology and innovation that we are seeing right now truly has the potential to transform many diseases and move more towards disease interception, cures than what we\u2019ve seen in the previous twenty years. And so I think it\u2019s important to keep that perspective. Two, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us as an industry to price responsibly. As you\u2019ve heard in the comments that I made earlier, we have attempted to do that. We believe that that has in fact been our practice. We announced some other additional steps that we are taking regarding transparency. We think that\u2019s important for the industry to do and we certainly do not want a few bad actors, I believe to color overall what is I think incredibly important contribution the pharmaceutical industry makes to overall healthcare. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working obviously with our other trade partners, directly ourselves to maintain that and again, I remain confident that in the long run the most important thing we can do is continue to bring innovative products to market that make a big difference for patients and consumers and that\u2019s what we are going to focused on doing.  Regarding capital allocation, as you mentioned, we are always looking at a range of options and I think that, what you see is that, our model that we\u2019ve used and I mentioned earlier the approach that we\u2019ve taken in pharma that tends to be bolt-on, takes early licensing opportunities, I would argue has been very successful and I think if you look at the number of launches, the number of billion dollar products that we\u2019ve been able to create during that timeframe, the difference that we made for a lot of patients shows that it is not a surprise as Joaquin will sometimes say, but in fact, it\u2019s rooted in a lot of strong capability. And we would expect to continue that going forward. We look at a range of opportunities and I think we\u2019ve been very clear about five therapeutic areas where we want to focus, because we do think we have strong capabilities there. It\u2019s not to the point of being dogmatic. We challenge ourselves. We do look at large opportunities. We look at very significant transformational changes to our portfolio. We have broad discussions about that with the Board. What I would highlight Jami, is that, I think the large transactions, by their very nature tend to be more challenging. They tend to be more than initiatives that are focused on growth and innovation as the majority of ours have been, they tend to focus on cost-cutting in synergies, operationally, they are just more challenging. And so for all those reasons, we found it to be much more successful to take the earlier stage, the smaller stage companies and add our capabilities that ultimately we have a good strategic and a good financial outcome for the company and for our shareholders. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jami. Michelle, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Joseph Wolk : Hi, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Dominic, one for Alex. Let me just ask a little bit more on the top-line guidance for 2017. The delta between the 2016 organic sales result of 7.4% and the organic growth guidance of 3% to 3.5% is a bit greater than we expected, Dominic, based on your previous comments, I think on the Q3 call. It feels like something may have changed since the Q3 call, is that fair? And then I had one follow-up for Alex. Dominic Caruso : Yes, I don\u2019t think anything has dramatically changed. I mean, we are not calling out any particular impact to REMICADE and I think you are all familiar with the fact that we are going to see some slower growth throughout many of the pharma brands that have done exceptionally well up to this point. I just remind you that, we had a very significant impact with hepatitis C, not too many years ago and we did call that out, because that was very significant. The impact to REMICADE biosimilars is nowhere near that level of impact. So I don\u2019t think anything has changed dramatically, Larry, just sort of pace of growth in each of the businesses as we look into 2017 it\u2019s still going to be good, but as I said pharma, just a bit slower than it was in 2016. Larry Biegelsen : All right, thank you. And Alex, if you divest the diabetes business it will represent the third major device divestiture since you became CEO. So my question is, are you done making major divestitures in the device business? And we all see what you are doing with cardio, I mean, I am sorry, with ortho, surgery, and Vision Care with the AMO acquisition building breadth and scale, but cardio, although, it's been a very strong performer, it is relatively narrowly focused. So how are you thinking about that business now? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Yes, Larry, thanks a lot. Look, you are absolutely right. The three primary drivers of our strategy and we believe where the growth going forward and in our current portfolio orthopedics group, our surgery group and our Vision Care group and I think if you look at the underlying health of each one of those franchises, we are really pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results in 2016. If we take a look at surgery for example, you see EP growing at about 14%. We see some of the other things like endomech, biosurgery, all growing at very strong rates. Hips and knees, we think came in and we are holding gaining share in many of the areas in vision care frankly had an incredibly strong quarter and we think it\u2019s well positioned for growth in spite of even new competition with launches in 2017. So, we think that those franchises are very well positioned. As we look to the future, in cardiology, we are very proud of the success that we\u2019ve had with our EP business. As I mentioned earlier, when you see EP, we probably have about 32, 33 consecutive quarters now I believe of double-digit growth. We\u2019ve had a constant cadence of new innovation. We have done some small tuck-in acquisitions for the year to augment that franchise. But we realize longer term and we\u2019ve been very open with it that we\u2019ll continue to look at the cardiovascular space because we do think there is a lot of unmet need, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll have to continue to evaluate strategically, financially to see exactly what is the best path forward. And, so I think \u2013 the only other caveat \u2013 or it\u2019s not caveat, the statement I would make, Larry, here is, I want to highlight it is early days. Regarding our decision in diabetes, we will look at a range of options. Again, I want to openly state the hard work that team has been doing in a very difficult and challenging marketplace and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we go through that decision process. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Larry. Michelle, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Glenn Novarro : Good morning everyone. For Alex or Dominic, can you comment on device utilization in the fourth quarter? We've already seen several companies positively pre-announce to the upside a few weeks ago, particularly in ortho and spine and Dominic, I remember on the third quarter call in October you gave color on monthly trends saying, September was stronger than July and August. So, I wonder if you could provide similar color on the fourth quarter trend?  And then as a follow-up, I am just wondering if we're starting to see greater seasonality in 3Q on the downside and I'm wondering if we're starting to see greater seasonality to the upside in the fourth quarter as kind of individuals work through their deductibles and plan more surgeries in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Yes, Glenn, we don\u2019t have all the data for the fourth quarter in yet, but the projections that we looked that are published do show a improvement in fourth quarter utilization over third quarter utilization and as I said during the third quarter call, we did see a slowdown. It looks like it was in the summer months, and as September rolled around, it picked back up again. We don\u2019t have specific details by month in the fourth quarter that\u2019s reliable yet to comment on. But overall, fourth quarter utilization does look better than we saw in the third quarter. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dramatically improved. I mean, we are still in very low single-digit year-over-year uptick in utilization. With respect to seasonality, we do see a phenomenon and that now, as you know, more surgeons are actually employees of hospital systems in the US that during what would be considered normal holiday period such as summer months or holidays, typical holidays that we do see less procedure volume, because it appears that there is more sort of vacation time et cetera taken by the profession that was previously the case when they were independent in running their own business so to speak as opposed to being employees of a larger institution. So we are seeing that kind of seasonality and you are right, sometimes you see an uptick when people try to fulfill or postpone I should say procedures to later in the year, so they can get their procedures in and have already achieved their deductible and other matters and then pay for the expensive or not to have to pay for the expensive surgery upfront. So we are seeing that dynamic as well. So I think this is going to change over time and it\u2019s beginning to change now as we see the dynamics in the market. Alex Gorsky : Yes, Glenn, Alex here. I would really recommend that as we look at the overall device market, and given some of the changes that Dominic brought up, be it especially in the United States where physicians are employed, holiday, seasonality, things of that, but it\u2019s changing, it\u2019s very important in the device space to take a longer term perspective and I realized in the past that see some quarter-to-quarter variations, I think we will going forward, but if I step back overall and look at what \u2013 as the markets continue to develop on an annualized basis, I think we remain very confident in some of the underlying trends. But I think it is important to take kind of longer term view. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Glenn. Next question Michelle. Operator : Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just Alex, if I could ask on a high level, following up on some of the earlier questions, pharma has been a driver of outperformance over the last year plus and the Device business has been a relative underperformer although clearly seems to be stabilizing to improving here. But just thinking about the sort of mix of the businesses going forward, considering the competition you have coming for pharma, you expect pharma to slow, you expect devices to return to above market growth going forward, does this lend more \u2013 does this make devices more important relative to pharma going forward or how do we think about how you are sort of allocating capital between the businesses and even from a capital allocation perspective, which was asked earlier? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Danielle. Look, we still think there is great opportunities in each one of these sectors and let me just with the pharmaceutical. In 2017, Dominic took you through some of the rationale regarding our guidance but, make no doubt about it, we still remain very bullish on the core fundamentals of our business. If you look at products like STELARA and SIMPONI growing in excess of 20% this past quarter, we got the additional Crohn\u2019s indication with STELARA that we think in and of itself could be a very significant opportunity going forward. If you think about the potential products that we have, guselkumab, sirukumab in the near-term and you compound that with new information that we are certainly hoping for with INVOKANA and you top that off with the future pipeline about ten compounds between now and 2019 and 2020 that we\u2019ll be launching, we are quite excited about that portfolio. And so, while we\u2019ll always be looking for opportunities to add on to it, if we look at that core performance, again we think it\u2019s been quite strong. What we see in the Medical Device is a continued acceleration. I mentioned some of the growth rates earlier around EP, endomech, biosurgery, let alone in some of our core ortho and Vision Care areas, if you compound that with some of the investments that we made, things like AMO, but things like in extremities, in cardiology as well as in spine, we think that\u2019s also going to help us accelerate growth even as we head into 2017. And we think the underlying fundamentals of that business have continued to improve over the past year and Consumer is certainly the same case. We ended the quarter in areas such as Beauty, OTC, wound care, quite strong and when you add that on to the several billion dollars worth of investments that we made with Vogue, but also in other areas we think that franchise is positioned for increased growth prospects as we head into 2016 and beyond. And then on top of that, look, we are going to continue to look for the kind of deals that I have outlined earlier that we think makes strategic and financial sense and that ultimately we can execute on. Joseph Wolk : Thanks Danielle. Michelle we have time for one more question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Joseph Wolk : Good morning, Josh. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Josh. Josh Jennings : Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to start we might be able to get a little history lesson, Alex, and Dominic, about what ACA implementation meant to Johnson & Johnson and the Pharma and Device businesses? I know it's hard to predict what's happening - what's going to happen moving forward. But what potentially \u2013 how the impact could be for the repeal of the ACA? Dominic Caruso : Yes, Josh, we had commented on this before. We did not see any significant impact uptick in business as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Certainly there was not much of an impact at all in the Pharma business on our Device business because of the nature of the type of device products we have, we did not see much of an impact. So therefore, any change going in the opposite direction, we don\u2019t think will be negative. We did see an impact in terms of the cost associated with the Affordable Care Act, but as we said before, we\u2019ve incurred approximately $1.4 billion between the pharmaceutical fee, increased rebates et cetera even excluding the currently postponed medical device tax. So we\u2019ll have to see when new legislation is announced, whether or not these fees and cost associated with the Affordable Care Act remain or if they are authored at any way. But those have already been incorporated in our business. We\u2019ve adjusted our cost structure accordingly and we have that fully baked in to our 2017 guidance as continuing as they currently are. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Josh. Before I turn the call over to Alex for some closing remarks, again I want to apologize for any audio outage you may have encountered today. We will post the comments from Alex and I from early in the call in the Investor Relations section of our website following the close of this discussion. To ensure that everyone has access to any content that may have been missed. Alex? Alex Gorsky : So, thank you all for joining the call this morning. We really do appreciate your participation and questions. And in closing I\u2019d just say that and reiterate our confidence and the strength of our businesses and our optimism for 2017. We look forward to updating you on our progress with delivering on our robust pipeline and commercial success in Pharmaceuticals, accelerating our growth in Medical Devices and capturing share gains and efficiencies in Consumer as we move through the year.  Hope you have a great day everybody. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello. This is Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the first quarter of 2017. Accompanying me on the webcast is Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  Thank you for joining us today. Our results for the first quarter were consistent with our expectations and aligned to the guidance we provided in January. As you have likely seen in this morning\u2019s press release, we are updating our 2017 guidance to include Actelion assuming closing of the transaction in June. The public tender offer for Actelion is nearing completion and has been declared successful based on the number of shares tendered, subject to satisfaction of remaining closing conditions. We sought regulatory approval in seven jurisdictions and have satisfied requirements in six of them with antitrust approval by the European Commission pending. Dominic will provide further insights on the transaction as well as the impact on all elements of guidance in his remarks following my commentary on results for the company and the three business segments. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules.  Please note that this morning's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  After prepared remarks from Dominic, the remaining time of today\u2019s webcast will be made available to answer your questions. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 60 minutes.  Now on to the results for the first quarter of 2017. Worldwide sales were $17.8 billion for the first quarter of 2017, up 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales were up 2% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4%.  In the U.S., sales were up 0.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.6% as the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported- OUS results by 0.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 1.2% worldwide, declining 0.7% in the U.S. and increasing 3.4% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus $1.59 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.83, representing increases of 3.8% and 5.8% respectively, compared to the same period in 2016. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7.5%. Dominic will provide further detail regarding earnings in his remarks.  I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance beginning with consumer, highlighting items that build upon the slides that are currently being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2016 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide consumer segment sales totaled $3.2 billion, growing operationally 0.8%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, total adjusted operational sales growth declined 2.3% worldwide. As an overarching theme across most consumer franchises, the first quarter results were negatively impacted by global category slowdown, as commented to a numerous reports published in recent weeks by consumer staples analysts and peer commentary highlighting higher gas prices, retailers reducing inventory levels and delayed tax refunds among many factors for slower growth. That slowdown is reflected in results for five out of the six categories we compete in.  Additionally, after several quarters of higher consumption for many of our products, we did see that moderate primarily in baby care and wound/other. Finally, we did see macroeconomic conditions such as high unemployment, high inflation, and low consumer confidence impacting our performance in the Latin America region. Switching to specific platforms. The beauty franchise includes the acquisitions of Vogue, NeoStrata and La Lumiere Light Mask which in total contributed approximately 13 points of growth for the franchise. Vogue sales globally totaled $98 million for the quarter. While worldwide and U.S. market shares remained relatively flat compared to the same period of 2016, the U.S. beauty market is estimated to have contracted by a little more than 1%. Aveeno Adult and NEUTROGENA were each down approximately 1 point.  The OTC franchise grew 1.5% but when accounting for divestitures, the adjusted growth was approximately 2.4%. Both adult and children's TYLENOL outpaced the respective categories and adult TYLENOL has ascended to be the number two branded product. Growth for the franchise was negatively impacted by approximately 4 points due to unfavorable comparisons for ZYRTEC and RHINOCORT brands in the U.S. where promotional inventory builds were experienced in the first quarter of 2016.  Concluding the consumer segment, oral care was impacted by the market contracting versus the first quarter of 2016 by approximately 3%. Worldwide market share is flat. However U.S. market share is down by about a half point compared to Q1 2016. Regarding our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.2 billion grew 1.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational adjusted sales growth was 2.2% worldwide. As we commented to in the first quarter of 2016, favorable prior period price adjustments or gross to net contributed approximately $200 million to the first quarter 2016 results in the U.S. This is a comparative headwind for the first quarter 2017 growth rate of 2.5 points which when added would take the worldwide pharmaceutical growth rate to 4.7%. On a product basis, the negative impact on U.S. growth rates is approximately 13 points for STELARA and 4 points each for XARELTO and REMICADE.  In oncology, DARZALEX continued its strong performance with worldwide sales of $255 million as it\u2019s experiencing strong adoption following mid-year 2016 launches outside the U.S. DARZALEX maintains its leadership in line 4 plus multiple myeloma and we are seeing accelerated adoption in the U.S. for the multiple myeloma one prior line setting pursuant to the approvals of dose indications late last year.  IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained approximately 8 points of market share across all lines of therapy based on the fourth quarter data and the CLL market is estimated to have grown approximately 20%. Outside the U.S. we continue to experience strong uptake in the G5 countries. Negative ZYTIGA growth in the U.S. was the result of higher utilization of independent patient assistance foundations, a dynamic that has carried over from the fourth quarter of 2016. In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 5%. STELARA in the U.S. gained 0.6 points of market share in psoriasis versus the first quarter of 2016. We are very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease following the launch late last year of this new indication as more than 6000 patients are utilizing STELARA for Crohn's treatment. REMICADE in the U.S. when accounting for the 2016 prior period price adjustments referenced earlier was modestly higher with volume growth, partly offset by increased discounting. The REMICADE export business continues to see the impact of biosimilar competition in Europe.  INVOKANA, INVOKAMET sales in the U.S. were negative due to lower price. In addition to increasing discounts for managed care contracting, there was also an impact from channel mix with a higher composition of sales now occurring in the Medicaid channel. For XARELTO, total prescription market share is up more than 2 points versus a year ago, as warfarin share is down to 51% versus 58% in the first quarter of 2016. We are seeing some higher discounting in managed care and government channels for preferred access physicians.  We equalize annual costs associated with the Medicare coverage gap, also known as the donut hole, over each quarter throughout the year. The timing of when these costs were assigned to each brand in 2016 had an impact for year-on-year comparisons. Taking this into account, coupled with the impact from last year's favorable prior period price adjustment previously referenced, growth for XARELTO for the quarter was approximately a positive 2%.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectable portfolio achieved strong results in all major regions due to increasing market share. CONCERTA in the U.S. is experiencing negative price due to the re-entry of generic competition. Other neuroscience was impacted by the 2016 divestiture of the Noramco API business which accounted for $60 million of lower sales. I\u2019ll now turn our attention to the medical device segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.3 billion, growing 3.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.7% worldwide.  Vision Care results now include the Medical Optics business which we acquired from Abbott in a transaction that closed on February 27. The one month of sales totaled $124 million for that business. The contact lens business grew approximately 5%, continuing its trend of market share gains through new product introduction, namely OASYS 1-Day products globally and variants of the DEFINE lens outside the US.  Hospital medical device growth of 2% was driven by our priority platforms which as a reminder we consider to be electrophysiology, endocutters, energy, knees and trauma. Combined, that set of businesses grew operationally 6.5%. Electrophysiology grew approximately 17% worldwide as atrial fibrillation procedures continued to grow, estimated at 11% for the quarter in the U.S. and 14% outside the U.S. Strong adoption of newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters continued. This business has grown double digit percentages in 29 out of the last 30 quarters.  Within the advanced surgery category, endocutters grew 10% primarily driven by GST and PBS growth globally. Energy growth of 6.9% was driven by the inclusion of the Megadyne acquisition and strong OUS performance from new products in China and Europe.  The specialty surgery business was down compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven by U.S. declines in the aesthetics and advanced sterilization businesses. Within orthopaedics, knee growth was driven by continued uptake of ATTUNE outside the US, particularly in China and the Middle East Africa region. Trauma, including sales from the acquisition of Biomedical Enterprises was flat versus a year ago. Growth in hips was generated by continued uptake of the CORAIL primary stem system in the U.S. and the launch of the GRIPTION platform in China. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in orthopaedics but was partially offset by favorable mix. For the quarter in the U.S. net price in hips was negative 2.1%, knees negative 1.7%, positive 0.2% in trauma and positive 2.8% in spine. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's 2017 first quarter. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the first quarter. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic Caruso : Thanks Joe and good morning everyone. As Joe has outlined for you, our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter as part of the full year guidance that we provided in January. Though we had some challenging dynamics and difficult comparisons regarding sales this quarter, we remain on track to achieving our full year sales and earnings guidance.  Since Joe walked you through the sales results for its business, I would like to add some overall commentary on those results, discuss our operating performance and what we expect for the balance of the year. We continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers as our CEO Alex Gorsky described for you on our last conference call. In our pharmaceutical business we saw a very little impact in the first quarter from biosimilar competition to REMICADE in the U.S.  Joe mentioned some of the comparative challenges we encountered this quarter but adjusting for those factors and the impact of divestitures, we grew at 4.7% operationally which we believe is at or even slightly above projected market growth rates. Our newer products in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience continue to deliver solid growth, and we have one of the best pipelines in the industry. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of that pipeline at our upcoming pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 17. In our consumer business, we saw category deceleration in Q1 across many of the markets we compete in, along with continued macro-economic factors in Latin America and Asia which impacted growth. Many industry reports suggest that the consumer category will rebound in the near term and we believe we will be well positioned to grow above market through geographic expansion of current products, the acceleration of our recent acquisitions, and the introduction of new products which are expected to generate approximate 2 points of incremental growth going forward in 2017.  And in medical devices, our Vision Care business had solid growth from recently launched products and our newly acquired Surgical Vision business is growing at over twice the rate it grew in the first quarter of 2016. In our hospital medical device group, we saw our priority growth platforms that now represent approximately 40% of our sales deliver solid growth of approximately 6.5% operationally, while some of the core categories did experience slower growth.  As you know we have been managing our portfolio through divestitures and strategic acquisitions, including several new products and technologies in faster areas of growth such as our recently announced acquisition of Neuravi, a novel technology for ischemic stroke and we expect new products to accelerate our growth for the balance of the year by 1.5 to 2 points. Our guidance from January also included the expectation that our adjusted pretax operating margins should be stable to slightly higher in 2017. We were pleased to see that our disciplined expense management delivered on this expectation in the first quarter with a 50 basis point improvement in our adjusted pretax operating margin to 33.4%. And while we expect investment levels to increase throughout the year, we continue to expect that we will maintain to slightly improved adjusted pretax operating margin for the full year.  Finally, as Joe pointed out earlier we have had many positive developments concerning the steps needed to close the Actelion transaction and we expect to complete our acquisition of Actelion by the end of the second quarter. As a result, in a few minutes I will provide 2017 guidance for you to update your models that includes the expected impact of Actelion on our full year 2017 results. But first, I'd like to highlight some key points regarding our first quarter operating results. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2017. As we\u2019ve mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 2% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, it was 1.2%. If you direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items.  As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2017 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $616 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following : intangible asset amortization expense of $244 million, a charge for the continuing restructuring of our hospital medical device business of $121 million, and the AMO acquisition related cost of approximately $251 million. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.83, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 5.8% versus the prior year and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.86 or up 7.5% over the prior year.  Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 20 basis points, primarily due to manufacturing cost improvements which were partially offset by transactional currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.6% of sales, or 20 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.6% and in line with the prior year as we continued to advance our promising product pipelines. Interest expense, net of interest income, was higher than last year due to higher debt levels. Other income and expense was a net gain of $160 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $40 million in the same period last year. There are no significant items in this line in either the current or the prior year periods.  Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.5% compared to 16.3% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The first quarter rate is lower than the annual effective rate we provided in January and likely lower than many of your models as the timing of the benefits associated with stock based compensation tax accounting primarily impacts the first quarter as we described last year.  Turning to the next slide, I\u2019ll now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2016 year end call we commented on our segment results adjusted for income tax \u2013 adjusted for earnings before tax versus the prior year. Now that our competitors have reported their results for 2016, I'd like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2016 adjusted income before tax was 31.7% compared to 26.7% weighted average for our competitors. In the first quarter of 2017, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2016 driven by higher operating profit, some favorability in other income. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, medical devices at 31.6% is lower than the previous year primarily due to unfavorable transaction currency within cost of goods sold. Pharmaceutical margins improved from the prior year by 400 basis points primarily driven by lower manufacturing costs and favorable product mix. And consumer margins improved to 20.2% now estimated at benchmark levels while still making the necessary investments to deliver future growth.  Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. Today we will be providing guidance that assumes we close on our acquisition of Actelion by the end of the second quarter. Before I move to that guidance, I would like to reiterate our guidance from January which remains unchanged without the impact of Actelion. As a reminder, that guidance was as follows : we expected operational sales to increase 4% to 5% for the year; this would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $74.8 billion to $75.5 billion.  Our operational sales guidance for 2017 on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was expected to reflect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Our adjusted EPS guidance expected a range of $7.05 to $7.20 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 5% to 7%. I will now provide our complete full year of 2017 guidance now, including the expected impact of Actelion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $7 billion of net cash which consists of approximately $39 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $32 billion of debt which reflects our cash position following the close of Abbott Medical Optics and our recent debt offering. As a reminder, we plan to complete our share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter.  Also, by the end of the second quarter we expect that we will have closed on the Actelion acquisition at a purchase price of approximately $30 billion. Therefore for purposes of your models and assuming no other significant uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $600 million and $700 million. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion which is consistent with our previous guidance. And for taxes, our guidance today does not include any assumptions about potential tax reform measures. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2017, excluding special items, is approximately 19% to 20%, also consistent with our previous guidance.  Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 now includes the expected impact of Actelion and already had included the impact of Abbott Medical Optics, which closed in the first quarter, as well as the expected impact of REMICADE biosimilars which we consider to be at risk due to ongoing patent litigation. In addition, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT, PREZISTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.  We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2017 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 5.8% and 6.8% for the year. This would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $76.1 billion to $76.8 billion. This is higher than our January guidance as it now includes the expected impact of Actelion.  Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as an example as of last week at $1.07, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%. Plus under this scenario, we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 4.8% to 5.8% for total expected level of reported sales of approximately $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion. And now turning to earnings. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range between $7.12 and $7.27 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%, an increase of $0.07 over our January adjusted EPS guidance. If currency exchange rates for all of 2017 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share due solely to currency movements. Therefore we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted earnings per share ranging from $7 to $7.15 per share or a growth rate of between 4% and 6%. As it is still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. Our estimate of the immediate positive impact to adjusted earnings from the anticipated second quarter closing of the Actelion transaction assumes we will exercise an option related to one of the R&D programs in the R&D spinoff company Idorsia later this year, which will increase our R&D expense for 2017. At this early stage we remain comfortable with our estimate of a positive first full year impact to adjusted earnings per share of between $0.35 and $0.45 per share. We will of course update you further on this estimate when we provide full year 2018 guidance.  So in closing, we are raising our operational sales and EPS guidance to include the expected impact of our acquisition of Actelion and we remain optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely: we are expecting operational sales growth of between 5.8% and 6.8%; we continue to deploy good cost management and expect to maintain or slightly improve our pretax operating margins. Our operational adjusted earnings per share growth in our guidance remains strong in the range of 6% to 8% consistent with our goal of growing earnings faster than sales. And our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our near term priorities.  And we're pleased to continue seeing significant milestones in our pharmaceutical pipeline and are confident in the continued growth expectations for that business. In fact, we look forward to discussing this with you in more detail at our May 17 pharmaceutical business review day.  Now I\u2019d like to turn things back over to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Dominic. Manny, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Dominic, just a couple questions for you -- I'm just trying to get my head around the new guidance and you did a nice job explaining all the pieces, but -- so this quarter you beat by $0.10, but for the full year you're only raising guidance by $0.07 and that does include the impact of Actelion. You did mention that this is just a half year impact, so even if I assume that you wouldn\u2019t experience the full half-year impact -- even if I assume that the synergy impact is back-half weighted and assume that you only benefit from, say, a third of the synergy, I am still coming up a little short. Perhaps it is this R&D expenditure that explains the difference but that would seem to be -- that might explain only part of the difference. So if you could just walk through again the different pieces -- I'm surprised that the guidance didn't come in above given your original Actelion guidance but again I'm sure that there are timing issues in this R&D expense, that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up question on REMICADE; thinks. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Hi good morning, Jami. Well, just a few things. So regarding our first quarter results of $1.83, that's about $0.06 higher than current estimates. You could break that down between $0.03 or $0.04 related to a lower tax rate than is in the Street\u2019s models for the first quarter and the balance related to basically good cost management.  With respect to that tax rate, we did not change the tax rate for the year. So the lower tax rate in the first quarter compared to what is in many of your models really is just timing related to the stock based compensation accounting which is mostly reflected in the first quarter. So -- and through the balance of the year we do expect some increased investment which would offset some of that favorability in expenses in the first quarter. Regarding next year for Actelion, in the first full year 2018 we\u2019re still confident with our $0.35 to $0.45 per share. If we look at this half year, it\u2019s a couple things going on. First of all, you're exactly right. I mentioned the R&D -- the option we have with respect to one of the R&D programs in the spinoff company and we're assuming that we will exercise that option which will impact our R&D expense in the latter half of the year as a cost, that's worth about $0.08, we gave guidance that's about $0.07 higher related to adding Actelion, let's call that $0.15 for half a year of Actelion assuming that the option wasn't exercised, and that's just slightly lower than the half a year at $0.35 or so for next year and that's because all of the synergies related to the transaction really ramp up in 2018, not in the early stages of the integration in 2017. So hopefully that clears things off. Jami Rubin : Yes, that\u2019s definitely helped. So the $0.35 to $0.40 is really a second -- the first full year? Dominic Caruso : That's correct. Jami Rubin : That's not including \u2013 I mean the original press release said first full year which was from the time you closed, so \u2013 Dominic Caruso : So, yes, the $0.35 to $0.45 is 2018\u2019s estimate. Jami Rubin : Okay, that's helpful. Just second question on REMICADE, the impact from biosimilar is, as you said, very minimal. What are your expectations for the remainder of the year? And then lastly, I am curious your thoughts, Dominic, on prospects for corporate tax reform and repatriation, just given some of the dysfunction in Washington. Thank you very much. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well for REMICADE we saw very little impact in the first quarter. Of course, it's early because the product just launched at the end of last year. As you know there is no interchangeability, so we certainly don't expect that decisions will switch patients, they may start new patients on therapy. But with the long history that we have of REMICADE\u2019s efficacy and safety, we believe patients will move slowly to switch to a biosimilar and we've incorporated that planned utilization in our guidance for the year and hasn't changed from the time we gave guidance in January, which is well before we saw any impact in the quarter.  With respect to tax reform and what we expect to happen, I was actually just in Washington last week and one of the things that I think is very clear is that the House has a plan that they want to move forward which includes the border adjustment tax, that has not yet been adopted by the Senate, although everyone agrees that some innovation in the way jobs will be created in the U.S. is important and I would say the grand summary from my takeaway was that both the House and the Senate are waiting for guidance from the White House on whether they prefer the border adjustment tax or whether they have another vehicle that they would like to implement. And while everyone is waiting for that, things have in fact stalled as you said, but I am confident that we're talking about the right things, we're talking about a lower U.S. tax rate, we're talking about a territorial system and we're talking about some innovation and some incentive for job creation in the U.S. And that latter point is the one that's up for discussion waiting for some clarity and preference from the White House. Joseph Wolk : Manny, next question. Maybe before we take the question, I just want to make sure in the last dialogue there was a reference to $0.35 to $0.45 and $0.30 to $0.40, just want to for clarity for your models, it's $0.35 to $0.40 for the first full year of Actelion. Next question, Manny please. Operator : Next question is from Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan. Michael Weinstein : Thanks and maybe just to add to that, Joe, the $0.35 to $0.40 is a net number that assumes a certain level of reinvestment back into the company \u2013 so Actelion -- right on a gross basis? Joseph Wolk : That's correct, Mike. Dominic Caruso : That's correct Mike; that's correct. Michael Weinstein : Dominic, I think what would be helpful is, is you\u2019ve made a number of comments about both consumer and pharmaceuticals and I think that it would probably be helpful to help -- give your perspective on what you saw this quarter that you think was one time in nature and what you think that -- what you think will persist over the balance of 2017, for both of those businesses? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, with consumer I would say that what was a little bit more pronounced in our expectation was going into the year was the level at which the category growth that we compete -- the categories that we compete in decelerated. That of course then turns into inventory destocking, if you will, by the various trades. That's a phenomenon that we think is not long lived, because obviously eventually as consumption either picks up or even continues at a reasonable pace, inventory will need to be restocked at the trade, so we'll see some corrections to that.  Plus, with respect to our own business, we have a number of new product launches, very few of them hit the first quarter, they're all scheduled that now second quarter, third and fourth and those as I said earlier could impact our total growth rate by an incremental two points of growth going forward. So we don't think that the first quarter results for consumer will continue at that pace that we just saw; we think they will improve throughout the year.  With respect to pharmaceuticals, I mentioned that we were pleased to not see much of an impact in REMICADE biosimilar, there may be some additional impact as we go through the year but nothing's changed our estimates for that, it's all baked into our guidance. We did see -- we did see some pricing dynamics particularly in the cardiovascular metabolic space, so INVOKANA and XARELTO. Those are competitive markets, lots of entries in that market and therefore the payer dynamics are more competitive there. So we saw some lower pricing there; that's also baked into our estimates for the quarter, so not something dramatically different than what we expected. Michael Weinstein : Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, but a couple of items, just to follow up. So one, I wanted to get some clarity on your view of the upcoming IPR decision on ZYTIGA, this is on the 438 patent. Does the outcome of the 438 IPR have any impact on your 30-month stay? Our impression is no in that regardless, you wouldn't see generic competition prior to October 2018? Dominic Caruso : That's correct, Mike. That's our position as well, that whatever the outcome is of that hearing it will not impact the 30 month stay. Michael Weinstein : Okay, then last item. On the upcoming presentation of the CANVAS trial, there's been some discussion on the Street about the study in which you may or may not know about the results of the trial today. Is there anything you want to add relative to just the change in expectation of that study? Dominic Caruso : Well, we\u2019re going to unveil the results of that study in June at the ADA meeting, so it\u2019d be premature to comment there. Joe, do you have anything else to add? Joseph Wolk : No, that\u2019s currently the only scheduled release date at this point in time. Operator : Next question is from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking the question. Could we take a look at the big picture med-tech, what you are seeing as it relates to the usual suspects of volume, price and how we\u2019re entering the year? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well couple things, I mean in terms of our med-tech business, as you know we have a focus on certain priority platforms that are about 40% of our business, and I said earlier they're growing about 6.5%. And that does have some pricing pressure in it, so the volume seems very good there. Overall med tech or let me just call it hospital procedures and overall volumes in the U.S. hospital setting seem to be relatively flat, not much growth from quarter to quarter, so relatively stable but no inflection point in growth for sure.  And with respect to products in our core platforms, those products are generally more susceptible to more significant price impacts. Joe, anything else you want to add to that? Joseph Wolk : Joanne, one way we typically answer these questions around utilization trends, and so this day that lags a little bit but in the fourth quarter for hospital admissions it was up almost a percent; surgical procedures were down about a half percent, and lab procedures were up a percent. We see anywhere based on our very preliminary estimates for the first quarter of 2017 they were from flat to 1% up across all three of those categories. Dominic Caruso : But I would say no significant acceleration or change in the pricing dynamics that we've been seeing. So steady as she goes with respect to slightly negative price across the industry. Joanne Wuensch : That's very helpful. Can we turn off to some of your portfolio management? Specifically last quarter you talked about your diabetes franchise being evaluated on strategic basis, and then also early comments on the AMO integration. Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, with respect to diabetes, we continue that process, we're evaluating various options for that business, whether it be partnership or outright divestiture or whatever is best in terms of giving that position -- giving that business the best position to succeed and obviously getting -- if we were to divest it getting the right return for our shareholders.  With respect to the AMO acquisition, it's going really really well, I mean it just obviously was integrated in February, we welcomed the AMO colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They are very important part of now a complete health offering that we have at Johnson & Johnson, coupled with the ACUVUE brand which obviously has great recognition, the innovation that we already know about and know how to do well both in manufacturing and lens technology. I think this is going to be a fantastic acquisition for us; it's off to a great start and quite frankly before we acquired them in the quarter they were doing really well with new product launches growing at a rate that was double the rate that they were growing at last year's first quarter. So we're very pleased, it's off to a great start. Joseph Wolk : And just for clarity, as folks look at the schedules that we provide, the AMO business will be split into two categories. The consumer solutions business will be put in with the contact lens portion of the business and surgery will be carved out on its own. So for the quarter we had $124 million recognized in sales from the AMO acquisition, $115 million of that was in the surgery category. Operator : The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic, can you please confirm that the $1 billion from \u2013 or tell us if the billion dollars from the Codman neuro business divestiture if that\u2019s included in the current guidance or not and if you will include it in operational EPS in 2017? And second, Dominic, you maintain a 3% to 3.5% underlying growth, but I think you did about 1.2% in Q1. So what gets better in Q2 through Q4 and do you still expect the medical device and consumer division\u2019s growth rate to accelerate in 2017 over 2016? I think you said that on the Q4 call. Thanks and I just have one follow up. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, Larry, we have a number of plans with respect to various divestitures. We announced Codman because it was the most significant of those that we have plans with, but the basket of all of those is what we have included in our earnings guidance for the year of 1.1% to 1.3% in the other income line. So it'll be part of that other income line and not excluded from our earnings. And as you know we always take the opportunity to reinvest those gains back into the business. So we don't expect that it will have that much of a significant impact on overall earnings as our -- as I mentioned earlier our investment levels will go up, the system was recognizing those gains.  Couple things with respect to medical devices and consumer, as I mentioned earlier we do expect product launches in the remaining part of the year, adding about 1.8% growth in the medical devices and about 2% growth versus the current levels to consumer. In medical devices we also had some tough comparisons in the first quarter. We still had some inventory destocking and distributor issues in China which obviously won\u2019t repeat going forward in the year. And likewise in consumer we have as I mentioned this category deceleration which we think will improve throughout the balance of the year. We currently expect that consumer will do about the same as it did last year and if the deceleration in the category growth continues further, then we expect that it would do slightly less. Medical devices about on par now with next year but I do think that it will be at or very close to the market growth rates for the industry overall. Joseph Wolk : The headwinds in the first quarter, Larry, to be aware in the medical devices, we had approximately 0.4 less selling days, if you will, it's obviously not selling days but procedure days. So that was worth about 60 basis points. And then also in consumer you had about a 50 basis point impact due to some remaining affects from India demonetization as well as Article 94 in China. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. Guys, on your ortho, hip and knee, your recon business is doing well but the spine continues to struggle. You talked about product gaps there. What are those product gaps? How do you address them? And trauma, that was also soft; when do you expect that to bounce back? Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic Caruso : So with trauma, let me take that. With trauma, that's the business that we saw this inventory destocking issue with changes in distributors in China as I mentioned earlier. So that was an impact in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. Spine, some product gaps there that I would point to are expandable cage and we just did acquire an expandable cage, so we expect we will have a good offering in that particular segment of the market as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Matt Miksic : Thanks good morning and thanks for taking the question. One, on the recent acquisition that you announced, Neuravi and sort of backing up and looking at your med device strategic activity over the last year or so. This is, I guess, maybe the third or fourth, this is the latest in a series of these kind of smaller acquisitions, putting AMO aside. And I just wonder if some of those in AFib, some of those in surgery, this one of course I don't believe lines up with the current field force or call points that you have. But Dominic, it could be helpful maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how this fits in with your strategy, whether these kinds of things or what we should expect going forward? And if there's anything in particular about Neuravi, whether it's data or a buildout that we should know about? And then I have one follow up. Dominic Caruso : Well, Matt, thanks for the question. In our neurovascular or neurosurgery business, we obviously have sales presence. And as you recall we announced that we have an offer to divest the Codman neurosurgery business. What we're talking about with Neuravi is the piece of the Codman business where we already have sales force in place, dealing with the ischemic stroke as opposed to hemorrhagic stroke which is dealt with in the other part of the business. And this is consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio to the higher growth areas of any category. And so you're right to point out that we've been doing this quite often, we've been divesting slower growth areas or areas that we think are better off in someone else's hands and investing in higher growth areas and new technologies. This particular ischemic stroke treatment from Neuravi is already on the market in Europe and expected to be approved this year in the U.S. and it provides for faster blood flow and more accurate retrieval of the clot within the neurovascular system. So we're very excited about it.  By the way, our entire medical device business has largely been grown by these smaller tuck-in bolt-on acquisitions with technologies that advance the standard of care and with our scale in distribution we're able to do much better with that asset in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner. Matt Miksic : That's helpful and then one follow up on some of the pharma comments that you made. You talked a little bit about some pricing pressure in competitive markets. You of course have put out through recent report on transparency in pricing, and just wondering if you could comment at all on any changes we should be thinking about in terms of whether it is more competition like this and pressure related in that way or whether it's a different sort of pricing -- price increase profile for your portfolio pharma; any kind of color you can lay out for us in terms of what we should be dialing in or thinking about some of the changes in rebate and pricing in pharma? Dominic Caruso : Well, overall, Matt, we have an innovative portfolio in pharma and the innovation comes with greater patient outcome and therefore evidence that supports the pricing for the products. That's the vast majority of the portfolio in oncology, immunology, neuroscience. In certain parts of the portfolio cardiovascular and metabolic in particular, that's a little bit more crowded; it's not a specialty focused, more primary care focused. And that's where the payer community has more influence over rebates and the like. I don't think that we're going to see a dramatic change in our pricing methodologies, it's all evidence based. We look at it annually and as you know from our last report that you just mentioned, the difference between list price and net price is pretty dramatic and we think that that will continue. And so we've had modest price increases on a net price basis and we think that'll be the case going forward. Operator : The next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bob Hopkins : Thanks very much for taking the question. So two things, the first on devices and then on pharma. And then on devices, it\u2019s sort of a follow up to some of the things that have been asked in terms of the leadership changes on the divestitures and acquisitions. I was wondering, Dominic, if you can just give us a sense as to kind of where are we in the process? Should we expect kind of more strategic activity in devices? Is it a potential for larger transactions in devices given kind of the level of activity and changes at the top in devices over the course of last year, would love to get an update on kind of where we are in your process? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, couple things, Bob. The restructuring was announced more than a year ago, I guess January of 2016. So we've been in the process of restructuring the medical device business. We've been making changes in the portfolio well before any leadership changes were announced. I think that will just continue; it's not going to dramatically change as a result of any leadership changes; that's a strategic point of view that we have on various markets. But I don't think that'll change.  I don't think any one particular leadership group will have an influence one way or another over whether we do larger or smaller transactions, are all individually analysed. We're very disciplined about it, they have to be strategic, they have to return a weighted average IRR that's higher than our weighted average cost of capital. So none of that changes just because of leadership changes. I don\u2019t think that you should expect any dramatic change there. I would expect a continual improvement in the business over time all of which has been started over a year ago. It takes time to improve a business that's so widespread and diverse as our medical device business but we're making good progress. And I would just reiterate that we expect it to have nearly a billion dollars of cost improvements in that business achieved by 2018 and we're well on our way of doing that. So I don't expect any changes there as well. Bob Hopkins : So I guess just in terms of the potential for larger transactions in devices, how would you kind of comment on that? And then the other quick -- and I just want to get your view on -- and this is just a quick question on the pharma growth. The difference between the 2.2% that you mentioned in terms of the pharma growth this quarter and the 4.7% I think you said, I know it has a lot to do with pricing but maybe you could just kind of break that down as many pieces you're willing to give? Dominic Caruso : With respect to larger in devices or larger in any business it's really the same for us, it's not really focused on any one business being more focused on larger or smaller, has to do with whether or not it's an area of strategic importance for us, whether the asset is one that we think we can grow better in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner, and whether we're going to get a return for our shareholders that's commensurate with the risk that we have by putting our shareholders capital to work. So really doesn't vary in devices, consumer, or pharma in any regard with respect to whether one business would be more likely to have a larger versus smaller acquisition, depends on each individual transaction and we're really agnostic, although I will say in medical devices are history has been a great deal of bolt-on acquisitions and now and then a pretty large acquisition, the largest one we did was Synthes now five years ago or thereabouts.  With respect to your question on pharma, 2.2% versus 4.7% \u2013 the 2.2% growth is pharma ex acquisitions and divestiture impact and the 4.7 pharma growth has to do with simply adjusting for the $200 million of purchase price adjustments that were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 -- their prior period adjustments I should say were related to Medicaid rebates, managed care rebates that were late in reporting into us and therefore we've recorded all those in the first quarter of 2016, they had nothing to do with 2016, they're all from prior periods. So we excluded that in the calculation of the 4.7% to give you an apple to apples underlying growth rate for the pharma business; hopefully that's clear now. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG. Dane Leone : Thank you for taking the questions. So when you think about the Actelion merger and just the general strategy in pharma, several times on the call have come up and just different trends in pricing and have better markets are -- just curious could you just kind of reiterate the strategy in terms of going more into a cardiovascular space even though you know there's more differentiation. Just in general to the comments of cardiovascular metabolic being more competitive and having more of an effect on pricing especially in the US, how you see Actelion fitting in and kind of the diversification of portfolio? Dominic Caruso : Sure, Dane. Well, in the cardiovascular space with respect to Actelion, I mean that's not primary care, it's more specialty based. So therefore it's consistent with our overall strategy of being focused in specialty, pharmaceutical areas more so than in primary care. So I don't see the same kind of pricing dynamics in the specialty area that you do in the primary care area. Hopefully that\u2019s clear. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Dominic, I just wanted to come back to consumer and a quick follow up. Just the things you mentioned the consumer this quarter all seem largely either transitory or tied to the broader industry. But the big thing we talked about this quarter in consumer has really been accelerating e-commerce risk. And I wonder if you sort of talk about that, do you see e-commerce as an accelerating risk to the JNJ businesses or do you think that your brands are frankly more durable? And also about the 20% margins, you've got there dramatically faster than you ever expected. So strategically from here is the focus to get to 25% margins or reinvestment and I had a quick follow up. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, a couple things -- e-commerce is not a risk, it's a real obvious trend in industry where we're well positioned in getting better positioned. Our brands are iconic in nature, they do still have quite an appeal to a mass audience and you see us continuing to advertise for example with Neutrogena, and Aveeno and Tylenol. So we think those brands still hold up well in more classic marketing although we're very present in e-commerce and products like Vogue and others that we\u2019re acquiring in the consumer brand in the consumer space specialty kind of brands fit really well in the e-commerce strategy. With respect to the second part of your question, could you just repeat that again please? Yeah, well, a couple things, I mean obviously we were on a long plan to improve the margins in this business but I think as Alex often mentions first things first. So now that the business has worked through the issues that it had in the OTC. business although it's still under a consent decree, I just want to remind you we are focused on cost improvement programs and while at the same time investing. So there's no particular focus or goal to get to one particular pretax operating margin number. We expect it to be competitive with the industry which it now is but we're obviously going to take the opportunity to invest when we can especially as I mentioned we're launching new products this year. So we're going to make sure we invest behind those launches and make sure they do exceptionally well right out of the gate.  End of Q&A Joseph Wolk : Great, thank you David. And thanks for everyone for their questions and apologies to those we couldn't get to today. I will now turn it back to Dominic for some closing comments. Dominic Caruso : Thanks Joe. Well as I noted earlier we're confident in our guidance for 2017 and we're optimistic for the future. I would like to take this moment to recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their important contributions and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year and I hope to see you all at our pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 17. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen and this concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello. This is Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to the review of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the second quarter of 2017. I am pleased to be accompanied on the webcast by Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us today. As you've likely already seen in today's press release and accompanying materials, our results for the second quarter reflected strong adjusted earnings per share growth. Sales performance in the quarter highlights the strength of new products across all three segments as well as the positive contribution from recent acquisitions. Although there were some anticipated, nonoperational offsets to reported sales growth in the quarter, which we'll address during the call, we believe the business is poised to accelerate sales growth in the second half of 2017. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of Johnson & Johnson's website at investor.jnj.com. There you can find additional materials including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. Please note that this morning's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10K, which identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measure are available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. After prepared remarks from Alex and Dominic, we will open up the discussion to address questions you may have regarding the performance in the quarter with the outlook for the balance of 2017. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 90 minutes. Now on to recap the quarter's results. Worldwide sales were $18.8 billion for the second quarter of 2017 up 1.9% versus the second quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales were up 2.9% as currency had a negative impact of 1%. In the U.S., operational sales growth was 1.6% and regions outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of 4.4%. The effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported OUS sales by 2.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 0.5% worldwide. I will provide this same reference for each segment. With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.40 versus $1.43 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.83 representing increases of 3.1% and 5.2% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings grew 6.9%. Dominic will provide further detail regarding earnings in his remarks. Beginning with consumer, I'll now comment on segment sales performance for the quarter with the intent of building upon the slides being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted exclude the impact of currency translation and therefore represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide consumer segment sales grew 2.3% to $3.5 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, total adjusted operational sales declined 0.8% worldwide. Similar to the first quarter of 2017, although to a lesser extent, sales performance across some of our consumer franchises were negatively impacted by category slowdown. Additionally, there were a few distinct items that impeded worldwide consumer segment sales growth collectively by more than 1.5% worldwide. For example, in India, the implementation of a national goods and services tax, resulted in some market disruption, which negatively impacted growth by approximately one-half point. You may also recall in last year second quarter, we commented to an inventory build in preparation for an IT systems conversion. This negatively impacted sales growth comparisons by a little more than one half point in the current quarter. Switching to specific platforms, the beauty franchise includes acquisitions, which contributed approximately 12 points of growth, the most impactful being Vogue. Worldwide Vogue sales totaled $94 million for the quarter and on a pro forma basis, is estimated to have grown high single digits. The worldwide beauty market is estimated to have grown approximately 2.5 point in the quarter. NEUTROGENA grew 3.4% bolstered by strong performance of sun protection products. The OTC franchise grew 2.1%. Adult and children's TYLENOL market share continued to gain with adult TYLENOL benefiting from strong uptake of the rapid release launch. ZYRTEC grew over 17% worldwide; however, approximately two thirds of that growth was the result of inventory restocking at distributors in the U.S. attributable to later allergy season. Concluding the consumer segment, oral care sales were impacted by the market contracting versus the second quarter of 2016 by approximately 1%. Worldwide market share is slightly up from the first quarter, but flat to the second quarter of 2016. Regarding our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales grew 1% to $8.6 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational adjusted sales growth was 0.5%. As we discussed in the second quarter of 2016 and reiterated on the first quarter call earlier this year, favorable prior period price adjustments or gross to net, contributed approximately $340 million to the second quarter 2016 results in the U.S. This is a comparative headwind for the second quarter 2017 growth rate of approximately four points, which when added would take the worldwide pharmaceutical growth to approximately 5%. While these adjustments occurred across the entire U.S. pharmaceutical portfolio, the most pronounced impacts occurred in REMICADE, PROCRIT, STELARA and SIMPONI. In oncology, DARZALEX continued its strong performance as the brand continues to experience strong adoption across all lines of therapy with share leadership in line 4 plus and strong uptake in lines 2 and 3 pursuant to the approvals of dose indications late last year. OUS trend was evident in many Euro countries most notably Germany and France. IMBRUVICA continues to gain share across all indications globally and based on first quarter data, the CLL market in the US is estimated to have grown approximately 20%. Negative ZYTIGA growth in the U.S. was largely the result of higher utilization of independent patient assistance foundations, a dynamic that has carried over from the prior two quarters. In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 8%. STELARA in the U.S. gained 1.4 points of market share in the total immunology market versus the second quarter of 2016, driven by the strong adoption for the newer Crohn's disease indication. REMICADE in the U.S. after considering the 2016 prior period price adjustment mentioned earlier, declined a little more than 5%, which is below the 10% to 15% we projected earlier in the year for 2017. SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA in the U.S. when accounting for the 2016 prior period price adjustment also referenced earlier, grew approximately 4%. In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectable portfolio achieved strong results in all major regions due to increasing market share for TRINZA and SUSTENNA. CONCERTA in the U.S. experienced negative impact from the reentry of generic competition late last year. Within the cardiovascular metabolic therapeutic area, XARELTO's total prescription market share was up more than two points versus one year ago as Warfarin continues to decline in favor of branded products. Similar to last quarter, for preferred access physicians, we are experiencing higher discounting in managed care and government channels. A favorable return reserve adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 impacted comparative growth for the second quarter of 2017 by approximately three points. INVOKANA, INVOKAMET net sales in the U.S. declined due to increasing discounts for managed care contracting and higher utilization in the Medicaid channel. Finally, the pulmonary hypertension products reflect the sales in the quarter since the Actelion acquisition closed on June 16. Many of you have asked for historical data prior to Johnson & Johnson's ownership of these assets to reflect in your financial models. So, at this time we've provided an unaudited schedule of sales for this business on our website. I'll now turn to the Medical Device segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.7 billion growing 5.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.1% worldwide. The vision care business was strong on all fronts. Contact lenses grew above market at approximately 7% worldwide as new products namely OASYS 1-Day and variants of the DEFINE lens continue to be well received in the market. There is $25 million under the label of other, reflecting the inclusion of the recently acquired Consumer Eye Health Products from Abbott. That transaction closed February 27. So, this is the first full quarter we are reporting for that as well as the Vision Surgical business. To help put the surgical performance into context, on a pro forma basis, worldwide surgical grew more than 10% based on cataract lens strength. Our hospital medical devices business had approximately one half less selling day OUS as compared to the same period a year ago negatively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 80 basis points. For those in the audience who are updating their models, the impact of selling days for the balance of the year will be nominal. Within hospital medical device platforms, Electrophysiology grew approximately 15% worldwide as atrial fibrillation procedures continue to grow, estimated at 13% for the quarter. Strong adoption of newer product offerings such as SMARTTOUCH Sensing Force in ablation and advanced catheters continued. Within the Advanced Surgery category, Endocutters and Energy grew 3% and 4% respectively. Endocutter growth was driven by performance in EMEA and China, while Energy growth includes 480 basis points of growth from the Megadyne acquisition. Biosurgical's growth of 5% was the result of strength in China across all platforms and growth of the U.S. market. The decline in specialty surgery business was driven by share loss in the aesthetics and infection protection businesses. Within Orthopedics, growth in Hips was driven by continued uptake of the primary stem platform, partially offset by competitive pressures in Asia Pacific region. Knee performance was driven by growth in the U.S. market and a continued uptake of ATTUNE partially offset by declines in ASPAC related to competitor pressure and pricing. Trauma, including sales from the acquisition of Biomedical Enterprises, which positively impacted growth by 20 basis points, grew approximately 2% driven by the continued uptake of TFNA. Solid growth in the U.S. market and strength in EMEA particularly U.K., Germany and Italy. Finally, continued share loss in our spine business was principally due to portfolio gaps and was partially offset by strength in sports medicine and power tools. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in orthopedics, but was partially offset by favorable mix in knees, trauma and spine. For the quarter, price net of mix in Hips was negative 2.6%, Knees positive 0.3%, positive 2% in Trauma and negative 2.3% in Spine. That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson's 2017 second quarter. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing the many notable events that occurred during the second quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Joe and thank you all for joining our call and webcast today. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our performance for the first half of 2017 as well as update you on our outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. There have been a number of significant events in the first half of the year including completing the acquisitions of our new Surgical Vision business as well as Actelion. A few weeks ago, we also shared with you our pharmaceutical R&D strategy and pipeline of transformational medicines at our Business Review Meeting. These events all illustrate how we continue to invest for strong long-term sustainable growth and as Joe outlined for you this morning, we are very pleased with the earnings-per-share results we delivered, which exceeded your consensus estimates and our businesses have largely continued to deliver sales results in line with expectations. Dominic will take you through a bit more detail in a few minutes regarding our performance and outlook will impact our guidance moving forward, but we're optimistic that the investments we made and strategies we put in place can continue to build the momentum we need to accelerate our growth in the second half of the year. First and most importantly, I'm proud of how the commitment to our credo continues to be upheld by our more than 130,000 employees around the world. You can find many examples of how we're living into our credo in our recently released Help for Humanity Report. Holding ourself accountable to the important responsibilities highlighted in our credo, unites us and guides us in achieving our mission. As we look at the external environment and potential impacts on our business, there are a few topics that I am often asked to comment on that have been areas of interest in recent weeks. First in terms of our interactions with the US Administration, we're pleased that senior officials are continuing to listen to business leaders, when considering the impacts of legislation and we'll continue to participate in these conversations as well as those with other world leaders to make sure our voices are heard on these vital issues. In fact, I'm here in Washington DC today meeting with U.S. and global leaders driving forward discussions on the important issues impacting healthcare today. On the topic of Healthcare Reform, we continue to support initiatives that expand access to affordable healthcare and improve long-term sustainability of the U.S. healthcare system. We've been monitoring the ongoing development of the AHCA with great interest and think that as our political leaders bring the new healthcare bills through Congress, it is important that they consider how these efforts will ensure stability within the system, while enhancing the competitive market and fostering continued innovation for new treatments and cures. In terms of the potential Executive Order on pharmaceutical pricing, we understand the concern about the cost of healthcare and believe we have a responsibility to ensure our products are both assessable and representative of the outcomes and value they deliver. We recognize the important role pharmaceutical drugs play in improving healthcare outcomes. We know these medicines represent only about 15% of overall healthcare spending as they also represent a critical component of effectiveness and efficiency in the healthcare system. As we note in our 2017 Janssen US Transparency Report, we've maintained a responsible approach to pharmaceutical pricing, generally limiting our aggregate annual price increase to single-digit percentages below those of our competitive set. We'll continue working with all our stakeholders to ensure sustainable future for America's healthcare ecosystem. Finally, while we remain optimistic that there are opportunities from modernization of the corporate tax code in the near future, we'll continue to monitor any developments or progress as Congress prioritizes this among other pressing needs. As we said before, we believe fundamental elements of our current tax system are outdated and disadvantaged U.S. companies against our international competitors who have reduced tax rates, domestic-only taxation and have incentives for innovation and investments. We look forward to continuing our work with government officials, our customers and other stakeholders to ensure we're doing our part to provide differentiated, value-based and accessible healthcare to people around the world. Regardless of the outcome of these discussions, we will continue to engage with global leaders and be a leading voice advocating for the stakeholders in our credo. As we evaluate how we are and will be positioned in the markets in which we compete, we continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses. We see external innovation and acquisitions or licensing deals as equally important to our growth strategy as our internal innovation programs. While we continue to make progress on our rich pipelines across our three business segments in the first half of this year, we've also closed eight acquisitions or licensing deals including Actelion and AMO and as we announced in January, we're continuing to work on strategic options for our medical device diabetes franchise. As we evaluate each of our businesses, we always want to ensure they are good strategic fit, that they're addressing unmet patient needs, that they are contributing to our overall growth and financial strength. One of those investments that we expect to augment our future growth is our acquisition of Actelion. We're excited to expand our already strong portfolio with leading differentiated end-market medicines including OPSUMIT, UPTRAVI and TRACLEER and promising late stage products that will help patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension and other serious illnesses. We see great opportunities with this business. Starting with the treatment of the disease itself, addressing PAH earlier, producing better outcomes and expanding into new patient populations. For the existing medications, we want to explore how combination therapies can improve patient outcomes. For the business itself, we want to expand its global footprint and when you look at the clinical development, regulatory and commercial skills at our Janssen Organization, we believe there are significant opportunities to create value for both the Actelion business and Johnson & Johnson. Beyond the value we will deliver to patients and the growth we'll realize in our business, we're very excited to welcome the talented employees from Actelion. They are a great cultural fit with the Johnson & Johnson family of companies as they value innovation, patient centricity, collaboration and the very best science. We feel the Actelion business has already been and will continue to be a great addition to our pharmaceutical portfolio. Across our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver life-saving and life-changing therapies to patients around the world with an incredible pipeline of more than 10 new blockbuster products to launch or file for regulatory approval in the next five years, each with greater than $1 billion in peak year sales potential. We hope you're all able to either join us in person or on our webcast for our Pharmaceutical Business Review in May and if you weren\u2019t able to attend live, I encourage you to review the replay available on our website. Our strong and talented Janssen leadership team outlined our strategy for growth and innovation in pharmaceuticals and provide a great insight into our robust pipeline. I am not only proud of the impactful cures and treatments our Pharmaceutical business is delivering to patients around the world, but our R&D investments are projected to deliver more value than ever before and the potential value of our pipeline is greater than it has ever been. As we look at the near-term opportunities in this business, in addition to Actelion we're continuing to increase our penetration in markets such as anticoagulants, psoriasis and long-acting antipsychotics. We'll continue to build on the recent launch successes of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and line extensions such as STELARA for Crohn's disease and with the early approval of TREMFYA as we've just announced last week and the anticipated regulatory approval for sirukumab later this year, we look forward to further expanding our immunology portfolio. These two medicines represent important enhancements to our immunology portfolio, adding to our leading in-market brands like STELARA and SIMPONI as well as REMICADE. Physicians have a strong preference for REMICADE versus biosimilars and we enjoy a strong access position in the U.S. We'll continue to compete in the market and defend our IP against biosimilars to launch at risk in the U.S. Overall, we expect our immunology business will continue to grow in 2017 and we expect to maintain our leadership in this segment. In our Medical Device business, in the second quarter, we continue to have areas of above-market growth like Electrophysiology and Vision Care for both contact lens and surgical businesses based on our internal estimates. Areas where we're growing with the market like Biosurgery, Wound Closure and Hips and there are also areas where we know we still need to do better as is the case with Spine, anti and our aesthetics products. We are continuing to actively manage our portfolio, focusing on transitioning our business in higher growth areas with large unmet needs as you've seen through many of our recent acquisitions and strategic partnerships across our medical device portfolio, including our Surgical Vision Care business, Interventional Spine, Megadyne and Energy, Torax Medical and General Surgery and Neuravi in the neurovascular category. To the work we put into restructure and focus in our Hospital Medical Device business, we're on track to accelerate our number of major product launches with new products like our THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter. We're going to market with novel commercial models such as our recently announced Care Advantage Collaboration with Medical University of South Carolina to reduce infection risks and we're filling key portfolio gaps that we expect will provide growth in 2017 and beyond. As the most comprehensive medical devices company in the world, we remain confident that we are well positioned to serve a market that continues to consolidate by providing a simplified customer experience, progressive contracting and innovative solutions and developing innovations and capabilities and improve patient outcomes and deliver value to the healthcare market. In our Consumer business, we have a world-class portfolio of iconic mega brands that are professionally endorsed and we continue to believe we're playing in large structurally attractive markets despite some recent lagging category growth that Dominic will comment on later. As with Medical Devices, there are areas that are performing well like Beauty and OTC where we continue to see strong results. We know we have work to do in other areas such as our Baby Franchise whereas we previously discussed we're working to revitalize and relaunch key products. We're also leveraging our scale in global footprint with a strong portfolio of local brands in emerging markets, which will serve as an entry point for further expansion across our enterprise. Additionally, we expect to further accelerate our growth through our recent acquisitions in the beauty franchise, OGX and NeoStrata and the light therapy products now in our Neutrogena business and we expect some of these products are new to our portfolio along with some of our recently launched innovations such as Neutrogena Hydro Boost and Tylenol Rapid Release to drive growth in the second half of this year. Overall, we continue to make very good progress on all of our near-term priorities as well as continue to invest in advance our long-term growth drivers. Our shareholder return for the first six months of the year of 16.3% continues our trend of topping most major indices over the last 3, 5, 10 and 20 years and for all the reasons you just heard me share about the opportunities across each of our businesses, we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth through the end of 2017 and beyond. And now Dominic Caruso will share a little more insight on our results for this quarter and provide some additional commentary about our guidance for the remainder of the year, Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Thanks Alex and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with a few comments on second-quarter results, which will be followed by comments regarding some changes to our guidance for you to consider as you update your models. We are very pleased with our adjusted earnings per share growth of 5.2% for the second quarter, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates on FirstCall. Overall sales results and our operating performance were largely in line with your estimates. We continue to expect an acceleration in our sales and earnings growth in the second half of the year, which I will provide further insights into later in my remarks and of course we are extremely pleased to have closed the acquisition of Actelion and I'd like to add my welcome to the Actelion employees joining Johnson & Johnson. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2017. As Joe described, our operational sales growth this quarter was 2.9% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures it was 0.5%. As many you have modeled and as we've discussed previously, this quarter's results were impacted by prior period positive adjustments we recorded in the second quarter of 2016 for reserves set aside for discounts and rebates to various payers such as managed Medicaid. Adjusting for that and excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operational growth was 2.4%. If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2017 second-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following. Intangible asset amortization expense of approximately $375 million, litigation expenses of approximately $350 million, Actelion acquisition-related cost of approximately $200 million and impairment charge of approximate $125 million related to the previously disclosed process of seeking strategic alternatives for our diabetes business and a charge for the continuing restructuring of our hospital Medical Device business of approximately $100 million. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.83, adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.86 or up 6.9% over the prior year. Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 200 basis points, primarily due to the inclusion of amortization expense from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of amortization expense for our both periods, cost of goods sold was 27.9% or 60 basis points higher than the prior year mostly due to transactional currency and product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were flat as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.1% consistent with the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was a net expense of $122 million, which was slightly higher than last year. Other income and expense was a net expense of $588 million in the second quarter compared to a net expense of $557 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of $373 million compared to a net gain of $119 million in the prior-year period. Reflecting completion of certain asset sales, which were included in our annual guidance, I will provide an update on this activity during my guidance comments. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.2% compared to 19.2% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2017, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, improved 80 basis points versus the second quarter of 2016 due to favorability in other income and expense. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 30.4% is higher than the previous year, primarily due to SG&A cost efficiencies. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 40 basis points to 44.5%, driven by other income items and consumer margins improved to 20.5% primarily due to SG&A cost efficiencies as well as some other income. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. As expected, with the close of Actelion in June at the end of the second quarter we had approximately $22 billion of net debt, which consisted of approximately $13 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. Also of note we have now completed our $10 billion stock repurchase program. Therefore, for purposes of your models and assuming no other significant uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $600 million and $700 million consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. As you know, one of our business priorities is to actively manage our portfolio to maximize value creation. Our ongoing reviews suggest we currently have more opportunity to divest some nonstrategic businesses, which will result in higher other income gains. While some of this may result in higher EPS, as we've done many times before, most recently in 2015, we intend to redeploy most of those gains back into the business to enhance our long-term growth prospects. Considering this we would be comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase over our previous guidance. In regard to pretax operating margin, you may recall at the start of the year, we guided that this would remain flat to slightly improved. As we expect investment levels to further increase in the second half of the year, we now expect that we will maintain or possibly see a slight decrease in our adjusted pretax operating margin for the full year. This of course is offset by the higher divestiture gains I just mentioned. And now a word on taxes. Our guidance today does not include any assumptions about potential tax reform measures. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2017 excluding special items is 19% to 20% consistent with our previous guidance. Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales guidance for 2017 does not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT, TREVICTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2017 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect an acceleration of our operational sales growth in the second half of the year. Across the enterprise, the second half acquisitions in 2016 as well as the major acquisitions of Actelion and Medical Optics completed earlier this year, all remain on track to slightly ahead of our original projections. Despite some moving parts, our outlook for pharmaceuticals remains optimistic as to the back-half acceleration, especially when considering easier year-over-year comparisons in the third and fourth quarters. Also, we expect that the positive factors of the earlier launch of TREMFYA and a more modern erosion of the U.S. Remicade business versus original projections will help offset the higher discounting we are experiencing. In Hospital Medical Devices, our restructuring initiatives continue to progress and as we stated previously, we expect that the contribution from new products will accelerate in the back half of this year and in Vision Care, our strong growth is expected to continue. In Consumer as you heard from Alex and Joe, although slightly improved in the second quarter, the broader market continued to experience lagging category growth. We still expect new product launches in consumer to have a meaningful positive impact on second-half growth and we will increase investment to support these launches. However, these new product offerings are likely launching into weaker markets. So naturally, that positive impact will be mitigated to some extent. The impact from the weaker macroeconomic dynamics in consumer is now estimated to continue through the balance of the year longer than we had previously expected. Considering all of this, we are updating our operational sales guidance for the year. Previously we guided to a range of 5.8% to 6.8%. Our new operational sales guidance is now 5.5% to 6%. This translates to sales for 2017 of approximately $75.9 billion to $76.2 billion on a constant currency basis. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as of last week at a blended rate of $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximate 10 basis points, a much lower negative impact than our previous guidance, plus under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 5.4% to 5.9% for total expected level of reported sales of approximately $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion, which is higher than our previous guidance. Now turning to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range between $7.17 to $7.27 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8%, a midpoint increase of $0.03 over our April adjusted EPS guidance. If currency exchange rates for all of 2017 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by $0.05 due to currency movements. This is a smaller negative impact than our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.12 to $7.22 per share or our growth rate of between 6% and 7%. In closing we remain optimistic that we will see accelerated growth in the second half of 2017 and in summary, we are expecting operational sales growth of 5.5% to 6% for the year, our operational adjusted EPS growth and our guidance remains strong in the range of 7% to 8% consistent with our goal of growing earnings faster than sales and our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our near-term priorities. Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call, Joe? Joseph Wolk : Great. Thank you, Dominick. We will now move into our Q&A session. Manny, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator instructions] And with that, the first question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro : Hi. Good morning, guys. Alex Gorsky : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Novarro : Thanks for taking the question. Let me start on the pharmaceutical side, so we continue to see pricing pressure in XARELTO and INVOKANA and we understand both drugs are in competitive categories. But is there a light at the end of the tunnel to these two drugs based on less pricing pressure in the back end of the year, so that specifically on those two drugs and then more broadly Alex, maybe talk about what you're seeing in pricing in terms of pricing pressure across the franchises? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey Glenn, thank you very much for your question and I am assuming that you're talking about the pharmaceutical business, is that correct? Glenn Novarro : That is correct. Yes, thank you. Alex Gorsky : I think it's two very different stories between XARELTO and INVOKANA and while there's always a secular backdrop here, I think of pricing pressure in many of these areas in the Pharma business. In the case of INVOKANA of course we've seen a significant impact based upon the relabeling issue and even prior to that we've seen a lot obviously a competitive pressure around pricing. And just given the incidence of Type II diabetes and the pressure on systems, we feel that the competition frankly exemplify that. If you look at XARELTO however, we continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stream of really positive data. Our very strong managed care, account management capabilities. And so, we feel optimistic about the future of XARELTO and while there will undoubtedly be pricing pressure, we think that by continuing to differentiate the brand with strong clinical information, strong value information, as well as frankly there is execution in the field, that we'll be well positioned going forward. Glenn Novarro : And then Alex can you just broadly talk about pricing in general across the pharmaceutical franchise because it look like some of your differentiated drugs, such as IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX are holding up a lot better in terms of pricing than may be some of your more GP mainstream oriented drugs. Alex Gorsky : Glen in general, we would say is that in the specialty areas, particularly in areas whether it's IMBRUVICA, whether it's DARZALEX where you're literally adding months, years of life to patients and really making significant differences in terms of outcomes, we're seeing less pricing pressure, versus the categories where you have very large patient populations, very large incidents, used more in a primary care setting. And so, we definitely see that in both cases. We think that our account management and our reimbursement teams globally are doing a very good job of making sure that stakeholders particularly our payers understand not only the benefits, but frankly the difference in overall outcomes and economic value that the drugs represent, but I think overall, those have been our major observations. Joseph Wolk : Hey Glenn, I might add as well, with the more competitive dynamic in some of the primary care drugs, you do have elevated discount levels that raise the statutory rebates as well. So, things like Medicaid, the rebates are going to be a little bit greater in those areas and then under the Affordable Care Act, you had a few states opt in to expand their Medicaid. I think it was Louisiana, Indiana and Pennsylvania, So that's having a minor impact as well. That's correct. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein : Good morning, everybody. Alex Gorsky : Hi Mike. Mike Weinstein : I am making in a couple here. So, let me touch on a few. So, number one, I was hoping you could comment on STELARA. It's probably one of the top products that the street seems to have a debate on the outlook going forward. And I think the expectation is that psoriasis uses to climb as well Crohn's sees uptake in this quarter STELARA exceeded the street's expectations with some of your commentary pointing to a strong Crohn's launch. So, can you talk about the outlook for STELARA and how you size the Crohn's opportunity and how you view it going forward? The second question is hope you can give us an update on the ZYTIGA ITR decision for the core 38 patent? I think originally you were expecting that we would hear something by the end of May, we haven\u2019t. So, we would like your expectation as to when we could hear something? And then last one, hope you can give us an update on the diabetes business and where that process stands, thanks? Alex Gorsky : Hey Mike, thank you very much and you did sneak there, but let me start with the first one. Look, we remain very positive about the overall opportunity in psoriasis. It just starts with the patient population, the unmet medical need. We believe it's only about 25% to 30% of the patients in that category are actually on some of the newer agents. So that in and of itself, represents a significant opportunity. We know that there are shifts from therapy, from one therapy to another and then when you really look at the strong data that we have and by the way, we're really excited with the recent approval just last week at TREMFYA as well that that gives us a big opportunity. And as we've been talking about now for quite some time, we really are trying to look at our immunology portfolio, not just a product by product accounting so to speak and with that, we think with TREMFYA -- STELARA, certainly we saw rapid uptake in psoriasis now in Crohn's. But if we look at the data with TREMFYA physically competitively, what we have versus Humira, we think that represents a very significant opportunity going forward. While at the same time, you take a drug like STELARA in Crohn's, again high prevalence, a lot of unmet medical need, very strong data that's going to allow us to continue to grow STELARA we think at a very significant rate going forward. So, it does represent again a portfolio approach and we think that's why we're especially well-prepared to manage through the Remicade Biosimilars, but also continue to expand our overall immunology portfolio. I'll let Joe you pick up on ZYTIGA and then I'll come back for diabetes. Joseph Wolk : Okay. Mike, with ZYTIGA you're absolutely correct. We were expecting to hear from the PTO at the end of May. We had not received order and there has been no notification since that point in time and they're not obligated to do so. So, we're awaiting word just as you are. Alex Gorsky : And Mike, as we talk about Type 2 diabetes, look obviously an area where there is a lot of unmet medical need, but at the same time an area where there's a lot of competition among SGLT2 let alone other therapeutic options in that category. There's still a lot of good news about the Canvas Trial when you really look into the data. At the same time, the recent labeling change has also impacted along with just the overall competitive environment. So, this remains an area where we're very interested. We want to make sure the patients continue to have options as well as physicians, but we also recognize the competitive nature of the category. Joseph Wolk : Hey Mike, I might just add that you may be referring to the diabetes Medical Device franchises as well and there you saw we took an impairment charges just as largely related to the Animas Pump business, not the overall blood glucose sponsoring business, which is of course the larger portion of the business. And our efforts to review various strategic alternatives are still progressing, moving along just fine, but nothing to report on that front yet. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Hi. Can you hear me alright because there is a really bad echo? I hope I am not echoing. Joseph Wolk : No. We hear you fine Jami. Jami Rubin : Okay. Great. Good. Thank you. So, I just wanted to get some clarification on the guidance raise and the revenue raise and trying to better understand where that's coming from? It seems based on our math and Dominic I want you to correct me if I am wrong that the additional $500 million or so, $500 million to $600 million or so in asset sales is adding $0.15 to your EPS. But then when I look at your previous guidance, it looks like you are only raising the guidance by $0.10. So, what is happening? What is the offset to that that $0.05? And then secondly on revenues, FX will be less of a hit than what you anticipated adding $600 million in benefit, but taking the midpoint of your previous guidance that was only about $200 million. So again, what is the claiming the difference? Why are revenues going up more just given your competence in a stronger back half and a less challenging FX environment. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Sure Jami. So, let me take it in the order of EPS and other income first and then revenue. So, in the area of other income and expense, you're right, we did raise that guidance roughly $500 million. We don't expect all of that to flow to the bottom line because as we commented in my earlier remarks, we expect as we always have done in the past, whenever we have portfolio shifts to reinvest some of those gains back into the business with respect to new product launches, R&D investments and the like. So, you may recall that we also commented that our operating profit margin instead of maintaining or slightly improving, would maintain or slightly decline. So, the vast majority of the other income raise is going to be reinvested in product launches and R&D and therefore operating profit margin before other income and expense will decline. So that's the offset. You had rightly so commented on the $0.10 raise in EPS, little over 65% of that is currency related. So, we saw benefits to revenue from currency. We'll see benefits to EPS from currency and the balance's operating performance some of which from OI&E line and none from the tax line. So hopefully that explains or reconciles for you that distinction and then with revenue, yes currency will have a more favorable impact of roughly $600 million due to a less negative impact of currency, but we did tighten up our range on operational or constant currency sales a little bit, lower that midpoint just a bit and we talked about earlier what we see in the back half of the year, although acceleration will take place across all three businesses. In the consumer business, we're seeing some much weaker markets and some macroeconomic conditions particularly in China and India. So, we've adjusted our expectations although they will increase revenues in the back half, consumer is going to face some lingering market deceleration versus the prior year. So hopefully that reconciles those two points for you as well. Jami Rubin : It does. Can I just follow-up with REMICADE? Alex Gorsky : Sure. Jami Rubin : On REMICADE, you only had one competitor on the market that will be another biosimilar that enters later this year. What are you seeing in terms of market share from Inflectra and the pricing dynamic and how do you expect that to change with the second biosimilar entering the market later in the year. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Well let me tell you what we're seeing so far is that you saw Remicade was down about 14%, but the significant impact to that was this prior period adjustment issue for rebate reserve that we discussed. So, excluding that, Remicade's only down about 5%. That 5% down has some impact of price, some minor impact of share erosion and we see some conversion of Remicade in Crohn's disease to STELARA in Crohn's disease part of Mike Weinstein's earlier question of why STELARA is doing so well is a conversion over from REMICADE patients in Crohn's. So roughly 5% decline is much lower than I think us and any of you had expected for erosion of Remicade, which we all targeted to be somewhere between 10% and 15%. So, we haven\u2019t seen much impact now. We don't know when the new biosimilar from Samsung will launch. It may launch later this year and in terms of what the impact that might have, I think that all depends on the degree to which they discount that product and significance of which they discount that product. But I would say largely for this year, we have our contracting in place with all the managed care organizations. So, we feel pretty good that REMICADE erosion overall even with the entrance of a new biosimilar will be less than we previously expected. Next question. Operator : The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Thanks, and good morning. thanks for taking our question and I would say we are getting a pretty strong echo here from our end anyway. So just a follow-up if I could on the Pharma business and then I wanted an additional follow-up on device trends. But first on Pharma we would be interested in any additional color you could share on some of the key drivers and forthcoming drivers here in the back half for example you have seen very strong first half in DARZALEX. Maybe where are we and maybe in terms of some of the extended indication what kind of ramp might we expect towards this $1 billion TREMFYA opportunity and any transitional adjustment to the Actelion DH business. Those are the odds and ends for us to consider as we put together our back-half estimates and one have follow-up for devices if 1 could. Alex Gorsky : Sure Matt. This is Alex. Look we remain very optimistic about Pharma in the second half of the year and we continue to see really strong uptake both with DARZALEX and the various multiple myeloma indications earlier utilization. In IMBRUVICA, in lymphoma, again with all the different datasets that we have going out, we continue to see very nice uptake there. We mentioned earlier the strong performance of STELARA, I think up over 23% for the quarter, a lot of that in Crohn's. The other area that we've been really pleased with that is showing growth I believe at around 13% 14% is our long-acting anti-psychotics TRINZA in particular. We've continued to see uptake go well there. The Actelion integration thus far has gone very well under leadership of both Paul and Joaquin, teams are working I think very smoothly together and as alluded to earlier, Actelion overall is meeting and/or slightly exceeding some of our expectations. We're certainly putting in a big premium on minimizing or eliminating any disruption and in fact looking for ways to grow these areas and appropriately, but in even higher growth rate as we indicated earlier in some of my comments. And then when you compound that with the launch of TREMFYA in our Immunology Group and the lapping of some of the earlier PPA's that we're talking about, I think give us confidence in the back end. And then of course if we go one step further out and you combine that with some of the new data sets that we expect in the back end of the year and as we head into early '18 around Esketamine and the transform data, Thalidomide in prostate cancer, a continuing stream of data with DARZALEX, its first line multiple myeloma and IMBRUVICA first line in the obese CL and then the COMPASS data with Xarelto, we think that again all these will be reinforcing the great profiles of these compounds and provide even additional sources for growth. Matt Miksic : Got it. That's very helpful Alex thanks and then on devices, understanding that you're addressing some of the competitive gaps as you mentioned that you have in spine and the different kind of business there is a lot of competitors there now you're one of the market leaders. If we look at ortho and general surgery it seems like the trends into Q2 here were on the margin just slightly more favorable potentially and I wanted to get just your thoughts qualitatively on the tone of those businesses, the trends in price or whether any qualitative comments you would make just on what you see here sequentially from Q1 to Q2? Alex Gorsky : Yeah Matt, thanks. Look we think the core businesses in our ortho, excuse me in our broader hospital Medical Device Group, we think continue to show good performance and we mentioned earlier EP was up around 14%. The launch of the SMARTTOUCH catheter continues to go very well. Our Vision Care business in particular showed really strong growth and again even with the transition, the acquisition with AMO you're seeing over 7.5% growth in our contact lens business, which when you think about the job that that team has done, Ashley McAvoy and the rest of her group over the past several years, competitively the launching of new products, the OASYS ASTIG lens that is in the launch phase as we speak and now augmented with the surgical business and Tom Frinzi and his team are doing a really nice job on coming on board. I just had a chance to visit those businesses. They're doing particularly well. If we look across surgery, even in wound closure, we saw growth of about 3%. Energy and Endomech are in the 3%, 4%, 5% range. You have to keep in mind that we did have an impact from selling days where we don't anticipate that we're seeing major share shifts. We're seeing some movement, but overall, I think we are quite competent. We do have some areas that frankly we need to do a better job in such as aesthetics and ENT that we mentioned. Spine certainly, we're focusing a lot and we're more optimistic at the back end of the year based upon some additional Viper line extensions that we're coming out with as well as an expandable cage. And if you look at core orthopedic such as Hips and Knees if you look -- particularly at the U.S. business, we saw Hip grow over 5% in the U.S. business and if you also add on for our selling days, we think we're doing very well gaining share of the Stem along with the anterior approach. It create a nice opportunity. The ATTUNE rollout, again if we adjust for selling days, we're seeing good performance. We're going to have some additional launches in the back end of the year for that platform. And in sports also put in a really good quarter as well based upon some more recent introduction and we think trauma overall, we're in line. The TFNA launch continues to go well. So, we certainly have areas where we should and we need to do better, but we've also got a lot of core platforms in that group that are performing with a very solid performance overall. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Dominic I wanted to understand the guidance in the acceleration in the second half of this year, a little bit better on the last call in the first call you had an organic underlying sales growth of 3% to 3.5% in 2017. Based on my math, it looks like that's about 2.7% today based on the reduction that you talked about earlier, that would imply by my math about 4.5% growth in the second half versus about 2.3% in the first half if you adjust for the PPA. Hopefully you can follow along with me, but I'm trying to understand that and in Pharma, Dominic it looks like the first half grew about 4.5% once you adjust for the gross to net adjustment. Are you expecting that type of growth in the second half? In other words, the acceleration is more just about moving past the gross-to-net adjustment or could you actually do better than the 4.5% underlying in the first half and I just have one quick follow up for you Dominic. Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well Larry, I think your math is pretty straight on. If you exclude acquisition divestitures and this purchase price adjustment that we've spoken to at length, first half is about 2.4% and on a similar analysis for the full-year, underlying growth might be about 3.2%ish. So, 4% back half of the year versus 2.4% first half of the year. All three of our business segments are expected to accelerate growth. Pharma will benefit not only from the easier comps from the first half to the second-half, but obviously we talked about the things that Alex mentioned earlier with lower erosion for Remicade, uptake from the launch of TREMFYA, better performance in STELARA as well as XARELTO despite some setbacks in pricing for INVOKANA. So overall, we think Pharma will continue to accelerate and medical devices and consumer are expected to accelerate as well, primarily driven of the fact that most of the launches in both of those business are planned for the second half of the year. We've already seen some launch of course in the Vision Care business, but in the base hospital Medical Device business a number of new launches as well as easier comps because of no impact of a lower selling day in the back half. In Consumer, as I mentioned earlier, although they will accelerate new product launches, we're excited about the markets there are somewhat softer and some economic trends in China and India are impacting our expectation there. So somewhat muted for the back half versus our previous expectations, but overall the acceleration to about 4% growth for the second half of the year, excluding acquisition divestitures and this purchase price adjustment is about right. Larry Biegelsen : Hey Dominic just for the record, that 3.2% you said that the old guidance was 3% to 3.5% underlying sales excluding acquisitions that has to be lower today? Dominic Caruso : It is lower today and the 3.2% I was using your analysis, which excluded this purchase price adjustment. So, you're right, the 3% and 3.5% is now lower maybe 2.5% to 3%, but adjusted for this purchase price adjustment it exceeds 3%. So, I was just trying to keep apples and apples straight. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Alex Gorsky : Good morning. David Lewis : I just wanted to start with a strategic question for you and then a quick follow-up. So, it start out with consumer, there is a general concerns out there in the consumer industry about brand risk whether it be Amazon or Millennials. How are you feeling about the durability of sort of key consumer franchises and I know the consumer still remains the smallest piece of corporate profit. Do you still think that's the appropriate mix and I had a quick follow-up? Alex Gorsky : Look we still remain very bullish long-term on the brands that we currently have and a lot of it David gets to the fact that our brands are rooted in science. And I think a key differentiator for our OTCs but as well as our beauty franchise, oral care is the strong science that we have behind all these different areas. And then that of course helps translate in a very strong brand images and while we have seen some recent slowdowns in some of the markets as Dominic mentioned earlier, we think at the end of the day we're still going to need products to fill all the channels and having great innovation and innovative products is going to be essential. As far as our overall mix as we said in the past, look we don't have a particular algorithm. We look at opportunities as they present themselves in each way or in each different sector. We think we made some pretty significant investments last year in consumer at Vogue. I just had a chance to go down and visit that group and again when you look at the rate, the pace of their innovation and our ability now to globalize that platform, we're quite excited about it and to expand it into other areas outside of hair care. So, we still think consumer represents a very solid opportunity going forward. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. Maybe I'll just stick with strategic there for a second. Dominic, you mentioned further assets, maybe it was Alex, further opportunities for asset divestiture to drive other income and then Alex in your commentary in devices I sensed you specified certain markets that you haven't talked about before. So maybe just help us understand two markets struck out for me. What's the strategic commitment to the aesthetics business? It seems like kind of an undersized business for J&J we could go either way. And then you mentioned ENT in this call, which I thought was sort of interesting. Is that an area where you could be interested in expanding through acquisition? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Yeah, thanks David. Look, if you look over the past few years, I think our esthetic business had done a very nice job of actually improving the performance. There's recently been a broader dynamic with some of the side effects seen that have tempered the growth in that market. So, it's one where we're going to continue to watch very closely. ENT has been one frankly of competitiveness, but our team has done a nice job of addressing that. We're in the midst of some launch as we speak and so we'll be watching that obviously closely in the back half of this year and as we head into early '18. Joseph Wolk : Great. Next question Manny. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. So, one, just following up on the earlier question around pricing, can you just break out how much of your U.S. growth quarter was driven by price versus how much came from volume? And then my second question relates to the COMPASS Data, which you mentioned one of the key events for the second half of the year. I think we're just trying to get a better sense to I think it was trying to give a sense of the -- how you think about the potential impact there given that there is three arms of that study, which stopped early. How does you think about as we hear the results in a few weeks here, how much more important is that if you see a benefit from the group withdrawal to only rest of the group or is there Ortho is added on therapy and if you maybe just give color on how you think about that, thank you? Alex Gorsky : Sure. So Vamil with respect to price, if you look at our entire business it's a little bit I guess messy because of the prior period price adjustments, but let's take those out of the mix for this discussion. If you look our domestic form price was down about 2% overall and on the entire business was down about 8% overall. Worldwide price was similar to that as well. So, a little bit better volume than price this particular quarter. And then with respect to COMPASS, what I would say there is largely around the patient population, the expansion of the entire Explorer Program. So, with CAD and PAD, we obviously have the chance to expand the market by about 10 to 12 million patients here in the U.S. What we're currently indicated for is about seven to eight million patients. So, you can see significant opportunity and if you take the entire Explorer Program, it has the potential to be 30 to 35 million additional patient. So, it's a matter of market expansion. We don't believe that our competition has anywhere near as robust a clinical development program as we do for all of those indications that we're seeking and so we seem to be in pretty good position. We continue to take share from Warfarin. So, we were up as we said in the earlier comments more than 2% in terms of total market share versus this time last year. Vamil Divan : Okay. All right. Thank you. Alex Gorsky : You're welcome. Next question Manny. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Thank you very much. Alex you alluded to the fact that you're in Washington and I'm just asking do you need to take a more defensive posture while you're there having meetings or is it one of an offenses nature? And then I have one follow up. Alex Gorsky : Thanks Tony. No, look we're spending a lot of time doing is making sure that we're educating lawmakers with facts regarding the overall healthcare system as well as obviously the important role that pharmaceutical and medical devices as well as consumers ultimately play. And as you heard my earlier remarks as relates to Pharma it's making sure that we understand that it is about 15% of healthcare. We think it's a really important part of healthcare when you look at overall benefits, making sure that they understand the intricacies of the system as you heard in earlier comments, it is complex. And so, we think it's very important to be constantly taking them through the data, the information so that ultimately, we can have the most informants policy decisions. Tony Butler : Thanks very much for that and then Joe or Dominic, just two brief product related questions. One and for INVOKANA I recognize the relabeling effect and managed Medicaid rebates, but did you find that the total category did grow despite those effects because sometimes they can bleed to the entire category. And second, does your full year earnings guidance Dominic include the opt in R&D expense that would be included for a door shift from Actelion. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Sure Tony. Let me take the second question. Yes, consistent with our previous guidance update, which we provided last quarter to include Actelion we've maintained the assumption in that guidance and as you update guidance that we would exercise our option with respect to Idorsia product that we have the rights to we're optimistic to see those results and discuss those results with the FDA and that option is not exercisable until we complete those particular steps. But of course, we're expecting that we will complete those steps in a favorable manner. So, our guidance does in fact impact include that extra R&D expense associated with opting in on that particular product. Joe? Joseph Wolk : And Tony, with respect to Invokana this market the way we define it excludes metformin. By our projections it grew about 3.5% in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just had a higher level question for you Alex or Dominic as we just think about your calling for growth acceleration in the second half of the year, but as we move into 2018 how do we think about the sustainability of that for its acceleration profile, particularly since you should have increasing competition on the REMICADE side of things. And I believe in 2018 as I see it goes off patent, but please remine me is that's the case. There is something within the underlying growth trends in some of the other businesses that could sustain this growth acceleration trajectory or how should we be thinking about that? Alex Gorsky : Yeah Danielle, thanks for the question. So obviously we expect that the growth acceleration in the back half of 2017 will create some momentum going into 2018 of course, right because the majority of that growth acceleration in both Hospital Medical Devices and Consumer have to do with new product launches and we expect that that momentum will carry over into 2018. You're right, there are some puts and takes with respect to some competition as well as patent expiration issues like ZYTIGA, which you just mentioned, but remember the overall farm portfolio remains strong. Joe talked about the COMPASS data with Xarelto and IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX continuing to move upward in an upward trend and gaining share with more data and obviously the entire immunology portfolio now is bolstered by the earlier launch of guselkumab or TREMFYA and so that's exciting and able to propel growth further. So, we expect that although there may be some puts and takes, we're not prepared to talk about guidance. Now for 2018 we expect that momentum to continue. Joseph Wolk : Yeah Danielle, what I would add to that are a couple things. One is I think it really starts with the unmet need that exists among our core platforms. So, if you look at penetration rates in areas for example in our pharmaceutical group, in areas like psoriasis, Crohn's disease, you're seeing treatment rates of only 20% to 30%. If you take a look at even treatment with next-generation anticoagulants, you're only around 50%. If you look at antipsychotics, long-acting antipsychotics, thereto you're looking at in the vicinity much smaller below 20%. So, we think that there is just a lot of unserved need in each of those categories it's going to allow for growth. Secondly, when you look at the data stream that we have coming out across all these platforms, again whether it's XARELTO, whether it's a continued launch uptake of TRINZA, the great date for STELARA in Crohn's disease, the TREMFYA launch we think that's going to add momentum. And then you compound that with the Actelion acquisition, the reasons why we believe that we can reach more patients and generate additional growth, it gives us a lot of confidence in our Pharma group for growth potential going forward. And then certainly we'll be in the events that you mentioned, but underlined that's why we're going to be launching 10 new brand between now and 2021. We think we have $1 billion potential, several of them with over $3 billion and $4 billion potential. A long list of other line extensions I think 50, a of which we think have about $0.5 billion potential and so that's our Pharma group and our Medical Device Group, we mentioned more than 12 launch that we have in the back end of the year combined with some of the other work that we've done around making us more effective, more efficient. And then you compound that with some of the acquisitions that we've done, really in each of our major platforms over the last 12 months and project that going forward. Things like AMO, things like the expandable cage in spine, Megadyne that I mentioned earlier, we think that also provides us a very solid opportunity for growth going forward. Then of course in consumer, we're very excited about the Vogue acquisition, about neo-strata combined with -- we're very confident that we will see positive trends going forward. So again overall, we think that the rest of 2017 and 2018 while we're not providing any guidance, represents a great opportunity for J&J. Joseph Wolk : Thanks Danielle, next question. Operator : Yes, the next questions is from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning, Alex. Hi Dominic. Just talking about the device pipeline Alex, one thing you haven\u2019t talked about more so is the robotic program. Can you update us on where you are? I think there is a working prototype of this system in December. What's next, is this all on track from your point of view and just if you can update us there. I appreciate it, thank you. Alex Gorsky : Yeah the short answer on that Rick is we are quite excited about our Computerized Surgery program. Everything up to this point in time is on track. We're continuing to make really good progress. We had outlined earlier there are reasons for excitement. We think that there's an opportunity there not to just actually improve the surgery itself, bring data to bear in the operating room, having much more flexibility and modularity in the system that we would introduce. And of course, we think that also offers a great opportunity for the rest of our surgical care business as part of an entire system and offering. So, it's on track but what I would tell you is stay tuned. We're obviously not going to provide too much information on that right now given the competitive environment but we still remain very committed to that program. Dominic Caruso : And Rick, the working prototype was already available at the end of last year and in fact Alex, actually tried it out. So, we're not behind there. We're actually on track with that working prototype. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Hi thanks very much for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. First Alex I would love to get your prospective on emerging market growth and the outlook for J&J's emerging market growth going forward and maybe specifically could you just comment on what the end growth was this quarter for you guys and were there any stand out like there were last quarter where devices I think grew almost close to 10%? Alex Gorsky : Yeah, thanks a lot Bob, but overall if we look at emerging markets performance for this quarter, we saw a growth of around 4%. Sequentially it was a little bit slower, but again it was a couple of things. One, we mentioned earlier consumer, we had issues with the demonetization and some lingering policy issues as it related to our consumer business. We saw some competitive issues in China, but overall for example, our Medical Device business was up over 10%. So, we saw strong investment in China, excuse me, total emerging markets, we saw that kind of growth. We've got to get through some of these policy issues in India related to demonetization. There's some in the way that OTC in Pharma drugs are being distributed that we've got to get through in China. The other markets can be impacted frankly at their economies to a certain degree by how reliant they are on petroleum. But overall for the next several years we think emerging markets in particular brick represent a significant opportunity other than those things that I just mentioned. I don't think we've seen significant issues that would affect our outlook. Bob Hopkins : Great. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned earlier about the changing guidance related to potential divestitures and incremental $500 million gains. I was just wondering if there is any more color there? Are these potential divestitures, several smaller deals, is it one bigger one, is it more device, more consumer, more Pharma, just any more color on those in which would be helpful, thank you. Alex Gorsky : Yeah Bob, let me provide as much color as I can without obviously jeopardizing potential value we expect to get from these additional divestitures. So, they're not of any major consequence. So, the ones that are of major consequence which haven't yet closed for example, the Codman Neurosurgery business that's still on track to close this year that was in our original guidance, that's one of the most significant of the group, but not an additional divestiture although we hope that that will actually close at a bit higher value than we previously estimated. The rest are across multiple businesses, I would call them smaller brands, I'll call them not of any major consequence and we'll have to see whether we can get the right value for those assets before we actually execute on them, but that's our plan for them for the remaining part of this year. But not any more detail and I'm sure you can appreciate that. Joseph Wolk : Thanks Bob. I think we have time for one more question Manny. Operator : Yes. The final question is from Damien Conover of MorningStar. Please go ahead. Damien Conover : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question on ZYTIGA and just wanted to follow-up on the higher utilization by the Independent Patient Assistance Foundation. I know it started in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter here. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on why that is continuing and why is prostate cancer one of the focus points for these particular groups? And then second question was wondering if you could also give us an update on your outlook for the amortization expense for the rest of the year. I know it's going to be increasing with the closure of the Actelion deal, thank you. Alex Gorsky : So, thanks for the question Damien. With respect to the Patient Assistance Foundation, as we stated previously, those are independent foundations. So, they really do operate distinct from Johnson & Johnson. So, our insights and data around that is very, very limited. What I can say with respect to ZYTIGA is it actually goes back to probably the fourth quarter of last year where we saw a significant bump Bob and we've got some statistics that suggest our prescriptions for ZYTIGA last year this time that ran through the foundation, we're about 4% of total prescriptions. Now they're up to about 15%, but the good news is we've seen a leveling off. So, in the last couple quarters where we've commented to this impact, it's been around that 13%, 14%, 15% level. So, we think there's a leveling off as to why these are more utilized and maybe some other foundations that's probably related to some funding that went dark for some other foundations, but again that's pure speculation on our part because these Patients Foundation Assistance programs are run independently from Johnson & Johnson. Dominic Caruso : Yeah Damien, earlier I gave you some after-tax impacts of intangible amortization expense that are in this year's earnings, were adjusted from this year's earnings to arrive at our adjusted earnings. The pretax number so far just for the second quarter was $480 million and the pretax number in the same quarter of last year was $326 million. The largest impact of that increase is obviously the AMO acquisition because of course we had a full quarter's worth of amortization there and only couple weeks worth of amortization of Actelion. So, going forward, the Actelion acquisition will add substantially to the amortization expense, but as you know our practice is consistent with all those in our industries to exclude that from our adjusted earnings because it's obviously a non-cash impact. So hopefully that helps you model going forward. Damien Conover : Great. Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Great. So that concludes the question-and-answer session. Thanks for your questions as well as your continued interest in Johnson & Johnson. I will now turn the discussion back over to Alex for some closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, everyone for making time to be on the call this morning and I want to end where we began with a few thank you. First of all, to really thank all the associates at Johnson & Johnson for their ongoing commitment to our credo, to being competitive and ultimately to producing the results that we just had a chance to review with you this morning. And also, a big thank you to all of you for your continued trust and confidence in Johnson & Johnson. We look forward to updating you at upcoming calls as we work our way through 2017 and with that I'll close the call and look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello, and thank you for joining us to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the third quarter of 2017. I am Joe Wolk , Vice President of Investor Relations. I would like to provide a few logistics for today\u2019s call.  This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 75 minutes. Please note that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  I am very pleased to be joined by a few members from our executive committee, Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide some prepared remarks prior to the Q&A portion of the call. You will not only have the opportunity to pose questions to Dominic during that time, but also to each of our segment leaders. Accompanying Dominic and I on today\u2019s call are Joaquin Duato, Executive Vice President Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Jorge Mesquita, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer, and Sandy Peterson, Executive Vice President Worldwide Group Chair. We are very pleased with our strong results as highlighted in this morning\u2019s press release and accompanying materials, the third quarter demonstrated an acceleration of organic sales growth and continued robust adjusted earnings per share. The anticipated acceleration of sales performance was most pronounced in the Pharmaceutical segment where key major brands are penetrating new markets and gaining share. The Consumer segment returned to growth in the face of relatively soft global categories and worldwide medical device growth was relatively stable to second quarter levels. Sales performance in the quarter reflects the contribution from recent acquisitions, as well as the strength of new products across all three segments.  Now, on to the details related to this quarter\u2019s results. Worldwide sales were $19.7 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 10.3% versus the third quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales were up 9.5% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8%.  In the U.S., operational sales growth was 9.7% and regions outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of 9.3%. The effect of currency exchange rates positively impacted reported OUS sales by 1.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth for the enterprise was 3.8% worldwide.  Net earnings for the quarter were $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.37 versus $1.53 a year ago. Excluding after-tax amortization expense, and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.90 representing increases of 11.2% and 13.1% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2016.  On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.1%. Dominic will provide additional commentary on our earnings in his remarks. I\u2019ll now summarize segment sales performance for the quarter with the intent of building upon the slides being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2016 and thus exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Consumer segment, worldwide sales grew 1.6% to $3.4 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales increased 1.1% worldwide. Operational growth in this segment was driven by the Beauty and OTC franchises, each growing 4.4%. The results in Beauty were driven by strong OUS performance in the Vogue and NEUTROGENA brands. Additionally, the Dr. Ci:Labo brand in Asia-Pacific is experiencing good uptake. Franchise growth excluding acquisitions was 2.1%. The worldwide Beauty market is estimated to have grown approximately 3% in the quarter and was modestly up in the U.S. In our OTC business, adult and children\u2019s TYLENOL continue to gain market share with adult TYLENOL benefitting from strong sales of the rapid release formulation. Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care continues to be impacted by the new entrants to the market. However we\u2019ve remained the market leader. As previously communicated, we are actively working on relaunching these brands in 2018.  Regarding our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales grew 14.6% to $9.7 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational adjusted sales grew 6.7%, a clear acceleration of the growth over the first half of 2017. The strongest therapeutic area of growth was in oncology growing 24% overall. DARZALEX continued its robust performance with rapid uptake in the one prior line setting. DARZALEX growth in EMEA drove results outside the U.S. with the product has now been launched in 25 countries. IMBRUVICA continues to gain market share globally. As you are aware, data lags for this product, but based on second quarter data, IMBRUVICA is now above 50% market share in the U.S. across all approved indications. ZYTIGA growth in the U.S. was driven largely by a growing market which we estimate at approximately 13% and a slightly higher share both versus the prior year and sequentially. In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 7%. STELARA in the U.S. gained 1.8 points of market share in the total immunology market versus the third quarter of 2016 driven mostly by strong adoption for the newer Crohn's disease indication. STELARA market share for the Crohn\u2019s in the U.S. is now estimated to be approximately 10%. REMICADE in the U.S. declined a little more than 1% as it continues to compete in the face of biosimilar entries. REMICADE U.S. export and International combined declined 23%. While we continue to experience erosion from biosimilar competition in Europe, approximately two-thirds of this decline was attributable to the timing of shipments with our partner Merck.  Within the Cardiovascular Metabolic Therapeutic area, XARELTO\u2019s growth of 20% was primarily the result of increasing total prescription market share, up almost 2.5 points versus one year ago. Warfarin continues to decline in favor of branded products.  INVOKANA and INVOKAMET sales in the U.S. declined as we commented to in recent quarters, the primary driver of this decline is increasing discounts for the brand in managed care contracting and higher utilization in the Medicaid channel. There was also a loss in share of approximately one point.  This is the first full quarter we are reporting pulmonary hypertension product results. On a pro forma basis, this therapeutic area grew 9% globally, 16% in the U.S. and 1% outside the U.S. Worldwide pro forma growth of better than 17% in OPSUMIT was driven by further market penetration and share gains. UPTRAVI up more than 70% and still largely a U.S. product is experiencing strong launch demand. TRACLEER was down about 14%, which is expected as business converged to OPSUMIT.  To conclude the review of pharmaceuticals, I would like to provide additional context on a few of our late-stage compounds that were mentioned in today\u2019s press release. A new drug application for apalutamide was submitted to the FDA for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The filing was based on Phase 3 data from the Spartan trial which met its primary endpoint. We plan to present the study results at a major medical meeting in 2018. Regarding talacotuzumab, based on a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee we have discontinued treatment with talacotuzumab in AML 2002 as the phase 3 results did not demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio. We continued to assess the data to determine next steps in the clinical development program.  Lastly, we have made the decision to withdraw the applications we had filed globally for sirukumab in rheumatoid arthritis. We are continuing to study sirukumab in major depressive disorder currently in Phase 2.  I will now turn to our Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion growing 6.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.2% worldwide. The Vision Care business continues to exhibit strength. Contact lenses grew 5.3% worldwide as new products namely OASYS 1-Day and OASYS 1-Day for Astigmatism continued to be well received in the market. Within the contact lens other line, there is $27 million associated with the recently acquired Consumer Eye Health products. The Vision Surgical business on a pro forma basis grew approximately 10% driven by the cataract business in the U.S. where strong adoption of the IOL TECNIS SIMPONI lens continues.  We did experience a modest negative impact in our Hospital Medical Device businesses from weather-related events during the quarter. Based on a very preliminary analysis, we estimate that impact to have been a modest 30 basis points to overall total in this growth.  Dominic will discuss this impact in the outlook of our future supply continuity in a few minutes. We\u2019ve routinely referenced general selling days. On a worldwide basis, selling day impact this quarter was negligible. Within Hospital Medical Devices, electrophysiology grew approximately 14% worldwide largely in line with atrial fibrillation procedure growth. The Advanced Surgery category grew 3.9% or 2.2% excluding the Megadyne acquisition. Energy is facing competitive pressures from reprocessing alternatives. Growth was largely generated by 13% OUS biosurgery performance with strength in the Middle East and Asia Pacific markets. Endocutters grew 6% outside the U.S. driven by ECHELON performance in China. Within general surgery, worldwide sutures grew approximately 5% behind strong growth of traditional and barb sutures in China. The decline in specialty surgery was driven by share loss in the aesthetics and infection protection businesses. The decline in orthopedics business versus the third quarter of 2016 was largely the result of share loss in U.S. Spine. We are working to expand our product offerings in faster growing segments. Performance in Knees outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by new legislation in India which is lowering the pricing of implants. That impact was approximately $10 million in the quarter, but since the legislation is retroactive to the beginning of the year, the third quarter represents three quarters worth of negative impact.  Trauma grew 3.1% driven by solid growth in the U.S. market and strength in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Hips round out the orthopedic portfolio and that platform grew 1.5% globally as strength in the U.S. was driven by continued adoption of CORAIL.  Pure pricing pressure continues across most orthopedic categories but favorable mix helped offset the erosion. For the quarter, U.S. price net of mix was negative 2.6% in Hips. Spine and Trauma net of mix were positive 2.1% and 1.2% respectively. Knee price net of mix was flat.  That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter of 2017. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred during the quarter. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Joe and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. The performance highlights the many areas of strength in our business that have given us the confidence to stay throughout the year that we would accelerate sales growth in the second half of 2017. That was exactly what we delivered in the third quarter. We experienced organic growth acceleration most significantly in the Pharmaceutical segment as oncology and immunology products continued to grow at robust levels. The Consumer segment, which declined modestly in the first half of 2017 grew in the third quarter, while Medical Devices was relatively stable, but as Joe noted, experienced a minor negative impact to growth due to hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In addition, we are very pleased with the performance from our recent acquisitions Actelion and Medical Optics which will continue to fuel our growth.  And so, overall sales beat analyst estimates by approximately 2% or $350 million and adjusted earnings beat analyst estimates by $0.10 per share. I know for many of you there are questions regarding the impact of the unprecedented storms that occurred in the quarter.  I want to take a moment to acknowledge the courage and resilience of all those who have been directly impacted by these storms. It\u2019s really been incredible. The response of the global business community has also been impressive and I am especially proud of the role Johnson & Johnson has played. Our desire to improve lives is a foundational element in our credo and it is times like these when the character of our people who have been working on the ground side-by-side with relief organizations, and united effort to help their communities really shines proved.  In terms of sales, the limited impact we experienced in the third quarter is not the result of any supply disruption, but rather lost surgery days in those areas affected by the storms. It remains to be seen whether volumes associated with those lost surgeries will be recouped in future quarters, however, in terms of future supply, we are very well positioned. We have six manufacturing sites on the island of Puerto Rico and considering the magnitude of the storm, our facilities fared well. All of our sites are open with reliable generator power operating in various stages of capacity while the work continues to ramp up to full operations in Puerto Rico.  To ensure critical patient needs are met, we are closely monitoring inventories across our global manufacturing network prioritizing option of essential products and have already begun shipping newly manufactured goods from the island.  While we cannot rule out the potential for intermittent shortages of certain product formats, many of our products have dual production sites and back-up supply outside of Puerto Rico to help meet demand. Based on what we know today, we do not foresee any material impact to future results. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2017. As you heard, our operational sales growth this quarter was 9.5% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational growth was 3.8%. If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures to 2017 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of $1.4 billion on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following.  Intangible amortization expense of approximately $933 million, primarily from the recent acquisition of Actelion, litigation expenses of approximately $100 million, acquisition-related cost of approximately $280 million and a charge for the continuing restructuring of our Hospital Medical Device business of approximately $140 million. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.90, up 13% and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.85 or up 10% over the prior year.  Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods increased by 430 basis points, primarily due to the inclusion of the amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up from our recent acquisitions.  Excluding the impact of these types of expenses in both periods, cost of goods sold was 27.8% or 120 basis points lower than the prior year, mostly due to favorable product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were up 70 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2017, largely through the investment of new products in our Consumer segment. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 13.1%, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year as we continue to advance our robust pipeline of pharmaceutical products. And interest expense, net of interest income was a net expense of $155 million, slightly higher than last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of $236 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $54 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are recorded in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of $517 million, compared to a net gain of $220 million in the prior year period reflecting completion of certain asset sales which were included in our annual guidance.  I\u2019ll provide an update on this activity during my guidance comments. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to the 19.7% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. I\u2019ll also provide an update on tax during my guidance comments. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2017, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the third quarter of 2016 driven by favorability in other income and expense line partially offset by the additional investments I mentioned earlier. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices at 30.1% is lower than the prior year primarily due to higher investment spend to support new product launches. Pharmaceutical margins improved 110 basis points to 41% driven by favorable product mix. Consumer margins improved to 28% primarily due to the divestiture gains, partially offset by increased advertising and promotional spending. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion of net debt, which consisted of approximately $16 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of total debt. Therefore, for purposes of your models and assuming no other significant uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of $600 million and $700 million which is consistent with our previous guidance. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. As you know, one of our business priorities is to actively manage our portfolio to maximize value creation with the intention of redeploying most of those gains back into the business to enhance our long-term growth prospects.  Consistent with our previous guidance, we are still comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. This includes the gain associated with the sale of the Codman neurosurgery business which we closed subsequent to the third quarter. Regarding pretax operating margin, we expect that investment levels will increase and therefore we maintain our guidance that we will be flat to slightly decrease from 2016 level. This is of course offset by the divestiture gains I just mentioned.  And now a word on taxes. As the Chief Financial Officer of one of the largest U.S. based multinational companies, I am often asked these days about perspective on tax reform. In fact, it is a topic I have been actively engaged in for more than ten years with legislators, as well as my peers across many industries.  While our guidance today does not include any assumptions about potential tax reform measures, there are some points I\u2019d like to share as I do believe we now have momentum to attain meaningful and impactful business tax reform in the very near future.  First, we commend our leaders in Washington for taking steps to address business tax reform and we see the united framework as a thoughtful approach to jumpstarting the U.S. economy, fueling U.S. jobs and U.S. investment one that will improve the ability of U.S. multinational companies to compete more effectively.  The current tax system has not kept pace with modern innovation-driven global economy which results in an increasingly difficult business environment for U.S. based companies that do compete globally. To level the playing field with other industrialized countries, tax reforms should include three fundamental elements, a lower corporate income tax rate in line with other industrialized countries, the adoption of a modern, globally competitive International tax system allowing U.S. companies to manage their cash without tax penalty and of course greater incentives for innovation in the U.S.  The framework addresses each of these elements and while clarity and additional detail are still needed in some elements, it is important that Washington and the business community unite now behind a tax reform bill that will have a positive impact on domestic jobs and on economic growth. Having said all that and still remaining optimistic that something on this front can get done, we are not assuming reform in our 2017 guidance. Excluding special items, our guidance is 19% to 19.5% as at effective tax rate and this is a slight tightening of the range from our previous guidance.  Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 does not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT, PREZISTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will of course also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2017 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to maintain the acceleration of our underlying sales growth for the balance of the year, and our major acquisitions of Actelion and Medical Optics completed earlier this year remain on track. As this is in line with our previous expectations, we are maintaining our operational sales guidance for the year in the range of 5.5% to 6%. This translates the sales for 2017 of approximately $75.9 billion to $76.2 billion on a constant currency basis. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as at last week with the euro for example at $1.18 for the balance of the year our sales growth rate would increase by 60 basis points versus our previous guidance.  Thus, under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 6% to 6.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $76.2 billion to $76.5 billion which is higher than our previous guidance. And now turning to earnings. As I noted earlier, we plan to continue to invest in our growth opportunities and those plans are already in place. In the fourth quarter, as we did in the third, we will see an elevated level of R&D investment as well as additional investments in marketing programs behind the launches of several new products. Therefore, we continue to expect our pretax operating margins will decline somewhat from the prior year consistent with our previous guidance.  We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of between $7.22 and $7.27 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of between 7% and 8%. This is a tightening of the range and an increase of about $0.02 over the July adjusted EPS guidance. If currency exchange rates for all of 2017 were to remain where they were as of last week that our reported adjusted EPS would be favorably impacted by $0.03 due to currency movements and this is an improvement from the negative impact of $0.05 in our previous guidance.  Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.25 to $7.30 per share, an increase of $0.10 from our prior guidance and a growth rate of between 7.7% and 8.4%. So in closing, we are extremely pleased with the sales and earnings performance in the third quarter and our higher EPS guidance for 2017.  In summary, we are maintaining our operational sales growth of 5.5% to 6% for the year, consistent with our goal of growing earnings faster than sales, our guidance for operational adjusted EPS growth remains strong in the range of 7% to 8% and our businesses continue to invest for the long-term while also delivering on near term priorities.  So now I\u2019d like to turn things back to Joe to begin the Q&A portion of the call while I am delighted to be joined by Joaquin, Jorge and Sandy to address your questions. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Dominic. So let\u2019s move into the Q&A session. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Joseph Wolk : Yes, we can. Dominic Caruso : Yes, hi Mike. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. Thanks, Dominic. So, Dominic, first item, I just want to clarify for people because it appears to be there is a fair amount of confusion out there. The margin that you reported this morning, the kind of headliner or unadjusted margins this morning, those \u2013 that doesn\u2019t back out the amortization cost and so those numbers that [Indiscernible] are not apples-to-apples, the ones you gave on your comments for more apples-to-apples for [Indiscernible] margins and operating margins, correct? Dominic Caruso : When I am commenting on our results, I am doing so by excluding the special items, the most impactful \u2013 impact of amortization expense, just so we can have an apples-to-apples comparison because of the significant acquisitions we did this year, and that\u2019s right, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Okay, perfect. A couple items I wanted to be touched on, one was, can you give us an update on ZYTIGA? And what\u2019s happening from what you can see with the IPR decision and the trial? And then second, could you spend a minute on STELARA because if we look at the pharma outperformance this quarter, and impart to overall acceleration in pharma from first half to second half.  One of the big stories is STELARA\u2019s acceleration over the last several months driven by the Crohn\u2019s launch. So can you talk a little bit about how that launch is going and maybe the outlook for STELARA going forward, because that\u2019s relative to consensus STELARA was the big outperformance this quarter. Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Mike, let me turn that question over to Joaquin who is here \u2013 as you know runs our Pharmaceutical business. So, Joaquin? Joaquin Duato : Hi, Mike and good morning to all of you. Before I go to STELARA let me give you a couple of [Indiscernible] reflections on how the quarter went. I think when we met in May 2017 on the occasion of the Pharmaceutical R&D review day, we anticipated that the performance of the Pharmaceutical group was going to accelerate during the second half of the year. And that\u2019s precisely what you are seeing today.  You are seeing the pharmaceutical group moving from low single-digit growth in the first half of the year to 6.7% in this third quarter. So clear acceleration of the sales of the pharmaceutical group. That are driven by a number of factors, one is, the momentum that our key brands are gaining mainly driven by market share gains and one example of that that I will talk about this is STELARA as you mentioned had posted very impressive 43% gain in the U.S. in the quarter. The second is positive news on our pipeline. During this period, we have launched TREMFYA, which has been very well accepted by physicians. We have already 900 physicians prescribing TREMFYA about 3000 patients and as we speak TREMFYA, it\u2019s already leading in new to brand share when compared to the new therapies when compared to the anti-IL 17.  And then the third one is that, we completed the acquisition of Actelion and we are now in our first 100 days post integration. You\u2019ve seen the results of Actelion there, very much aligned with the expectations, positive growth and share gains both in UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT. So the combination of these three factors is driving the 6.7% adjusted growth on the 14.6% of total pharmaceutical growth.  This is very aligned on what we discuss in our pharmaceutical review day. When it comes to STELARA, I mean the growth is driven by two factors. First, share gains in the psoriasis market where STELARA is the leading brand in new to brand share in psoriasis and second, very impressive gains also in the Crohn\u2019s disease market where we continue to gain share.  So the combination of our continuous growth and sustained growth in psoriasis plus the launch in Crohn\u2019s disease is driving this growth in STELARA that you are seeing today. Dominic Caruso : And Mike, with respect to the ZYTIGA patent, so I think as you are well aware there is two avenues that are being pursued there. The first was with respect to the court. So the New Jersey Court had set a preliminary trial date for October of this year. However during a status conference as recently as a few weeks ago in September, there is a schedule of pre-trial activity.  So we don\u2019t anticipate that a new trial date will be set until early next year. With respect to the second avenue in the U.S. patent and trademark office, we have not yet received the decision. We understand it\u2019s the U.S. PTO\u2019s right and permission to extend deadlines on that. So we await, we\u2019re just like everyone else. Joseph Wolk : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Matt Miksic : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. So one on pharma if I could just one follow-up on devices. So first, and I guess for Joaquin since we have you here, obviously very impressive results across core franchises excluding Actelion.  I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on \u2013 Mike mentioned STELARA, but how some of the other pieces fit together over the next 12 months specifically new indications, line extensions for key drugs like XARELTO and Dara and some of the other recent filings like apalutamide and how they sort of fit together against the potential increase biosimilar pressure.  And the reason I mentioned in the next 12 months is because that I think investors are interested in seeing how you\u2019ll maintain and extend those PAH Actelion franchise and fit these other pieces together and then sustain your growth going forward and then I had just one follow-up. Joaquin Duato : Thank you and thank you for the question and let me start with the drivers of the growth that we are having and we are seeing in the third quarter and in the second half of the year that you want to continue to see over the next year. Let me start with XARELTO that posted very impressive growth in this quarter of 20% mainly driven by share gains and that we believe will be sustained into next year. You remember that we already share the data of our COMPASS study, and we are planning to file these new indications by the end of the year and that will together with the existing share gains that we have in our markets drive the growth of XARELTO in 2018. XARELTO had the highest share gain in the quarter in the last four years mainly driven because we are starting to put a bigger dent on Warfarin.  So that\u2019s an important driver for us moving forward. If we continue with oncology, both IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX continue to have impressive share gains. IMBRUVICA, as Joe commented has already 50% share across line of therapies and DARZALEX is getting share both in third line, second line multiple myeloma with around 20%, 40% respectively and we plan to file our first-line study, our RTM study by the end of the year. So that\u2019s going to be another positive driver moving into next year as we continue to gain share in different line of therapies. If you recall too this past quarter, we had the approval of the combination with Pomalyst in second line multiple myeloma. So, both IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX will remain important drivers of our growth into 2018.  The other driver that sometimes goes unrecognized but is having an impact, that in the quarter posted 15% growth and we see that continue to gain share in the antipsychotic market as long-acting therapies remain relatively underutilized as compared to the potential of it.  So those are going to be some of the most important drivers moving into 2018. Then, another two important updates on our pipeline. It\u2019s the filing of apalutamide that we just completed and that it\u2019s going to enable us to have - maybe seen that is going to have an indication in patients that have prostate cancer without metastases.  It would be a very important new indication for apalutamide and great option for prostate cancers. We will continue to progress with TREMFYA in psoriasis and also in 2018, we are planning the filing of Esketamine, which we believe would be a very important option for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. So those are the drivers that will continue to enable our market growth in 2018. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s great. Thank you and then, if I could just couple things I think investors are curious about in devices, one, Joe or Dominic on the U.S. knee market, worldwide down obviously, there was some International pricing you mentioned, but any color on what you are seeing here in Q3 and then in Spine, the pressure you talked about portfolio gaps, anything being your position in the market as one of the leaders any comments you had on just the color of that market would be helpful? Thanks. Joseph Wolk : Sure, Matt. So just a little bit of commentary on knees. It was a little bit softer than what we had experienced in recent quarters, but I would say it\u2019s not the 4% that was reported as down. You have some pricing issues, specifically in India with some legislation where we actually book the charges for three quarters, not just the one quarter since it was retroactive back to the beginning of the year.  You also had some weather related impact albeit modest. So you are getting closer to a negative 1 to flat versus the minus 4 that reported maybe for some qualitative commentary with respect to knees and spine, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Peterson : Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. So, I\u2019d just \u2013 couple of general comments and then I\u2019ll specifically answer your questions about knees and spine in particular. As you know, I\u2019ve just recently in last few months taken over responsibility for medical devices and I think in the quarter you will see that we have some clear areas where we are doing very well like EP, wound closure, biosurgery and some parts of our orthopedics portfolio.  But there is some places in the portfolio where the full impact of some of our new product launches and some of our acquisitions have not fully taken hold yet. And as I\u2019ve said to others before, we\u2019ve also spent a lot of time over the last quarter talking about how do we ensure commercial execution on the ground in a much more robust in some of these markets. And I think we are beginning to see the positive impact of that with a lot of our businesses and some account wins that will start having some positive impact for us as we kind of continue through the fourth quarter. And Joe\u2019s comments about knees are absolutely spot on.  We also, I think, there is a little bit of the impact about elective surgeries in parts of the U.S. where we know a large percentage of the volume happens in that southeast part of the U.S. that clearly had some minor impact on the business also in the quarter. We also in Europe, which impacted our business, both our Spine and Knee business.  We had a very unusual one-time impact on our ordering and distribution system that impacted about a week\u2019s worth of sales, particularly in orthopedics. So we are catching up from that but it clearly had an impact in both Spine and Knees in Europe as well as the U.S. And then, the last thing I would say is, our tibial tray, our cementless program as well as we have just completed our first atune revision case in the U.S, and we are still in the soft rollout of that.  But that clearly is going to have a very positive impact on our knee business in particular in the U.S. but as it goes global outside of the U.S. we\u2019ll start seeing the positive impact of that on our knee business as we move forward. So I guess, I would characterize the quarter as a few one-off things that had an impact on the business but generally speaking, the platform is doing very well and we\u2019ll start gaining more momentum as we move forward.  As it relates to our Spine business, we \u2013 if you break it apart and look at the performance overall, obviously we are not satisfied with the performance of that business. We have had portfolio gaps in that business for a while. We are starting to get through those and starting to launch some new things in the business.  But if you look at the business from a regional standpoint, the Asian business and Latin America business had a good quarter and we have things work to do in the U.S. and North America. But you should start seeing some more positive momentum in our Spine business as we go into next year. And in general, I think Spine procedures have been down in the industry overall over the last couple of quarters and that clearly there is a macroeconomic impact on Spine. So, thank you, Matt. Joseph Wolk : Great, next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question will be coming from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. One for Jorge, one for Dominic. So, on Consumer, obviously, everyone have seen the news that Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Health business. What\u2019s the implication if any for your consumer franchise and J&J has been reshaping its consumer portfolio in recent years?  Are you interested in a large deal in Consumer? Do you prefer to continue to do smaller deals in your current category? As I said, I have one follow-up for Dominic. Jorge Mesquita : So, good morning and thank you for your question. Well, as you know, we have a very disciplined and systemic approach to evaluating potential acquisitions and our focus primarily is always on value creation and that\u2019s the overriding criteria that we use to establish whether or not we have an interest in a particular asset. So, as assets become available, we systemically evaluate them, but our focus is always can we create value for Johnson & Johnson regardless of the scale of the asset. And Dominic? Larry Biegelsen : Yes, I wanted to ask about, the puts and takes for 2018. I know you are not giving guidance until the Q4 call. But, anything on the top-line that you would call out versus 2017, but I am more curious about EPS and how we should be thinking about the incremental Actelion accretion in 2018. It\u2019s probably about an incremental $0.30 or so. And I am curious if that we should expect to see that on top of your normal 6% to 8% operational EPS growth or you will reinvest some of it? Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Larry, look I think, we\u2019ve previously described the first full year of accretion for Actelion to be $0.35 to $0.40 a share. We have said that this year\u2019s accretion is going to be about $0.07 a share. So, you are right, I mean, you get to a place that\u2019s just under $0.30 of potential additional EPS accretion from that acquisition.  As we always do, we are evaluating all our plans right now in determining where is the best place to invest. What the businesses have in terms of launches of new products and what they have in terms of their own momentum and we want to continue to invest behind new product launches. So it\u2019s too early to give you an expectation of how much of the accretion from Actelion will fall through versus how much will be invested.  But suffice it to say, we generally, as you know, grow our sales, we\u2019ve aimed to grow our sales faster than categories we compete in and we aim to grow our earnings at a rate faster than sales. So we will continue to do that and we will give you a clear picture of that as we set our plans for 2018 when we talk in January. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Larry. And the next question, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Hi, thanks for taking me very much. Just wonder if you can just give us a little bit more color on DARZALEX. I guess, unless you talk about in the U.S. so you have better information hopefully, just your market share in the lines of therapies that you are in and what kind of duration of therapy you think you are going to get to in those lines? Thanks very much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. So, as far as DARZALEX, as I commented, our market share in third line plus is in north of 40% in the U.S. already and in second line, depending on the shortage, generally north of 20% and it continue to grow. Our \u2013 the trends that we are seeing in the market are very positive, particularly after the approval in one prior line and the data we presented in one prior line and also as I commented earlier, we already finished the study in first-line in combination with BMP and we are planning to file before the end of the year.  So, all is positive on that side. Importantly, we are also working as you guys know, in developing a subcue formulation and we are going to start our phase 3 study with the subcue formulation this year. So, increasingly we see that DARZALEX becoming a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma and that\u2019s the feedback that we are getting from customers. Jeff Holford : And then just one quick follow-up if I can on Actelion. I mean, Dominic, I think just talked couple of times about how accretion from this deal can be delivered pretty quickly. Just wondering, for 2018, do you think you will give us some kind of update on the level of accretion that really will drop through from this in 2018 and whether there is any potential upside to the $0.35 to $0.40 that you previously talked to? Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Yes, Jeff, when we talk in January, we\u2019ll obviously point out the impacts of Actelion and actually all of our acquisitions on growth. So we\u2019ll give you an estimate of organic growth and therefore you will be able to see the impact of acquisitions and on the bottom-line, we\u2019ll talk about the impact it has to our overall earnings picture and also any major investments we plan to make. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jeff. Next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Maybe just, Jorge, starting with you, maybe a couple for Joaquin. Just, Jorge, just strategically since you got to the company, you really saw some very impressive improvements in the consumer franchise earlier last year and that has flowed in the near term.  There are lot of strategic questions investors have about the impact of the Amazon on the broader consumer business, the impact of Millennials on brands. Other than just making some of the investments you\u2019ve talked about, is there a change in the strategic focus for this business for you based on some of these sort of macro pressures or is it just continuing to do that the prior plans, strategically how well do you think you are positioned now versus when you first joined J&J? Joaquin Duato : Thanks very much for the question, Dave and it\u2019s a very good one. I mean, there is no doubt that the broader CPG industry is seeing a change in the competitive landscape and there is a fundamental shift here enabled by digital technologies and we see the rise of a lot of small companies that are now competing with the large established companies in this field. But in the fate of it, I am very confident that our strategies are absolutely the right one for us to continue with what we\u2019ve had for a number of years which is a strong sustained run of market share growth.  We have to make some adjustments in terms of the operational focus of those strategies. In particular, we have to drive accelerated growth on the online channel and we are doing just that. We are growing, we estimate at this point, at twice the rates of the broader online channel with our e-commerce capabilities. We are investing very heavily in leadership, in systems, in capabilities in general and for sales fundamentals online, so that we drive our share of e-commerce to match our offline share. So, there are some adjustments we are making, but overall, the broad strategic focus that we have had and that\u2019s driven our results for the last few years remains very much in place and we feel we are very well positioned. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful and then Joaquin just two questions from me on pharma. First is, ZYTIGA\u2019s strength this quarter, how much does that have to do with the patient assistance programs disconnects me part of the year resolving and how should we think about that franchise growth going forward?  And the second question is just talacotuzumab, you talked about this at the Analyst Day potential multi-billion dollar opportunity. Can you just give us a little more detail with this safety issue, efficacy issue and what\u2019s the future path going forward for talacotuzumab? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. Thank you for the question and ZYTIGA strength in \u2013 it\u2019s been mainly driven in the U.S. by the combination of market growth and share gains. So that\u2019s the reason we have had these ZYTIGA strength in the U.S. David Lewis : Joaquin, just an \u2013 the Patient Assistance Foundation still hasn\u2019t anniversaried yet. Would you expect that in the fourth quarter? So that was actually about a four to five point headwind to growth in this quarter. Again, these are independent organizations, so it\u2019s hard to predict what may happen, but we didn\u2019t see the incremental lift from the sequential quarter from Q2, but it is still a significant comparator when you compare to last year\u2019s Q3. Joaquin Duato : So that\u2019s the source of the strength of ZYTIGA is the market is growing and also we continue to gain share and price overall including the effect of the third-party foundations continues to be a negative for ZYTIGA. What has been new recently is the presentation of the latitude data which was very well received by the customers and by patients with very significant results in increasing overall survival and radioactive progression free survival in patients that the - where metastatic but get hormone na\u00efve.  So this is the first time that a medicine is tested in this indication and we are filing in this indication in the U.S. and in Europe and some other fact in Europe we received a positive opinion for the CHMP recently. So that is the major driver of ZYTIGA growth is higher market penetration combined with share gains across the port. Regarding talacotuzumab, I mean, as Joe commented, we discontinued talacotuzumab based on recommendation of the IDMC in AML based on the safety risk benefit ratio and we are now evaluating that data and using those revenues to see which other indications we may pursue in the future. So it is still premature to comment on what else we would be doing with talacotuzumab. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, David. Next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just one clarifying question and then one question for Sandy. First just to clarify, the impact on the hurricanes on the medical device growth is there was 30 basis points. Is that global or U.S. and it wasn\u2019t more pronounced in certain areas of hospital med tech versus others? Dominic Caruso : I would say, Bob, the best way to classify that is a very preliminary analysis. We looked at some zip codes to see what particular metropolitan areas might have been hit that were indirect line of the storm. But it\u2019s mostly \u2013 it would be a U.S. phenomena obviously because it was related to surgery days and not anything to do with supply disruption. Bob Hopkins : So, but the 30 basis point was the impact on worldwide hospital med tech growth? Dominic Caruso : Correct. Bob Hopkins : Not U.S., okay. And then, the bigger picture question for Sandy, just on the outlook for pricing in hospital med tech, because we\u2019ve been noticing that whether it\u2019s China or Australia or India, it just feels like governments in these countries are sort of taking a harder line around med tech pricing and it could be something that impacts growth going forward. So just curious to get your views on how big of a concern is this for you as you look at the hospital med tech business growth outlook outside the United States? Sandy Peterson : So, thanks for the question. Our sense of it is, it\u2019s in some of these markets, it\u2019s an episodic thing that happens and it\u2019s not that unusual over time, but I think what we are also finding, I guess the punch line is we are concerned about it.  But not terribly concerned about it because we have been able to go and work with many of these governments and hospital systems to find ways to provide incremental value to them beyond the physical product alone and that\u2019s a ways for us to actually be able to deal with some of these questions about pricing.  Now, obviously, the situation in India, this one-time price impact on knees clearly has an impact on the marketplace in that regard and I think that\u2019s sort of a much more extreme example of what we\u2019ve seen in other marketplaces which were a lot more moderated and we have the opportunity in some cases to have broader conversations with them and it\u2019s part of why we have changed our business strategy to really show up as an integrated business talking to them about a number of different things beyond purely the physical product going forward. And so that\u2019s how we believe are going to address this question when it arises in OUS markets. Joseph Wolk : Hey, Bob, maybe just to pick up on that point for the benefit of those on the call. If you look at our price contribution to the enterprise results, it was actually about negative 2% and it was a slight positive price impact in consumer, slightly negative in medical devices and where we actually saw some price decline or price erosion it was about 3% in the Pharmaceutical sector and that translates to about 2% down for the entire enterprise. So it speaks to the strength of pharma that it really came from volume, market share related types of improvements. Rob next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Another question for Sandy. J&J has been reshaping its device portfolio for several years now selling diagnostic, selling cardio. I know you are strategically looking at diabetes. So I was hoping you give us an update beyond what you said on ANIMAS most recently.  And then, as you look at the portfolio, and I know you've only been there a short time, but are there other areas when you analyze the portfolio that may be divested? And then as you look at the portfolio, are there areas that you see that that may be helped through M&A? So long question and then I have a follow-up on utilization in the U.S.? Thanks. Sandy Peterson : So, thanks, Glenn. So, I\u2019ll start with \u2013 you have seen the actions we have taken regarding our portfolio. But I think the most important thing is, all of the actions we\u2019ve taken to invest in the platforms that we believe have significant growth and we\u2019ve been doing this both in terms of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and investing in R&D. So if you look at our \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve made a significant bet in our neurovascular business where stroke is a huge unmet need and it\u2019s only growing. And so we now have a business due to some things we get internally as well as a couple of acquisitions in the last 12 months. So, you should see us over time build that business the way that we have built the EP business.  So, it\u2019s an important growth driver for us as a company. Obviously, in our core orthopedics businesses, we have been making acquisitions, small tuck-in acquisitions plus investing in technology as well as innovation and you\u2019ll see us continue to drive that. The most obvious significant one in the last year is all of the investments we have been making in vision to broaden our portfolio in vision care.  So we did three acquisitions this year to broaden the depth and breadth of our vision portfolio. So I think you should think about this as a combination of where do we see growth in the business. Whether it\u2019s in core surgery, whether it\u2019s in orthopedics, whether it\u2019s in vision care or what we call now interventional. You should expect to see us continuing to make those investments and over time, as we make choices about other parts of our portfolio, we\u2019ll let you know when we make those choices. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Anything on - no update on diabetes other than the announcement on anti mos, is that correct? Sandy Peterson : Right. Joseph Wolk : The question was on utilization? Glenn Novarro : Yes, yes, Joe. If I look at your U.S. surgery business, I look at your U.S. orthopedic business, it be coming lighter better than we expected and it looks like in the third quarter, there was a step-down slightly negative growth versus positive growth in the first half. So, I was wondering if you can provide commentary on what you are seeing in the U.S. with respect to utilization?  Is there any impact from fewer sign-ups with ACA? Is there impact occurring because of high deductible plans being purchased? So, any color as to why we saw some weakness in either your business or utilization in the third quarter? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : What we are seeing in the line is, and again this is very preliminary for the third quarter but pretty much on par with hospital machines being down maybe 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Surgical procedures from our lens looks to be down about 2.5% and then lab procedures are remaining flat sequentially up about 2%. Thanks for the questions, Glenn. Next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a few quick ones for pharma. On INVOKANA, it looks like the quarter performance was a little weak. I want to get your perspective from the field. Now that it\u2019s been a few months since the Janus presentation ADA. How much of the sequential drop would you attribute to pricing? And what that looks like going forward? And then on apalutamide, I just want to get the J&J perspective on kind of the cost benefit, the profile have stacks against ZYTIGA.  Obviously, down the road you\u2019ll be competing, it\u2019s a generic. So that\u2019s obviously a different sort of sales cycle on that. And then maybe a bigger picture on prostate. You guys have had good data and pre-metastatic has extended. Just want to get your perspective on the tipping point really for broader urologist adoption. Thanks guys. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, and let me start with INVOKANA. INVOKANA first continues to be the leader in prescriptions in the ALD2 category. So it\u2019s still the leader in the SAT2 category. When it comes to this quarter, we show a decline, and the decline was mainly, mainly driven by price and also we saw a fair impact since we included the black box warning in our label.  So it was a combination of mainly price and some share declines due to the black box warning. As we move forward, we see opportunities with INVOKANA. The first one is we just file our main indication based on the campus data and that\u2019s going to be important for us moving into 2018 and the second one we continue to progress with our CREDENCE study in patients with diabetic nephropathy in order to evaluate how their kidney function progresses.  So those are two elements that make us confident of the future of INVOKANA moving into 2018. Regarding apalutamide, we are super excited of being able to continue our leadership in prostate cancer with apalutamide. I mean, it\u2019s been great that we have been able to file recently for this indication as you commented this is going to be the first time that these agents are indicating in patients that have no metastases. To your question of ZYTIGA, I think you are aware that in metastatic prostate cancer what we are analyzing it\u2019s a combination of apalutamide and ZYTIGA compared to ZYTIGA. So, that would be transformational if we are able to demonstrate that superiority. So that\u2019s how we see the market moving forward and as you are also aware we have alliances of with PARP inhibitor in the area of prostate cancer that we are studying now that we plan to file in this indication in 2018 that eventually we will combine with our androgen anti-androgen agents.  So we\u2019ll have a full line of products in the area of prostate cancer from the non-metastatic to the metastatic indications combining apalutamide, ZYTIGA and eventually Niraparib. So we feel very confident about the options that we are bringing to those patients and also we feel very confident about how competitive our offering is, which is being demonstrated by the share gains that you have seen in this quarter and about our speed in being able to complete the apalutamide trials and file for that. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Rob, next question please? Operator : The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Joaquin, maybe you could just follow-up on the question related to INVOKANA. What are you seeing with the SGLT2 class? Are you losing share to Jardiance because of the amputation warning? And you talked about price, how should we think about this franchise going forward? INVOKANA was one of those drugs that had such a spectacular \u2013 now it\u2019s a negative territory down 20% this quarter.  How should we think about the growth of this franchise going forward? Would you anticipate price continues to be a thorn or is this more of a step down and sort of a rebalancing or rebasing and would you expect to see the SGLT2 cloud start to pay some share? And then I have a couple follow-up questions for Dominic, thanks. Joaquin Duato : So, to your first question, yes, we are losing share to the other SGLT2 agents since we introduced the box warning in our label. We remain the leader of the category, but we are losing share, particularly in new patients. Certainly, the price has been even a bigger driver in the step decline that you have seen this quarter. Our belief in INVOKANA moving forward is based on the very positive data that we have submitted in MACE and the overall risk reduction that we see in utilizing INVOKANA and also in the study that we are conducting, the CREDENCE 1 in patients with diabetic nephropathy evaluating their renal function. So, overall, we see the SGLT2 category and INVOKANA bringing important benefits and we continue to see INVOKANA as an important brand for us moving into 2018. Jami Rubin : Okay, thank you. And Dominic, just a couple P&L questions. I think you had said that currency has now swung from minus five to plus three, so that\u2019s an 8 percentage point benefit. So should we assume that most of the top-line and bottom-line guidance increases, not all but most \u2013 the majority is related to FX.  And then secondly, on the net or on the other income line, that\u2019s a line that, I know you are going to give us guidance in 2018, but it\u2019s very hard for us to analyze, because it fluctuates so much depending on asset sales. I mean, going back in my model, this is a line item that was more in the sort of $500 million, $600 million range and now it\u2019s $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion.  There was a year when it was $2 billion. Can you just give us kind of a big picture view in terms of how we should think about this line going forward, because obviously it\u2019s become a driver to earnings? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Yes. Hi, Jami. So first of all, on the FX question, you are correct that the increase in our guidance is partly due to of course a different outlook on FX on both top and bottom-line. So I think that\u2019s an accurate assessment. With respect to other income, here is a good way to think about it. I mean, we have consistently talked about the fact that we intend to actively manage our portfolio as we\u2019ve been doing that over the last several years.  And in doing that, we will make a determination whether the asset is better in our hands or better in someone else\u2019s hands, and once those decisions are made we do include in our overall guidance for the year our expectation on this other income line which is difficult for anyone to forecast.  So, unless we can \u2013 and that\u2019s why we give you our expectation and you can see that we are pretty much in line with the expectation we gave you from the beginning of the year with respect to the asset sales that we think would occur this year and therefore be part of our overall expectation from the very beginning. We are executing on those. The way to think about this is, we don\u2019t expect that our work in evaluating the portfolio is going to diminish. We are going to continue to do that. We are going to make sure that assets are better either in our hands or in someone else\u2019s hands and when you look at the other income line in your model and you see it increase, please take also a look at pretax operating margin which is after COGS and SG&A and R&D, and you could see that that margin at the same time decreases which goes to the point that I made earlier that when we do this, it\u2019s a portfolio decision.  So we are increasing our investment in R&D, SG&A et cetera, at the same time that we are recognizing these gains. So, they are not really drivers of earnings, they are really drivers of investments in the portfolio and so take a look at that and as I said earlier, we expect to complete this group of asset sales this year in our guidance.  But I said earlier when we talked last quarter, that I would not expect that this line item would drop off significantly in 2018 and therefore that allows us to keep our investment levels up high going into 2018 as well. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Jami. Rob, next question please? Operator : The next question is coming from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning and thank you. I just had two quick questions for Joaquin. First, on this REMICADE the biosimilar readiness plan is installed as been effective, you\u2019ve been highly successful in contracting in 2017, but just wanted to get your input on if anything changes within the REMICADE defense strategy with a second biosimilar mark into 2018 in terms of continuing to secure wins with your innovative contracting model and I just have one follow-up. Joaquin Duato : So, thank you for the question and important thing here is to understand the dynamics on the REMICADE and in the immunology biologics market overall. I mean, the key factor for REMICADE being successful is the fact that physicians and patients have a high confidence and trust in REMICADE based on more than 2 million patients treated and 16 indications.  There is no other medicine as a study has experienced as REMICADE is. And the second factor which is important to recognize is that these medicines are not interchangeable and sometimes, this element is lost in the debate. These medicines are not designated as interchangeable by the FDA. So in other words, they are not like generics and they are not the same.  They are biosimilars but not the same. So, having said that, what we are seeing in the marketplace that the physicians are very reluctant to switch stable patients for REMICADE into other medicines. And that is normal, I mean, because in many of the indications that REMICADE is used, particularly in the most frequent one in gastroenterology these biosimilars do not have any data to show for.  So, the most important factor in the success of REMICADE is the physician and the patient experience and the body of data that supports using REMICADE on the lack of interchangeability. Now, we continue to compete vigorously in price and we continue to drive reductions of course for the overall system based on that.  And as a matter of fact, the price of REMICADE has decreased year-over-year when you look at the net price. So, when we move into 2018, we are going to continue to work along the same lines of making sure that physicians have the option to continue to use REMICADE and making sure that they are aware of the body of data and the experience that they have had during the last years in which they have been able to have these therapeutic options.  So that\u2019s really the base of our 2018 plan making sure that physicians have the option to prescribe REMICADE and making sure that patients that are stable that can benefit from REMICADE can remain in REMICADE. Josh Jennings : Thanks again. Just a quick one on XARELTO in the COMPASS trial. It\u2019s still early days post-data, but any preliminary thoughts on how to maximize capitalization on the coronary peripheral artery disease opportunities? Thanks a lot. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question. I mean, as I said, XARELTO has had terrific share gains during this quarter. It\u2019s the highest share gain in the last four years and that, well we are very pleased with the COMPASS results has nothing to do with the COMPASS results because as you know, COMPASS population, the coronary and peripheral arterial vascular disease is a different one and XARELTO will be used in a different dose. So all you seeing in XARELTO today is driven by our existing indications particularly atrial fibrillation and VTE treatment and prophylaxis. So, moving into 2018, we are filing this year for the COMPASS data as I commented. So we see significant opportunities in COMPASS. It\u2019s a 6 to 7 million patients that can be treated \u2013 is the total population and we believe that the profile of XARELTO based on the data of the COMPASS trial is going to be extremely competitive and that\u2019s going to be one of the drivers.  This is only one of the study that are included in our excluded program that contains multiple indications seeking the studies in congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, medically ill patients that would continue to drive the growth of XARELTO in 2018 and after 2018. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Josh. Rob, it looks like we\u2019ve got time for one more question? Operator : Yes, your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Yes, thanks very much. The immunology section for J&J has been a tremendous grower or even since you date back to the acquisition of Sinacore in the 1990s, but one of the things that you\u2019ve recently done is that you\u2019ve backed out sirukumab in RA. So I am curious outside of the products you have on the market today, is there anything to back fill into RA that you have in the portfolio?  And number two within immunology, can you comment on how sirukumab has been received with payers? And if I may a third, in for IMBRUVICA for GVHD, Joaquin would you say that that\u2019s a large market opportunity for you and if so how large? Thanks very much. Joaquin Duato : Okay, so, we \u2013 let\u2019s say, it\u2019s important for me to remind that when it comes to the discussion of sirukumab or talacotuzumab, those were setbacks but our outlook of continue to drive above market growth through 2021 remains more surely than before based on the growth of our existing brands and the progress that we have had with several key elements of our pipeline like TREMFYA, apalutamide, and Esketamine.  So that's an important theme for me to remind. When it comes to immunology, we are the company with more assets in this category. We have four approved assets, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and TREMFYA. Are we disappointed with sirukumab? We are, because we stand behind sirukumab and the value it has as an anti IL-60. The additional data request that we were having the complete response letter would have delayed the introduction of sirukumab significantly and based on the competition that exists there with other anti IL-6, we thought the best thing for us is to focus on other priorities. I mean, TREMFYA, it\u2019s been very well received by physicians and by patients.  As a matter of fact, as I commented, we already have 900 physicians prescribing TRMFYA in 3000 patients and as we speak it\u2019s the leading the new to brand share in psoriasis when you consider new therapies anti IL-17. What about the payers? Look, this is a very competitive market in this category and we feel confident that we will have appropriate access moving into 2018.  We\u2019d be negotiating that access in this part of the year and when the formula is come for 2019 we feel good that patients that want to use TREMFYA, physicians that want to use TREMFYA will be able to use it and will be able to prescribe it. So overall, as we discuss, we see that even in immunology, even considering the erosion that we are going to have with REMICADE, we are going to continue to post positive growth in immunology based on the strength of STELARA and on the strength of TREMFYA moving forward. Joseph Wolk : Great. So that concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. Thanks to everyone for the questions and continued interest in Johnson & Johnson and apologies for those questions we weren\u2019t able to address today.  I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Dominic for some brief closing remarks. Dominic Caruso : Well, thanks, Joe. And as I noted earlier, we are very, very pleased with our strong third quarter performance. And I am also glad you had the opportunity to hear directly from our business leaders, Sandy, Jorge and Joaquin who are doing a terrific job in leading our strong businesses and delivering very, very strong results.  We owe our strong performance and therefore our thanks to the very talented colleagues we have around the world who continue to bring innovative solutions to patients and consumers.  So, thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our full year results in January. Have a great day.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello. I am Joe Walk, Vice President of Investor relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company\u2019s review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.  Joining me on today\u2019s call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. We are very pleased with our 2017 fourth quarter and full year results. Once again, the performance illustrates a track record of consistent growth exceeding financial expectations and making progress on our long-term strategies.  As we guided this time last year, sales for the business accelerated in the second half of 2017, based largely on the strength of our Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices. 2017 also marked a year in which we complemented our existing portfolio with significant acquisitions and many collaborative agreements. These are some of the factors that contributed not only to our superior total shareholder return for 2017, but the more than 225% returns since the end of 2011 exceeding major indices, as well as our competitor composite over that span.  As we enter 2018, we are confident that our Pharmaceutical business will remain strong and anticipate our Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve resulting in solid financial performance, while delivering innovations that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers, and consumers. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules.  Please note that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation, as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  In terms of today\u2019s agenda, I will begin with a review of the results for the corporation and three business segments; Alex will then reflect upon our 2017 performance and share his perspectives on Healthcare and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s drivers for growth in 2018. Dominic will conclude by providing insights on the income statement and our guidance for 2018. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last 90 minutes. Now, on to our results.  Worldwide sales were $20.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 11.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales increased 9.4%, as currency had a positive impact of 2.1%.  In the U.S., sales were up 9.8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 9%, as currency favorably impacted our reported OUS results by 4.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 4.2% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S. and 4.3% outside the U.S. For the full year 2017, consolidated sales were $76.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% compared to the full year of 2016. Operationally, full year sales grew 6% with currency having a positive impact of 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 2.4% worldwide, 1.6% in the U.S. and 3.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, there was a net loss of $10.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was a loss of $3.99 versus earnings of $1.38 a year ago. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, the company did record a provisional charge of $13.6 billion for recently enacted tax legislation, which is treated as a special item.  In response to requests many of you had after our third quarter call, and to facilitate a transparent understanding of special items, we have included on our website a schedule that details special items labeled Net Income and Diluted EPS GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.  Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74 representing increases of 9.5% and 10.1% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.7%. Regarding the full year, 2017 net earnings were $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.47. 2017 adjusted net earnings were $20 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $7.30, up 6.8% and 8.5% respectively versus the full year 2016 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7.6%.  Dominic will provide additional details about earnings in his remarks.  Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2017 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion, growing 0.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 0.2% worldwide. The Beauty franchise grew 2.4%, driven by U.S. share gains in body and hair care attributable to new products, Maui Moisture and OGx within our Vogue portfolio and gains in ecommerce. This growth was partially offset by increased trade promotion spending for NEUTROGENA products. Over-The-Counter Medicines grew globally 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth of 6% outside the U.S. was driven by strong performance in upper respiratory, primarily driven by TYLENOL and BENADRYL in the Asia-Pacific region and the RHINOCORT acquisition. The decline of 3% in the U.S. is largely due to the fourth quarter 2016 restocking we commented to last year regarding retailer inventory reductions earlier that year and some minor supply disruption we faced following Hurricane Maria out of a Puerto Rico facility, which has now been fully remedied.  Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care down 2.4%, continues to be impacted by new entrants to the market. As communicated in the past, despite remaining the market leader, we are actively working on relaunching these brands in 2018 and you will hear more details regarding this at our May 16th Business Review Day featuring our Consumer and Medical Device segments. Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $9.7 billion grew 15.5% excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, an acceleration of growth over the third quarter of 2017. The therapeutic area with the strongest growth was in oncology at 36%. In Oncology, DARZALEX grew 82% versus the fourth quarter of 2016 and surpassed $1 billion in sales for the year. DARZALEX continues to increase U.S. market share in lines two and three, and experienced market growth in the line four plus setting. OUS sales were driven by strong uptake in the EMEA and LATAM regions. IMBRUVICA grew 45% worldwide, driven largely by higher market share and market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. and strong uptake outside the U.S. in the EMEA and ASPAC regions.  In the U.S., based on third quarter data across all lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 5.5 points of market share and the CLL market, based on third quarter data grew approximately 14%. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth was also significant led by U.S. growth of 61% versus the fourth quarter of 2016.  Clinical data from the d LATITUDE study continued to drive both market growth and market share. The total metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market is estimated to have grown 25% in the quarter and market share for ZYTIGA at 37% is four points higher than the same period last year.  In Immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 9%. STELARA in the U.S. gained two points of market share in total Immunology and 11 points in the Crohn\u2019s Disease market versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately, one-third of STELARA\u2019s fourth quarter sales are in the newer Crohn\u2019s Disease indication.  One other note on STELARA, growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately ten points in the U.S. related to additional rebates associated with prior quarters in 2017. As we discussed in the past, actual rebate claims do experience a time lag and original estimates for prior quarters required an adjustment due to the rapid utilization uptake we are experiencing with STELARA for the Crohn\u2019s indication. REMICADE in the U.S. declined more than 8%, as we continued to compete in the phase of biosimilar entries. While this is more of a decline than the modest levels of erosion we experienced during the first three quarters of 2017, demand was relatively stable and the erosion was primarily driven by negative price. REMICADE U.S. export and international businesses declined as erosion from biosimilar competition persists in key markets. To conclude Immunology, we are very pleased with the uptake of TREMFYA launched for moderately severe to severe psoriasis in the third quarter of 2017. Sales totaled $47 million in the fourth quarter and the product is already the new to brand share leader when accounting for both IMS Claims Data and internal data on samples.  In Neuroscience, the Paliperidone long-acting products performed well with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency for INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in the U.S. and TREVICTA outside the U.S.  My comments regarding results for the pulmonary hypertension assets acquired from Actelion in mid-2017 are on a pro forma basis. This therapeutic area grew 3% globally, 12% in the U.S. and declining 8% outside the U.S. Strong demand for UPTRAVI, which also benefited from a wholesaler inventory build and OPSUMIT was partially offset by two items, first, the expected decline of TRACLEER outside the U.S. due to generics and second, the transition of patient assistance foundations. Within the cardiovascular and metabolic therapeutic area, INVOKANA declined 34% in the U.S. Similar to prior quarters; the primary driver of the decline is increasing discounts. There was also a loss in share of approximately one point.  XARELTO\u2019s growth of almost 19% was the result of increasing total prescription market share, up almost 2.5 points versus one year ago. Warfarin continues to decline in favor of branded products.  I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $7 billion, growing 6.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted sales growth was 2% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Vision Care and Cardiovascular, as well as improving growth in surgery. However, Orthopedics performance was below where we aspire to be, and we continued to decline in diabetes care. Strong Vision Care results were driven by contact lenses, which grew 6% globally in the fourth quarter as the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day portfolio and new variance of the ACUVUE DEFINE had strong adoption. On a pro forma basis, the Vision Surgical business grew approximately 5%, driven by the continued uptake of Tecnis Symfony in the cataract IOL category. Underlying demand for cataract business approached double-digits for the quarter. Electrophysiology within cardiovascular grew almost 20% worldwide, which is the ninth consecutive year of double-digit growth for that business. Atrial fibrillation procedures are estimated to have grown approximately 13% worldwide. Our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters are responsible for modest share gains. Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew globally 14%, primarily driven by strength outside the U.S. from uptake of new products in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are also experiencing some benefit to the fourth quarter OUS growth from a competitor\u2019s supply disruption. Biosurgery grew approximately 8% worldwide, largely due to performance in topical absorbable hemostasis products. In General Surgery, suture growth was more than 4.5%. Barbed sutures are experiencing strong adoption and new World Health Organization guidelines recommending our Plus suture product drove performance in China, India and Japan.  Specialty Surgery declined 4.3%, as the Infection Prevention and Aesthetics businesses underperformed versus the competition. Within Orthopedics, we are disappointed with the year-on-year declines in the knee and spine businesses as we continue working to improve portfolio offerings in faster growing segments of those markets. Hip growth of above 2% appears to be slightly ahead of our projected market growth for the fourth quarter. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in Orthopedics, but was largely offset by favorable mix. For the quarter, U.S. price inclusive of mix was negative 3% in hips, U.S. price inclusive of mix for spine, trauma and knees were all positive at 3.9%, 1.4% and 0.8% respectively. We were often asked about utilization in the U.S. hospital setting, so let me conclude the Medical Device segment providing that information. For the third quarter, we saw a slight decline in hospital emissions of about a 0.5%. Surgical procedures were down approximately 3% and lab procedures were up about 2%. Our preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter indicate the same rates for surgery and lab procedures with admissions improving to flat. That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2017. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter including the agreement with Legend Biotech for a CAR T-cell therapy candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We are pleased to be here sharing the strong results we delivered for 2017. Not only did we exceed the financial performance metrics we set at the beginning of last year resulting in superior returns for our shareholders, but we also delivered on the commitments and responsibilities defined in our credo. Total shareholder return for 2017 was more than 24%, which is exceptional exceeding our competitor composite, as well as exceeding most major indices.  And not only is that true for 2017, but I am proud to say that this is also been the case for the last three, five, ten, and 20 year periods. Our shareholder return for 2017 is indicative of the strength of our business, as well as the strategic focus and execution that our leaders and teams have delivered over the past several years. Our Pharmaceutical business has been an industry leader in all performance measures including R&D productivity and continues to deliver strong top-line growth while simultaneously increasing investments to further develop our incredibly strong pipeline of innovative new medicines. Our Medical Device business continues to refine and accelerate its pace of innovation, while also implementing novel commercial models to meet evolving marketplace demands. In our Consumer business, despite a global category slowdown in 2017, we maintained our 2016 share gains in many major categories and improved adjusted income before tax margins further, while also investing in our products via traditional platforms in newer digital vehicles. As you have heard me say before, while we are pleased with our recent performance, we are not satisfied. Going forward, we are committed to meeting the full potential of both the Medical Devices and Consumer businesses. Our track record of strong shareholder returns is also the result of our approach to managing for the long-term. Our relentless drive for innovation, our disciplined portfolio management and our capital allocation strategy, all of which are regularly discussed as part of our ongoing strategic planning with our Board of Directors. We believe that sustaining investments and innovation is the most important aspect of our strategy. In 2017, we achieved record levels of investment. We invested $10.5 billion in research and development, and $35 billion in M&A, which resulted in a number of value-creating acquisitions and collaborations including Actelion, the company\u2019s largest acquisition to-date, which added a sixth therapeutic area to our Pharmaceutical business and Medical Optics, which continued to fuel growth and establish leadership in the eye health space.  In total, we completed 16 acquisitions and licenses of various sizes, 60 innovation deals and made 21 new investments from our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation during 2017. In 2018, we will continue to enhance our status as a preferred partner being agnostic to where the best science and technology resides and aggressively pursuing transformational innovation.  We understand that ideas come from everywhere and the collaboration is a critical step in unlocking new treatments for patients and solutions for our consumers and customers. A great example of this is our collaboration with Legend Biotech, a company in China that we are partnering with to develop a truly breakthrough investigational CAR T anti-cancer therapy for multiple myeloma, which remains an incurable disease for many patients. CAR T cells are an innovative approach to eradicating cancer cells by harnessing the power of a patient\u2019s own immune system. We are excited to combine our expertise in multiple myeloma with the emerging biotech industry we are seeing in China and we are hopeful that by applying shared knowledge and expertise we can work on building regimens aiming for our tier. We kicked off 2018 with our announcement of 15 new collaborations to drive the development of novel solutions that can impact healthcare. They focus on addressing areas of unmet need and include exciting new areas such as the use of AI to detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease earlier, identifying throat cancer through a simple saliva test and harnessing the microbiome to treat sleep disorders. As our portfolio evolves through innovation, acquisitions and growth initiatives, we also regularly evaluate each of our existing businesses to determine if they still fit our strategy and our criteria for value creation. As a result, and as you\u2019ve seen us do, when it makes sense we undertake a process to consider different ownership for a business might be value-enhancing or if a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio. This process also ensures that we continue to invest in the most promising areas of our portfolio where we believe we can make a significant difference for patients and consumers and create greater value for our shareholders. In 2017, we announced that we\u2019re evaluating our strategic options for businesses. In addition to continuing this work, we executed four divestitures in 2017 including the Codman Neurosurgery business. Although we made these strategic divestitures, we strengthened our commitment to stroke treatment as evidenced by the launch of CERENOVUS.  This portfolio includes aneurysm coils, vascular reconstruction devices and other technologies used in the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms and stroke, a market we see growing faster than the average in Medical Devices. Our activity reflects our capital allocation priorities which have remained consistent and we believe proven. After funding our internal growth initiatives, R&D and SG&A, our estimated free cash flow for 2017 was $17.8 billion. Our next priority in our capital allocation strategy is delivering a competitive dividend to our shareholders and in 2017; we paid $8.9 billion in dividends which has increased for the last 55 consecutive years. After meeting our dividend goals, we target value-creating M&A and major licensing deals.  And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs, and given our financial strength, we have the demonstrated ability to do all of these things simultaneously.  Over long periods of time, more than half of our free cash flow has been returned to shareholders. As the world\u2019s largest, the most broadly based healthcare company; we understand the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity.  As I think back on how far we\u2019ve come, the investments we\u2019ve made in healthcare innovation have yielded some amazing returns. We are in the final stages of creating the first vaccine for HIV AIDS and we are driving towards the end of the vertical transmission of AIDS in Africa. We are winning to fight against drug-resistant tuberculosis. We are enabling important breakthroughs against pulmonary arterial hypertension. We are advancing spinal care for patients who suffer from debilitating disc disease with our interventional spine technology. We enabled enhanced ability and mobility in knee replacements via novel joint reconstruction technology. We offer the convenience and ability to utilize acne care treatment technology at home.  We are enabling consumers to digitally scan their skin via a smartphone app and receive in alerts as to provide personalized skin care advice and product recommendations. We are delivering ecommerce vision care solutions that enable consumers to manage their eye care online. Clearly, we have a track record of producing advancements in healthcare that saves and improve people\u2019s lives for over a century and people depend on us to continue making new discoveries. We\u2019ve recognized this. We also recognize that we must find new solutions, faster than ever before. I believe that to drive the change in healthcare space that people want and need, we must have a sense of urgency. This requires us to actually re-imagine Johnson & Johnson as a 132-year old startup, one that embraces and acts on the best ideas that is nimble and fast, that leverages technology to drive life-changing and life-saving innovation and one that focuses on being competitive always via transformative products, quality services, and transparent pricing, all with the consumer top of mind. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be in the business of healthcare. Cures and treatments reaching the market today are not only improving the quality of life for many patients, extending life for others, and contributing to the productivity of our society, but they are also helping to reduce caregiver burden and healthcare spending in other parts of the system such as hospitalizations. Healthcare is a monumental part of each and every one of our lives. It affects all of us in a deeply personal way, whether it\u2019s our own health or the health of the loved one, and healthcare is equally important and significant from an economic standpoint. It accounts for 18% of U.S. GDP. The pharmaceutical spending is one widely discussed component accounts for about 14% of the overall healthcare spending in the U.S. As such, it\u2019s important to be clear on how we view our responsibility for the patients and stakeholders served by our products. We believe that investing in innovation to focus on unmet medical needs that create differentiated products to ultimately help people live longer, healthier and happier lives is our first responsibility.  We believe a more value-based healthcare system has tremendous potential to improve the health of populations, increased access to care, and limit cost. We are working with others in the healthcare system to transform the way healthcare is paid for. So everyone involved is held accountable for the value they deliver. At the same time, we are taking steps in today\u2019s system to advance a more value-based approach.  We have entered into a number of value-based contracts and we continue to explore new opportunities such as outcome-based contracts, which are tied to clinical endpoints as well as contracts that share risk with managed care organizations and contracts tied to offset other healthcare expenditures. We are also committed to responsible pricing. When we price a new medicine, we consider the value of the patients and society, the importance of maintaining affordable access to medicines for people who need them and the importance of preserving our ability to develop future groundbreaking cures and treatments.  As our 2016 Janssen U.S. Transparency Report demonstrated, we have maintained responsible approach to pharmaceutical pricing generally limiting our aggregate annual price increase to single-digit percentages below those of our competitive set.  For 2017, the net price for pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is negative, a topic you\u2019ll see more details on when we issue our 2017 U.S. Transparency Report later this quarter. Transparency is just one of the ways we can demonstrate how serious we are about responsible pricing. We look forward to continuing our work with government officials, our customers and other stakeholders to ensure we continue to provide differentiated, value-based and affordable healthcare to people around the world. Healthcare reform is a major public platform and we remain proactively engaged in this discussion. To be clear, we support Bipartisan steps that will expand access to affordable healthcare and improve long-term sustainability of the U.S. Healthcare System while fostering a competitive market and incentivizing R&D investments behind new treatments, innovations and cures. From our view, there is several areas for possible Bipartisan agreement, some of which include, the continued funding of cost sharing reduction payments, strengthening the insurance risk pool, and allowing state flexibility. Outside the U.S., healthcare systems are evolving as well and we will continue to be the champion for improving patient outcomes, and investing in healthy societies around the world. We know that when governments invest in healthcare, they see return on that investment in the form of worker productivity, economic growth and stability. We are pleased with the final passage of legislation to modernize the tax code for American businesses, which can further jumpstart the economy and fuel job creation and that\u2019s good for all Americans. Some of the elements included in the package are provisions that will allow companies like Johnson & Johnson to have greater flexibility and how we can use overseas earnings to invest for the future, improving the abilities of companies like ours to bring these resources into the U.S. and elsewhere fuels growth and ultimately strengthens the company overall. Changes to corporate tax rates will help improve the overall competitiveness of U.S. companies. The tax modernization effort moves the U.S. closer to a territorial system and we believe that is good for the economy.  Finally, in terms of direct benefit to Johnson & Johnson, we believe as the world\u2019s largest healthcare provider one of the most meaningful deployments of the benefits from the most recently enacted tax legislation is to invest in innovation to address significant unmet healthcare needs for society and we plan to do just that by making increased investments in innovation with the intent to have those substantially made in the U.S. while benefiting the globe. In just a few minutes, you will hear more details from Dominic on the new U.S. tax legislation and the direct impact on Johnson & Johnson. As the healthcare system landscape continues to evolve, so too does our business. But despite these changing dynamics at an enterprise level, we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. In the near-term, we are focused on meeting our financial and quality commitments, keeping our credo obligations that everything we do must be of high-quality, quality is paramount across Johnson & Johnson and it\u2019s worth noting the great progress we\u2019ve experienced with our supply chain over the last few years improving quality, optimizing costs and leveraging capabilities globally that enable further innovation in all parts of our business and help us operate from a position of strength. In terms of our financial performance, we expect each of our three business segments to continue to grow and contribute to our sales and income growth in 2018. We recognize the importance of innovation in all that we do and innovation will continue to be at the heart of our efforts to meet the needs of patients and consumers. We are well positioned to continue to lead the way, leveraging both internal and external resources to execute our strategies. And our commitment to innovation is highlighted by the fact that Johnson & Johnson ranks among the top five companies in the U.S. and the top ten companies globally for R&D investment across all industries. We have not only demonstrated our commitment to driving innovation from an investment perspective, but we\u2019ve also demonstrated solid productivity that has resulted in positive patient and consumer outcomes as exemplified by our pharma business.  In our Pharmaceutical business, our priorities remain fairly consistent with what we stated in recent years. We will drive continued growth while delivering on our near-term pipeline. We will do this by focusing on our six therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine and strong commercial capabilities.  For 2018, we expect our key catalysts for growth will include, expanding the profile on key life-saving and life-changing products, such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA enabling a best-in-class uptake of TREMFYA, which was approved in last July in the U.S.  And last November in the EU; the continued contribution of Actelion sales; securing regulatory approval for Apalutamide in the U.S.; submitting NMEs and line extensions which include esketamine, Erdafitinib, and Apalutamide in the EU six significant line extensions including OPSUMIT CTEPH. We are on track with launching the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline. In 2017, TREMFYA was approved for psoriasis. In 2018, we expect approval for Apalutamide and we will file for the approval for esketamine in treatment-resistant depression.  In addition, we expect to file for the approval of seven more products by 2021 for a total of ten, like we told you last May, each with more than $1 billion peak revenue potential. Although we\u2019ve had particularly strong performance in pharmaceuticals, we realize that we have more work to do in further accelerating the Medical Devices and Consumer businesses.  Our near-term priority in Medical Devices is to accelerate growth through innovation, portfolio management and new business models. We continue to strengthen the foundation and simplify operations.  We are also reshaping our business and portfolio in anticipation of and in response to dramatic changes the industry and our customers are experiencing, which include aging populations, increasing chronic diseases, health system consolidation, alternative sources for healthcare and increasing expectations of patients related to pricing, products and efficiency. 2017 was a transition year. We stabilized and invested in the commercial organization, improved quality, execution and competitiveness, filled many critical portfolio gaps, and built new platforms, services, and digital solutions.  Our goal is to continue the top-line acceleration we saw in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and we plan to drive that growth by, building world-class commercial capabilities across the portfolio; globalizing our operational footprint and talent; developing robotics and digital surgery solutions for orthopedics, surgery and interventional; maximizing new market growth opportunities and platforms such as stroke and in care delivery locations beyond the hospital; delivering a forward-looking pipeline to meet consumers\u2019 eye health needs across their lifetime and building a premium surgical channel of superior intraocular lenses; and offering competitive capital equipment platforms in both cataracts and refractive. While we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in our Medical Devices business, we know there is still a great deal of work ahead of us to ensure that we are poised to consistently deliver value in 2018 and beyond.  And in our Consumer segment in the near-term, we will concentrate on enhancing our leadership and priority categories by focusing on critical geographies and our iconic mega brands.  Our plans for Consumer growth in 2018 include, broadening the scope of our innovation model with breakthrough global platforms, such as the light-based pain therapy device, continuing steady growth in Aveeno Baby, rapidly expanding ecommerce and scaling perfect store, building our portfolio through insight-led innovation that delivers superior science and differentiated products that are professionally endorsed and relaunching the Baby franchise with new formulations and new packaging to meet the purchasing preferences of millennial parents. I am confident about the strategies that our Consumer business is putting in place, but we also recognize that to drive value and lead in the market, we will have to stay focused, continue to evolve our capabilities, and deliver solutions that drive growth. These compelling strategies and strong results would not be possible without our talented, diverse and dedicated employees around the world. Today, we employ approximately 134,000 global employees with more than 43,000 jobs right here in the U.S. Our purpose-driven, credo-based culture puts people first and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees. We believe employers have an opportunity and responsibility, as well as an incentive to ensure their employees are healthy and engaged. Our goal is to lead by example by cultivating the world\u2019s best, healthiest and most engaged workforce from programs that encourage healthy eating movement resilience, to ensuring the financial health of our employees through competitive compensation programs, as well as providing important benefits to support healthy families.  We believe these programs help us achieve our goals of attracting, developing and retaining the best talent to deliver the best outcomes, positioning us to deliver another 132 years of strong and continued growth and shareholder returns. I am also pleased to share another important accomplishment that was recently announced on this front. Johnson & Johnson has once again made the Fortune Most Admired Companies List for 2018. I\u2019d say with great pride that we are ranked in the top-20 and we are the number one pharmaceutical company worldwide on the list. We are proud of the results we delivered, not just in 2017, but over the past several years, and we will continue working to earn your confidence by meeting and exceeding your expectations of us in 2018 and beyond.  And, I am equally pleased and proud to share that we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Johnson & Johnson credo this year. Our credo dates back to 1943, authored by Robert Wood Johnson II, the son of one of the founding Johnson brothers right before Johnson & Johnson became a public company. At that moment, J&J\u2019s moral compass as a company was formally documented and that has sustained us for the last 75 years. Our credo is part of our DNA. We live into the responsibilities that outlines each and every day which enables us to deliver shareholder value and at the same time, strive to change the trajectory of health for humanity.  So as I travel around the world, meeting with our employees, customers, partners, government officials and world leaders, I am constantly reminded that the astounding pace of change we are experiencing in healthcare, as well as the ongoing technological, cultural, political, and social demands that influence decisions we make in this space. And I truly believe that no company is better positioned to lead profound change during this dynamic era than Johnson & Johnson. I am both humbled and honored to have led this company for the last six years and while I am proud of our history, I know we will do even more to deliver life-enhancing products and services of the highest quality to people around the world in 2018 and beyond. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I will now turn it over to Dominic who will provide additional details about our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2018. Dominic? Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Alex and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve heard from both Joe and Alex, we are very pleased with our 2017 performance. Our full year performance reflects the acceleration of sales growth in the second half of 2017 as we expected, largely driven by the organic growth in the Pharmaceutical segment. In addition, we are very pleased with the performance from all of our acquisitions including Actelion, and Medical Optics, which have been integrated seamlessly and are performing at or above our expectations. We ended the year at the top-end of our most recent guidance with sales at 6% operational growth for the year.  With respect to adjusted earnings, we finished at the top-end of our EPS guidance range with EPS at $7.30 per share. Overall, both sales and EPS exceeded consensus estimates. Turning to the next slide, you can see our consolidated condensed statement of earnings for the full year 2017. Our guidance from October included an expectation that we would maintain to slightly decline our pretax operating margins on an adjusted basis.  In looking at your models, it appears that they\u2019ve reflected that expectation. During the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our investment in research and development, which essentially was offset by a higher level of divestiture gains in other income and lower tax rate as compared to your models as I will discuss in just a few minutes. Therefore, for the full year, you will see pretax operating margin at 25% versus 29.4% the prior year, but this is on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of special items, our pretax operating margin declined 140 basis points on an adjusted basis as compared to the prior year.  Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Our reported sales for the fourth quarter grew 11.5%, 9.4% on an operational basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, our adjusted fourth quarter 2017 operational growth rate was 4.2%, an acceleration from the third quarter. Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4.8 billion in the quarter, up 9.5% compared to 2016, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.74 versus $1.58 a year ago or up 10.1% and exceeded the mean of analyst estimates. Excluding the net impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted diluted EPS was $1.67 or up 5.7% for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we incurred intangible amortization expense of approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis and an after-tax net charge for special items of approximately $14.6 billion. The largest component of special items this quarter reflects $13.6 billion, a provisional amount for recently enacted tax legislation. The U.S. impact is a provisional $13 billion. As you know, Johnson & Johnson has long advocated for the modernization of the business tax code. And overall we are very pleased with the new U.S. tax legislation, particularly, the lower tax rate and the ability to access our cash previously retained overseas, now at a reasonable rate.  The legislation requires a transition tax on previously unremitted foreign earnings even if no longer in the form of cash repaid over an eight year period with a heavier weighting towards the latter years. This amount is provisional as we anticipate further guidance from the SEC and the IRS. The remaining after-tax special items included $500 million for litigation charges, $300 million for in-process research and development, and $200 million for ongoing restructuring charges. Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 540 basis points higher than the same period last year. This is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up charges related to recent acquisitions. Excluding this impact, cost of goods sold was 80 basis points higher than the prior year due to primarily to the mix of products sold. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 29.8% of sales. This is 50 basis points higher than last year as we invested behind the launch of new products. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 18% in the quarter, 340 basis points higher than the prior year, which is mostly related to our collaborative agreements with Idorsia, the R&D spin out of Actelion and Legend Biotech regarding exciting new therapies we are developing. These higher levels of investments late in the year were offset by higher other income and a lower tax rate in the quarter. Interest expense net of interest income was higher than the fourth quarter 2016 reflecting higher levels of debt and lower levels of cash. Other income and expense was a net gain of $9 million in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $20 million in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items in both years.  Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of $848 million, compared to a net gain of $220 million in the prior year period reflecting gains from divestitures at a slightly higher level than our guidance for the year, which we redeployed to R&D and selling and marketing expenses as I said earlier. The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2017 was 9%. The adjusted full year tax rate for 2017 was 17.2%, which was below our guidance in October. This lower effective tax rate for the year was lower than our guidance primarily as a result of the increased investment in R&D which I noted earlier. This was incurred at the then higher U.S. tax rate. It was also lower than guidance due to international earnings mix and lower tax jurisdictions, and higher tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which we saw in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of these previously unplanned items, our normalized annual effective tax rate in 2017 would have been between 19% and 19.5%. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Full year 2017 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise was 31.7% of sales in both 2017 and 2016. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 32.7% is higher than the previous year by 50 basis points, primarily due to the divestiture gains, but partially offset by investments in new product launches. Consumer margins improved by 40 basis points versus 2016, while still making important investments for future growth. We continue to see improvements in our Consumer margins as we\u2019ve previously discussed. Pharmaceutical margins were slightly lower by 30 basis points due to R&D investments that I mentioned previously. Now I\u2019ll provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2018. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give you some guidance on items we know maybe difficult for you to forecast. I would like to first address our cash and debt position. At the end of the quarter, we had $16.2 billion of net debt, which consists of $18.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34.6 billion of debt. We are always looking for the right opportunities to deploy our capital to create greater value for shareholders following our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Although we are continuously evaluating external value-creating opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2018 net interest expense of between $700 million and $800 million reflecting higher levels of new debt incurred in 2017 and lower levels of cash due to the major acquisitions in 2017. This also reflects an offset for repatriated cash, which avoids further debt issuances. Regarding other income and expense which will be account when we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from litigation and investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs, we will be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.7 billion to $2 billion. As is commonly the case, forecasted gains assume various transactions to which we typically don\u2019t comment on for obvious reasons. However, as you know, we actively evaluate and manage our portfolio with the intention of redeploying those gains toward investment opportunities that fund long-term growth. With regard to pretax operating margins and not including the impact of any special items, we expect to improve margins in 2018 by approximately 100 basis points as we continue key margin improving initiatives in our business. We also expect, as a result of the lower tax rate on U.S. earnings, that we will see increased investment in R&D in 2008, which would mitigate any further operating margin improvements. And now a word on taxes. As I noted earlier, we are pleased by the final passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New legislation to modernize the U.S. tax bill for business, which we believe will further jumpstart the economy, fuel jobs and investment and level the playing field between U.S. and foreign headquartered companies. Our guidance today includes the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation, although some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, and maybe clarified by treasury in the near future. The impact of the new tax legislation on our 2018 rate may differ from the company\u2019s current estimate due to among other things guidance that maybe issued clarifying the mechanics of the some of the rules and interpretations and assumptions the company has made in developing this estimated impact. At this time, we will suggest your models reflect an effective tax rate for 2018 excluding special items of approximately 16.5% to 18%. This reflects approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2.5 percentage points positive impact on our normalized tax rate as a result of new U.S. tax legislation.  As always, we look forward to improving upon this rate throughout the year as certain provisions for implementing the legislation become clarified.  Turning now to guidance on sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2018 includes the impact of generics for PROCRIT and TRACLEER as well as REMICADE biosimilars which we still consider to be at risk to the ongoing patent litigation as we\u2019ve previously discussed.  However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. Regarding ZYTIGA, we disagree with the Patent and Trademark Office ruling last week on the IPR which contradicts their earlier decision to grant the patent. We believe the 483 patent is valid and we\u2019ll continue vigorously to defend it. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and it reflects the underlying performance of our business. Of course, we will also provide an estimate for our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2018 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. For the full year of 2018, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 3.5% and 4.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79 billion to $80 billion.  Our operational sales guidance for 2018 on an underlying basis, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to reflect growth of between 2.5% and 3.5% which is an acceleration from 2017. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro rate last week at $1.22, our guidance for sales growth would increase by approximately 200 basis points.  Of course, we will update this estimate as we progress throughout the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect an increase in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $80.5 billion to $81.5 billion.  And now turning to earnings. Considering all the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $7.80 to $8 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operational constant currency growth of approximately 7% to 9.5%.  Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, with the euro at 1.22, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from between $8 and $8.20 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.  So, in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. We expect the operational sales growth to range between 3.5% and 4.5% and our underlying growth excluding acquisition, divestitures, at approximately 2.5% to 3.5% which is an acceleration from 2017.  With regard to expected EPS growth on an operational adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 7% to 9.5%, consistent with our objective to grow earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis. Also for 2018, we expect to improve our pretax operating margins by approximately 100 basis points based on the guidance I just provided, while also increasing our investment in R&D for future growth. While we are pleased with our performance in 2017, we also recognize that there are still areas within our business where we continue to be particularly focused on improving our performance. Additionally, we are very pleased with the passage of the new tax legislation and its positive impact on our ability to access our earnings outside the U.S. and allowing us the ability to increase our investment in innovation, a substantial portion of which we intend to deploy in the United States.  As we execute on our growth platforms and near-term priorities that Alex shared with you this morning, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation which will ensure our future growth and success. Finally, before I turn it over to Joe for the Q&A portion, just a reminder to please save the day for our Consumer and Medical Device Business Review on May 16th. Thank you, and Joe, now back to you. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Alex and Dominic. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple questions for me. Dominic, just thinking about revenue guidance, first for 2018, can you just give us a general sense of the pieces, based on your qualitative commentary, my sense is, Consumer is relatively flattish for 2017, Devices gets a little better and the Pharmaceutical business is something around the 6% range.  So clear acceleration. I just want to understand sort of those mixed pieces and then within pharma, the can we expect that REMICADE and ZYTIGA, can you just give us expectations around those businesses for pharma and I have a quick one for Alex. Dominic Caruso : Sure, David. Well, as you know, we don\u2019t provide specific segment sales guidance. But I think it\u2019s fair to point out that we saw acceleration in the back half of 2018 across mostly the entire business and we expect that that will continue through 2018 and we have lots of new product launches, as you know and new product approvals in the pharma business which should help accelerate growth.  With regards to REMICADE and ZYTIGA, again, we don\u2019t give specific guidance on individual products either, but with REMICADE as you know, we saw far less of an impact in 2017 than we had expected. The product is now been on the market for over a year and we do have an additional biosimilar market entrant.  So we would expect that the acceleration of that biosimilar impact to REMICADE, we will see more of that in 2018 than we saw in 2017. But I can\u2019t give you a very specific number. And with respect to ZYTIGA, as I said in my opening comments about sales guidance, we do not expect to see generic competition for ZYTIGA in 2018. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. And then, just a quick strategic question for you. I know, it\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9 everyone expected increased M&A activity in life science post tax reforming yet and sort what we are seeing here in the last few days, how does tax reform kind of impacts your views from a corporate perspective on both the size and activity of M&A and the level of reinvestments back into the U.S. or broader reinvestments versus the money you would give back to shareholders? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, David. Look, overall, what I would say is that, our strategy around M&A will likely stay quite consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about before and it really starts with unmet medical need. Where do we see there to be significant opportunities to improve care for patients.  What do we see is being value creating and what do we see is being something that we can execute with a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. Regarding tax reform, what we said from the very beginning is that one of the major reasons in addition to lowering the rate is just frankly the flexibility that it provides us and we think it actually helps make us more competitive, particularly on an international level if we happen to be in a competitive situation with other companies, because now we have greater flexibility on how we can access that cash.  So, we think, net-net, it\u2019s a positive for us. As you heard Dominic mention earlier, regarding the more immediate tax reform impact, we think that the wise thing to do is to invest a good portion of that back into R&D.  If you look over the past several years, the output, the productivity, particularly in our Pharmaceutical pipeline, but also in others of our investments in R&D, we think have been at the high-end and we think ultimately doing that, it will have the greatest impact on our business, will help us to get out to better serve underserved needs around the globe and that\u2019s where we are heading in that direction. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, David. Next question Rob? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, on ZYTIGA, your assumptions for 2018 were clear, but I guess, Dominic, my question for you is, if we do see generic ZYTIGA earlier in the year or in 2018, what\u2019s your ability to offset that on the EPS line? And I have one follow-up question for Alex. Dominic Caruso : Well, as you know, Larry, we provide a range of guidance for both sales and earnings and obviously we\u2019ll have to see what happens with ZYTIGA in the ultimate upcoming district court case and others. But we are pretty confident that the range we provided could absorb any impact from ZYTIGA. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s helpful. And then, Alex, 2017 seemed like a kind of a watershed year for robotics in the Medical Device space and they are starting to have some impact on your businesses in the orthopedic area and in the surgical area. So, how are you addressing this and how quickly can you launch your surgical robot in the U.S. and are you satisfied with that timeline given what we are seeing here? Thanks for taking the questions. Alex Gorsky : Larry, as you know, several years ago, we entered into the agreement with Google and Verb and Verily in really creating our significant approach in robotics. What I would say is that, we are excited about that opportunity. In fact, just a few weeks ago, when we were out for the - there for the conference, I got a chance to visit, see the prototype.  I would say overall that it\u2019s on track and we are continuing to make refinements in it, but clearly, we think the area of robotics is going to have an impact on surgery and that\u2019s why we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a system that is different from those that\u2019s currently offered that we think takes it beyond simply assisting in the surgery to actually helping to improve the outcome of the surgery.  Something that\u2019s more modular, something that\u2019s frankly is more economical and that\u2019s our goal. So overall, the project remains on track with our timelines and we are excited about it. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Larry. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Mike Weinstein : Yes, good morning guys. I am going to try and follow-up with a couple items on the 2018 guidance. So, the top-line 2.5% to 3.5% organic would be a little below what you reported this quarter and it\u2019s one Dominic could you just spend a minute to shed a little light on the differential of how you see the 2018 top-line outlook versus what you saw this quarter and as well related to the second half of 2017?  Second, the other income guidance of $1.7 billion to $2 billion of gains, that seems to imply an asset sale beyond what you\u2019ve already disclosed to the street recognizing that the business that you comment on, that you haven\u2019t executed on yet, is the residual diabetes business. So, is there something that you haven\u2019t yet disclosed to the street that\u2019s contemplated in that guidance? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Yes, let me take the second question first, Mike. We \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, we are always constantly looking at our business and making the determination whether the business is sometimes better in someone else\u2019s hands or we can get better value for our shareholders through a divestiture. So, we have considered other assets in that regard. We haven\u2019t disclosed what those assets are for obvious reasons.  And we\u2019ll obviously continue to update our estimates as we move forward with those potential transactions. A very important point to point out though is that it\u2019s also true that whatever gains we experience we will look to obviously redeploy them back in the business which has been our history now for several years and we think that\u2019s the right way to approach these things. With respect to the operational guidance, excluding acquisitions and divestitures on a organic basis, we did about 2.4% for 2017 and I mentioned 2.5% to 3.5% for all of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2017 was higher than that as you pointed out and I think this just has to do with the ramp of products, particularly in the pharmaceutical business which are continuing to grow, but they are obviously continuing to grow now off of a higher base. So we took that into consideration in our estimate. Mike Weinstein : Okay, and just one follow-up here Dominic, the opportunity to have with tax reforms to \u2013 there is tow pieces to it, but you have immediately access to your previously trapped $16 billion in OUS cash. Are you assuming that you are going to use a portion of that cash to immediately pay down U.S. debt? And Dominic, now that you have access to your global cash flows going forward, are you thinking any differently about ongoing buybacks or your dividend relative to how you were prior? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Well, Mike, one thing to point out is that, right, we have $16 billion of cash. Not all of it is readily repatriated back to the U.S. but not because of the U.S. tax code, but because of individual country-by-country restrictions. So, I would say that what we\u2019ve already estimated is that, roughly in the neighborhood of $12 billion of that will come back immediately.  We\u2019ll immediately use that to fund U.S. operations. But as you have pointed out before a year reports, in the U.S. we have a shortfall of cash needs versus cash generation and that\u2019s why we were borrowing in the past. So we\u2019ll no longer need to borrow for U.S. purposes and then the balance of that we\u2019ll immediately pay down debt.  As far as any change to our capital allocation strategy, as a result of having more readily access to the cash, as Alex pointed out, I think our strategy remains the same. We have a very disciplined approach to this.  It starts with investing in our business which we intend to increment, as I mentioned earlier and as Alex mentioned and then obviously the dividend after that remains our top priority and we think we\u2019re already in a very healthy dividend at 50% of our cash flow being paid out to shareholders. So, we\u2019ll evaluate our opportunities on a case-by-case basis and make the best decision that we think promotes the long-term growth and benefit for our shareholders. Joseph Wolk : Just one point of clarification, so it\u2019s clear, we would pay down maturing debt this year, right. We looked at potentially other options, but there is a penalty associated with longer-term debt. Thanks for the question Mike. Next question please Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we shift a little bit over to Medical Devices? Specifically, two questions, one big picture. You talked about 2017 being a transition year. How can we think about 2018? And then my second question really has to do with the orthopedic business. What\u2019s really going on in the spine business and in your knee franchise? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Joanne, thank you very much for the questions. Why don\u2019t I take both of those? Look, I think, big picture what we see going on in our Medical Device business is, 2017 was a year of transition and what we are pleased about is the fact that we saw an increase in the number of launches. In fact, I think we ended up having 16 launches, most of them in the back-end of the year.  We saw improved execution. Given some of the reorganizations that had occurred earlier, and frankly we think that\u2019s also what produced some of the improvement in results sequentially and if you look at fourth quarter or particularly in the hospital medical device division you saw performance of about 3.4%. Now, I think what\u2019s also important to highlight is, this is a business where we\u2019ve got businesses such as EP, which is growing at about 19%.  We saw endo, mac growing at a very healthy rate as well around 14%. We saw areas such as energy and biosurgery growing at about 8% and of course we saw our Vision Care business growing at the core at about 6% with the contact lens, about 5% with the surgery business. So overall those businesses are actually performing quite well.  Of course, offsetting that has been the performance of our diabetes business and some of our specialty surgery areas as Joe outlined earlier. So, overall, we remain very confident in these businesses, but clearly we\u2019ve taken a lot of action regarding innovation, taken a lot of action regarding pruning the portfolio and we\u2019ve taken some action as well to improve execution in the field.  So we think overall it will result in an accelerated growth rate in 2018. If we dig down a little bit deeper regarding orthopedics what we would say is, the spine as we\u2019ve had a delay in some of the product launches that we had in this area. If you recall back over the last several years this was the area likely most impacted by the integration along with Synthes that resulted in the most disruption.  We\u2019ve seen an overall slowdown in this marketplace due to reimbursement issues. So, clearly, we are focused on continuing to launch new innovation and work our way through some of the disruption that we saw earlier. We do have product launches planned for the back-end of this year including an interspace cage as well as some additional plates and screws, as well as visioning devices that we think will improve performance.  So, again, we think there remains a lot of unmet medical need there in an area where we can clearly improve our performance. Regarding knees, we are in the midst now of launching the ATTUNE revision, which we think will be an important addition to the ATTUNE platform and we expect that will result in increased uptake in 2018. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Joanne. Rob, next question please? Operator : Yes, your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Q - Jeff Holford : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So, I know there was a bit of confusions on the Q4 EBT margins that came in. I wanted maybe Dominic you can just speak to that very quickly in terms of can we expect a more normal pattern of spend in 2018 in terms of how the margins will play out in 2018? I know you\u2019ve guided to the 100 basis points pretax increase that\u2019s helpful. But you are speaking to higher R&D. So how can we think about COGS and SG&A on more of an adjusted basis? And then I have a quick follow-up would just be, were there any one-offs that either ZYTIGA or IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA seem to seem to have been light, obviously ZYTIGA was very impressive in the quarter. Thank you. Dominic Caruso : Yes, sure, Jeff. Well, couple things. We had announced several years ago that we were embarking on a number of cost saving efficiency initiatives which we refer to as our enterprise standards and productivity and that particular program actually culminates or reaches its peak in 2018. So we are going to see much better cost - year-over-year improvement as a result of that program in 2018 versus 2017 or 2017 versus 2016.  You remember that our Medical Device restructuring program was also going to achieve its peak savings by 2018. So they are positive developments in the 2018 margin. We will in fact increase our investment in R&D as both Alex and I mentioned, that\u2019s a bit of a headwind on overall margin improvement, but we feel confident that at about a 100 basis point improvement which we\u2019ll see that throughout 2018.  As far as how it meters by quarter, that all depends because we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier \u2013 to an earlier question, we tend to redeploy the investee gains from various divestitures back into the business and make incremental investments quarterly. So, that sometimes they may not be ratably distributed throughout the whole year. And Joe, do you have a comment on the ZYTIGA question? Joseph Wolk : Sure. For ZYTIGA and IMBRUVICA, so with ZYTIGA, nothing unique in those results, Jeff. It\u2019s really being driven by the LATITUDE data where we are seeing an increase not only in the market growth but then, obviously as I mentioned earlier, almost 5 points a share for ZYTIGA in terms of comparisons to the prior year.  With respect to IMBRUVICA, that\u2019s a good observation on your part. So we\u2019ve been growing roughly 50% to 55% in the first three quarters. This quarter it was about 38%. But that\u2019s all attributable to increased investment with us and our partner. Feeling good about the recent indications that we received and putting investment behind those. So if you normalize for that, you\u2019d be up around 51%. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Next question, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good afternoon or good morning guys. Alex, a question for you. There has been a major debate on whether Amazon will start distributing drugs and/or distribute devices and supplies. Is this having any impact on how you guys are starting to think about how you distribute drugs and devices? I am just curious of your thoughts because we are getting a lot of questions from investors on these topics. Thanks. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Glenn, thank you for the question. And look, we are always considering what could be the impact of new entrants, new competitors or disruptions in any of our channels. To be clear, we are already a partner with Amazon, particularly in our Consumer segment where we sell directly through Amazon, as well as through the ecommerce channels with some of our major retailers that we work with as well as our own. We are watching closely in areas such as the Medical Device space and the Pharmaceutical space and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. I think, ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on their ability to meet all the regulatory requirements to make sure that customers are getting good transparency around pricing and service levels and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. Joseph Wolk : Great. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Just have a few \u2013 first one across the immunology category. IMS has pointed a pretty good growth and Derm for the aggregate J&J portfolio, but it looks GI have had a couple of tough quarters. Is this more of a mix issue and what is the path of gaining share back?  And the second question for Alex, big picture, when you look at the Pharma segment, oncology has been consistently the fastest growing franchise, but when you think about organic R&D or external biz dev, is there a focus on shoring up underperforming therapeutic areas or do you guys look more holistically at investments in Pharma? Thanks. Joseph Wolk : So, Jeff, let me maybe address the first question with respect to immunology and our performance there. If you look at it, we are very pleased with the uptake for Crohn\u2019s and STELARA. You compare to the fourth quarter of last year, we are up about 11 points. Now some of that has come at the expense of REMICADE but only about five points of that. So, overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the GI space for immunology. Alex Gorsky : Jeff, regarding the second one, look we are always looking for opportunities across all of our therapeutic areas, the six in Pharma but also all of our other major platforms in both Medical Devices as well as Consumer. For example, in 2017, we completed about 16 acquisitions. I think we did almost 60 different innovation deals and about over 20 investments from JJDC and again, that represents a very diverse cross section across all of our areas.  And clearly, when we see a gap in our portfolio that\u2019s not meeting customer needs, a good example of that is over the past several years in trauma with the extremity area or where we see new technology such as stroke that allows us to address an area where there is a lot of unmet medical need and a great new approach. So, yes, we are constantly looking across all those different platforms. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. I have a few. First, for you Dominic and Alex, now with tax reform finally approved and part of law, should we expect that your capital allocation activities or strategy will accelerate this year? You obviously have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. So, does this mean that we should expect activity from you guys to pick up?  And along those lines, I am just curious your thoughts on some of the recent deals that have been announced, two major trades in the biotech area. It seems to be a disconnect between corporate acquirers views on value versus investors. And Alex, just want to get your sense on that. I think it was you or Dominic who said at a conference back in September that companies are going to wait for tax reform to do deals, but then, deals that was going to end up having to chase deals at much higher prices.  So, I am just wondering what your views are on that. And then, secondly on ZYTIGA, I know you are going to defend that vigorously. But, Dominic, can you walk through the steps when would be the earliest that generics could enter the market? And then, lastly, Dominic, normally you provide a preliminary number for free cash flow in your year-end slides. I didn\u2019t see at this time. Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : Okay. Hi, Jami, good morning. So, just a couple thoughts on capital allocation and recent deals and Alex will comment on that as well. So with respect to capital allocation, both Alex and I have described this approach very consistently for years and we do have a certain capital allocation priority that we go through with dividends at the top after we\u2019ve appropriately invested in our business and value-creating M&A is the second priority.  Now, value-creating M&A depends on what value you paid for the asset and whether you are going to generate cash flows in excess of that value which includes a premium and if that deal is not value-creating for our shareholders, we are not interested in pursuing it. Even though you\u2019ve seen more activity in the early part of this year, I just want to remind you that we were extremely active last year doing in excess of $35 billion of acquisitions last year. Obviously in advance of corporate tax reform. With respect to ZYTIGA, one way to think about this is that, the current 30 months stay under the Hatch-Waxman Law expires in October of 2018 and the recent IPR ruling against the ZYTIGA patent does not in any way impact that 30 month stay, meaning that the 30 month stay is not lifted. It\u2019s still in existence.  Of course, during that time period, we will go into district court and have hearings on the patent and should we succeed with those hearings then, of course the 30 month stay wouldn\u2019t have any difference, because the patent extends beyond this year or into 2027.  Also with respect to free cash flow, Jami, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Alex for any other comments on recent deals, we don\u2019t typically provide a free cash flow estimate in our guidance.  Although I can tell you that we had very strong free cash flow in 2017 at $17.8 billion, and typically our free cash flow growth approximates our earnings growth because our businesses do a great job of managing their receivables, payables and capital deployment. So, a good rule of thumb is, free cash flow generally grows at the same rate as our earnings growth. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Hey, Jami. Thank you very much for the question. Look, I would pick up where Dominic left off which you look over the past year, we did make over $35 billion worth of investment ahead of this which we felt was the right thing to do. We do that really based upon unmet medical need, either franchise or as a technology complementary to something that we have \u2013 that we are already doing or is it an area where we feel that, our R&D clinical regulatory development skills or commercial reimbursement skills frankly can make a difference and ultimately is this value creating. We said quite consistently over the past few years and I think we\u2019ve acted in a way that we would prefer earlier stage investments and we think across all of our different categories, we demonstrated that whether it\u2019s the next ZYTIGA or IMBRUVICA or the next NEUTROGENA or the next Biosense Webster when we can get a great new technology or innovation or science that we can then ramp up through clinical development or regulatory skills and then launch and create billion dollar platforms and major breakthroughs for patients, that\u2019s our preferred model.  And look, we \u2013 at the same time, we do watch competitiveness and what\u2019s going on in different categories which we\u2019ll continue to do this year. But we feel confident in the strength of our pipeline as we talked about. Again, whether it\u2019s in Pharma, with the very high number of line extensions or products we expect to launch over the next several years or our Medical Device space or in Consumer.  We think we\u2019ve got a nice balanced approach between internal and external R&D at about 50% each of them gets in. Ultimately, we\u2019ve also got the flexibility to move depending on what opportunities present themselves, because frankly of the way that we\u2019ve been able to manage our balance sheet, because of our overall strong position, should an opportunity present itself, we can \u2013 we always have the purgative to engage at that point in time. So, thanks a lot and I expect that\u2019s the way we will navigate our way through 2018 and beyond. Joseph Wolk : Next question please, Rob? Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thanks and good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. One on Consumer and one on Devices. I\u2019ll just lay them out there to make it easy. So, first on Consumer, just a pretty straightforward question, some of the issues impacting that business in 2017 were market-related.  So I guess my question is, will those market issues be cleared up in 2018 and could be the combination of better market growth and changes in Baby Care and other initiatives already get back to historical growth rates for Consumer in 2018.  That\u2019s my Consumer question. The Device question I wanted to ask is that, 2017 is a year where there is a bunch of strategic moves made both in terms of divestitures and M&A and Alex you were starting 2018 you are once again emphasizing portfolio management in Devices as a core strategy.  And I am just curious, is that emphasis on portfolio management, are you referencing there the decision you\u2019ll make this year on diabetes or is there the potential for other kind of portfolio management moves in Devices in 2018? Thank you very much. Alex Gorsky : Yes, thank you, Bob. Let me start. I would say, yes, we do expect our Consumer business to grow at a faster rate in 2018 than we saw in 2017 and you are correct in that we think some of the market forces, i.e. the shift to ecommerce, shift in some cases to more natural brands, digital types of brands have been more secular in nature and affected all of the large FMCG companies.  That being said, we are not just sitting back. We are making aggressive moves in areas such as ecommerce investments in that shift. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we are taking the innovation model of a company like Vogue which has continued to do very well as part of Johnson & Johnson and we are trying to export that to other areas in our Consumer innovation to be faster, more agile, even more flexible.  And so, we think that combination combined within some cases just improved execution, particularly in areas like our Baby line that\u2019s going to be going through a major relaunch through the course of 2018 is going to result in improved performance. And by the way, we still have some core areas such as NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, LISTERINE, OTC that we remain very confident in. These are great brands with great science behind them that have also got great consumer loyalty as well as attention.  Now if I switch now to Devices, I believe we\u2019ve been pretty consistent saying that portfolio management can and should be and has been an integral part of our strategy and so for 2018, yes, part of that, we\u2019ve mentioned that we are actively looking at strategic options for diabetes.  But there are also other areas where they have not met our criterion in terms of us feeling as though we\u2019ve got the right competitive position, the right technology going forward or it\u2019s not complementary to one of our existing platforms that it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad business or a bad technology, but perhaps it\u2019s better in such a way that in someone else\u2019s hands that we would continue that in 2018 as well. Dominic Caruso : And Bob, one thing to hopefully not to read into too much, because we have the question in light of the perspective of Devices. When we did this portfolio management, it\u2019s across all three of our major businesses and so, we have plans in 2018 for all three of the businesses where assets are being evaluated and we may make decisions with respect to those assets. So it\u2019s not limited to Devices. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Bob. Next question please, Rob? Operator : Next question is from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, one just on REMICADE in the U.S. I think you mentioned most of the impacts just on the price side as opposed to volume. But could you just give us a sense exactly how much of the sort of overall market volume is still with the brand and how much is going to either the biosimilars?  And second, maybe just a pipeline one that haven't really talked much about on Esketamine. I think that\u2019s an important data point for you guys. So can you just give us a sense of when we should expect that data? And then, obviously there is some unusual features that product in terms of the administration of safety it maybe a scheduled product. What do you think, just maybe frame your expectations on what would be sort of considered good data as we await the results? Joseph Wolk : Okay, so, Vamil, with respect to REMICADE in the U.S. specifically, I would say that the volume is still up around the high 90%. So, all of the change that you saw in the quarter of about 9% down was associated with price declines. With respect to data for Esketamine, so there is a couple of different presentations. There is, as you know, four five trials with respect to that program. I would say, the first long-term safety data to be released is likely going to be the 3002 study. That\u2019s also considered important for short-term efficacy as well as the safety. We would expect that possibly at several events in the second quarter of this year. Thanks for the question. Next question please, Rob and I think this is probably going to be our last one. Operator : Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Just a quick question following up on ZYTIGA, Dominic totally understand you aren\u2019t assuming any generic competition, appreciate your answer that you think that you can offset that, but I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there, where you think you are being \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say overly conservative, but more conservative where you could see upside to potentially offset some of \u2013 some headwinds that maybe aren\u2019t being considered in the guidance? Dominic Caruso : Yes, thanks, Danielle. Well, what I said to the answer the question earlier was that, obviously we have to wait and see what happens with the district court decision which happens later this quarter. But in the end, should ZYTIGA generics come to market, which of course, we are not expecting we intend to defend the patent vigorously. I said that our range of sales and earnings guidance should be sufficiently wide to absorb that impact. I think we are going to look at upside in all of our businesses going forward. But I think the range we\u2019ve provided should be sufficient to offset any impact of a negative ZYTIGA decision. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for the questions posed today and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those who we couldn\u2019t get to due to time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as needed.  I will now turn the call back to Alex for some closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : Okay, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We are proud to share our results for 2017, our strong results and we\u2019ve been more excited about the lining up with you and discussing the prospects for 2018 which we are very excited about as well. So, thanks for your continued belief and support and commitment to Johnson & Johnson. We look forward to updating you as we move our way through the year, in particular at the May meeting we will be reviewing our Medical Device and Consumer businesses. And, again, thank you very much and we\u2019ll look forward to continued updates over the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello. This is Joe Walk, Vice President of Investor relations and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the investor conference call reviewing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the first quarter of 2018. Accompanying me on today\u2019s call are Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will provide commentary on the quarter\u2019s financial performance and Joaquin Duato, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Company Group Chairman of Pharmaceuticals who will participate in the Q&A portion. Thank you for joining us and your interest in Johnson & Johnson. Our strong first quarter results are an extension of the momentum we established in the second half of 2017. Pharmaceuticals again grew well above the market. Consumers growth maintained its acceleration and medical device has platforms that are enhancing market leading positions as well as areas where we are executing plans to improve performance that are not meeting our objectives as mentioned during our call in January. We continue to exceed financial expectations while managing the business for the long term to benefit patients, customers and shareholders. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today's discussion as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 60 minutes. Now, on to our results. Worldwide sales were $20 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a 12.6% increase versus the first quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 8.4%, as currency had a positive impact of 4.2%. In the U.S., sales were up 6.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 10.9%, with the effect of currency exchange rates benefitting our reported OUS results by 9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 4.3% worldwide, increasing 1.3% in the U.S. and 7.6% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment. With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.60 versus $1.61 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.06 representing increases of 11.8% and 12.6% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.5%. Dominic will provide further earnings details in his remarks. Beginning with consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items that build upon the slides that will be presented unless otherwise stated, percentages reference represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2017 or in other words results that exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide consumer segment sales totaled $3.4 billion growing operationally 1.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the COMPEED business in wound care other franchise outside the U.S. total adjusted operational sales growth was 2% worldwide. The Beauty franchise led segment performance growing 7.1% operationally. Growth in the quarter was aided by a seasonal inventory build of approximately $20 million related to sun protection products. In the U.S. we are seeing robust growth in the e-commerce channel for the NEUTROGENA and AVEENO brands. Results outside the U.S. were driven by the Asia Pacific region where Dr. Ci Labo and NEUTROGENA brands had strong uptake. Worldwide and U.S. market shares remained relatively flat compared to the same period of 2017 and the worldwide beauty market is estimated to have grown approximately 4%. OTC grew 0.9% but that understates the true performance of the franchise. In the U.S. strong consumption in both adult and children\u2019s TYLENOL and children\u2019s MOTRIN was offset by a negative comparison to the first quarter of 2017 when pipeline was built for the launch of the rapid release and chewable children\u2019s TYLENOL negatively impacting worldwide OTC operational growth in the first quarter of 2018 by an estimated three points. Oral care results reflect a market leading but relatively flat share in a market growing modestly at 1%. The divestitures of the REACH and REMBRANDT brands negatively impacted worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points. As previously referenced, Baby Care results are not what we want them to be and we have the franchise restage planned for later this year. Our business review day on May 16 highlighting both the consumer and medical device businesses will share more details about Johnson\u2019s baby restage. Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $9.8 billion grew 15.1%, excluding the net impact of the Actelion acquisition, operational, adjusted sales growth was 7.5% worldwide. The segment was led by the oncology portfolio which grew globally 37%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing globally better than 60%. In the U.S. market growth and the strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S. DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration in the 29 EMEA countries it is now commercially available in and growth in the Asia-Pacific region was driven by the products recent approval in Japan last November. IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained approximately three points of market share versus prior year across all lines of therapy, based on the fourth-quarter data largely driven by share in line 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL. The CLL market is estimated to have grown almost 15%. ZYTIGA had another strong quarter growing 54%. In February, the FDA approved ZYTIGA for patients with metastatic high risk castration sensitive prostate cancer based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. This was a driver for ZYTIGA\u2019s first quarter performance resulting in market and share expansion. During the quarter, we expanded our presence in the treatment of prostate cancer with the U.S. approval of ERLEADA, a Next-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor to treat pre-metastatic patients. We also filed for EU approval in February. In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 12%. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn\u2019s disease as more than 20,000 Crohn\u2019s patients have been treated with the STELARA since that indication launched late in 2016. Market share has improved 11 points in Crohn\u2019s disease compared to the first quarter of 2017. REMICADE in the U.S. was down 22%, negatively impacted by a prior period pricing adjustment related to a major payers delayed submission of rebate claims. We don\u2019t anticipate significant adjustments will be required in future quarters. Excluding this adjustment, REMICADE\u2019s decline would have been close to the 16%, largely driven by price erosion as REMICADE has retained better than 95% of its volume share. Lastly, in immunology sales for our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA totaled $72 million. New-to-brand share including first dose sampling program volume is outpacing the leading competitors. In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio grew steadily in all regions with increasing market share, particularly in Europe. CONCERTA in the U.S. is experiencing negative price due to generic competition. Results for the Actelion pulmonary hypertension assets acquired in mid-2017 are [Indiscernible] to hear on a pro forma basis. OPSUMIT grew globally 7% which was comprised of 4% in the U.S. and 11% outside the U.S. UPTRAVI continues to experience strong demand with 37% growth in the U.S. As expected, TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year. The dynamic we noted in the fourth quarter results impacting all three brands was an increased level of patients on assistance programs in the U.S. although that was less of a negative factor as the quarter progressed. I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical device sales were $6.8 billion growing 3.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.1% worldwide. Beginning this quarter within the medical device segment, we are reporting revenue for the neurovascular platform in combination with the cardiovascular platform under the label of interventional solutions. This change better reflects our business structure given the recent divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery and the creation of the CERENOVUS neurovascular business unit which includes the Codman neurovascular business as well as the recent acquisitions of Neuravi and Pulsar Vascular. Both the Codman Neurosurgery and CERENOVUS revenues were previously reported within the orthopedics platform under the spine and other category. Please reference the supplemental sale schedule on our website for additional details. Within Interventional solutions, Electrophysiology grew approximately 15% worldwide as the Atrial fibrillation procedure market continues to grow and we improve upon our market leadership in the space with newer product offerings in ablation and advance catheters. In Orthopedics, although selling days did negatively impact growth by approximately one point, we are disappointed with the performance and are actively implementing plans to address challenges we face in this segment. In trauma, we are experiencing good volume for some of our newer products like the TFNA femoral nail and in hips, we continue to see strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS anterior approach. However, we are losing share in spine as newer competitive entries are being better received in the market as well as in these where we believe new offerings throughout 2018 such as the ATTUNE revision system, ATTUNE S+ and Cementless are expected to improve performance. We were pleased to announce during the first quarter the acquisition of Orthotaxy, which we believe will provide next-generation robotic assisted orthopedic surgery which will be on display at our May 16 analyst day. Pricing pressure impacted all categories in orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative 4% in spine, negative 3% in hips, and negative 2% in both trauma and knees. Within the surgery group, the advanced surgery category was strong, particularly outside the U.S. On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 7% as new products are experiencing strong demand and bio surgery grew 5% driven by Topical Absorbable Hemostat & Bioseal. Growth & Energy was just shy of 3% as strength outside the U.S. was partially offset by the U.S. market dynamics of a shift to advanced bipolar products and reprocessed products. As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we saw a slight increase in hospital admissions of about 1.5%. Surgical procedures were down approximately 50 basis points and lab procedures were up about 3%. Our preliminary estimates for the first quarter indicate modest declines across all those rates with admissions growth at 1%, surgical procedures down approximately 1%, and lab procedures up an estimated 2%. To conclude, the medical device segment vision care. As a reminder, the acquisition of the vision surgical business closed February 27, 2017. Excluding the one month of sales in 2017 for that acquisition and other smaller acquisitions, the vision care business grew approximately 9%. The contact lens business grew a very healthy 11% worldwide on the strength of ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE moist lines, but also benefit in the quarter from one of our larger customers scaling up a new distribution center. This was worth about three points. In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 5% on a pro forma basis was driven by intraocular lenses in cataracts. That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 first-quarter. For your reference, here is the slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the first quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso, who will provide his insights on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s quarterly results for the 46th consecutive time. As most of you on the call know, on March 20, Dominic announced plans for his retirement later this year. While Dominic will still be at investor events in the coming months and opportunities for more proper send-offs will occur, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge on this call his many contributions to Johnson & Johnson and its employees, the healthcare industry and quite frankly industry in its broadest sense. I have personally learned a great deal from Dominic and benefited from his leadership, a sentiment that I know many folk share. Dominic on behalf of everyone that has had the privilege to know and work with you at Johnson & Johnson, thank you for your years of effort and dedication and the wisdom you were gracious enough to share. Dominic Caruso : Thanks, Joe and good morning everyone. Well we carried last year\u2019s momentum into 2018 and were off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, with underlying operational sales growth consistent with quarter four of 2017. Both our sales and earnings were above analyst estimates and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term product priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers which we discussed during our call with you in January, and we remain confident in the strength of our business. In our pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2017 continued into the first quarter with underlying operational growth at 7.5%. First-quarter underlying operational sales growth for consumer increased 2%, which is an acceleration over the fourth quarter of 2017. As with pharmaceutical and consumer, in medical devices, we are also above consensus. We continue to have areas of strength behind new products and our vision business continued growth within electrophysiology as well as our advanced surgery business particularly with the endocutters and bio surgery platforms and in our trauma business. We remain focused on making improvements across our medical device businesses and we will discuss this in greater detail on May 16 at our consumer and medical device business review day. Additionally, as part of our ongoing portfolio management, we announced a binding offer for Platinum Equity, a private investment firm to acquire our LifeScan business for approximately $2.1 billion subject to customary closing adjustments. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, we announced that we plan to implement a series of actions across our global supply chain that are intended to focus our resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply our product portfolio. This will enable us to better meet patient and customer needs, make us more agile in a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape and drive business growth. We expect our supply chain actions will include expanding our use of strategic collaborations and bolstering our initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize our network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, we expect these actions to generate approximately $600 million to $800 million in annual pretax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. Further, we expect to record pretax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 million to $2.3 billion over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity which we will treat us special items. And as we discussed in January, the new U.S. tax legislation creates greater flexibility and opportunity to capitalize on our investments in innovation and R&D. Infact, we intend to invest more than $30 billion in the U.S. with capital investments in R&D between 2018 and 2021 representing an increase over the prior four years of more than 15%. Since Joe walked you through the sale results for each segment, I would like to add some overall commentary on those results, our operating performance and what we expect for the balance of the year. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2018. As we have mentioned our operational sales growth this quarter was 8.4% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was 4.3%. If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our adjusted earnings to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of $1.3 billion on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following; intangible asset amortization expense of approximately $1 billion, a charge for the continuing restructuring of our hospital medical device businesses of approximately 100 million, Actelion acquisition related cost of approximately $100 million and a refinement of tax legislation and other cost of approximately $100 million. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $2.06 exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.93 up 5.5% over the prior year. Now let\u2019s take a moment to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold excluding the impact of intangible amortization and acquisition related cost actually decreased by 140 basis points, primarily due to favorable product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.3% of sales were 50 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower cost relative to sales growth in the pharmaceutical business partially offset by investments in recent acquisitions and new product launches in the medical device business. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12% which was a 16% increase versus the prior year as we continue to advance our promising product pipelines. Interest expense net of interest income was higher than last year due to higher average debt levels and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents. Other income and expense was a net expense of $60 million in the quarter, compared to a net gain of $219 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items recorded in this line, current year was a net gain of approximately $77 million compared to a net gain of $320 million in the same period last year. The prior year had higher level of gains from our investment portfolio. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.8% compared to 17.5% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The 17.8 rate for the first quarter is a result of current interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to foreign tax credits and expense allocations. We expect the treasury to issue updated guidance later this year. This expected update is reflected in our guidance which I will provide later. Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise was relatively flat versus the first quarter of 2017, driven by higher levels of operating profit offset by lower levels of other income and expense. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, medical devices at 29.3% is lower than the previous year primarily due to investments in recent acquisitions and new product launches. Pharmaceutical margins improved from the prior year by 150 basis points to 46.5% primarily driven by favorable product mix and cost of products sold, and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Consumer margins declined by 220 basis points to 18% due to an increase in brand marketing expenses supporting the launch of new products. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2018. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net debt which consist of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $600 million and $700 million. This is slightly lower than previous guidance due to changes in average debt levels and changes in rates. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation or investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance due to the anticipated timing of the activities recorded in this account. This lower level of earnings contribution from these activities will be fully offset by the stronger performance in our business as reflected in our first quarter results. Infact, we now expect pretax operating margin improvement of approximately 150 basis points as compared to 100 basis points in our previous guidance. And now for a word on taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximate 16.5% to 18% and that\u2019s no change from our prior guidance. Now turning to sales and earnings; our sales guidance for 2018 includes the impact of generics for PROCRIT and TRACLEER as well as REMICADE biosimilars. However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we\u2019ve done for several years our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. So for the full year of 2018, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of 4% to 5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79.5 billion to $80.3 billion. This is higher than our January guidance based on strong Q1 performance. We now expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures will be between 3% and 4% for the year which is also higher than our previous estimate. And although we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as an example which last week was at a $1.23, the positive impact of foreign currency translation would still be approximately 2%. Thus under this scenario we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 6% to 7% or total expected level reported sales of approximately $81 billion to $81.8 billion which is higher than our previous guidance. And now, turning to earnings; considering all the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.80 to $8 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 6.8% to 9.6% which is consistent with our previous guidance. And again we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements, but just to give you an idea of the potential impact on the EPS with the euro at a $1.23, a reported EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from between $8 and $8.20 per share reflecting growth of approximately 11% at the midpoint of that range and this is consistent with our previous guidance. While it still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. We expect our operational sales growth to range between 4% and 5% and our underlying growth excluding the impact of acquisitions [ph] and divestitures to be approximately 3% to 4% which is an acceleration from 2017. With regard to expected EPS growth on an operational adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 6.8% to 9.6% consistent with our objective of growing earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis. While we expect the lower level of other income as I noted earlier, we now expect to improve our pretax operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Now, before I turn things back to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call, I\u2019d like to make a few brief comments regarding my retirement and the great news that Joe will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Johnson & Johnson on July 1. Joe has been with Johnson & Johnson for the past 19 years and has served on my finance leadership team, reporting to me and we worked together for many, many years. Joe is a strong, collaborative credo-based leader who has a long track record of success most recently in his current role, and as you know him the Head of our Investor Relations Group. I'm confident that Johnson & Johnson will be in great hands and we can expect significant contributions under Joe's financial leadership. Now regarding my retirement, let me start by saying that having been a CFO for almost 12 years and part of Johnson & Johnson for a total of 19 years I have tremendous pride, respect and appreciation for my Johnson & Johnson colleagues, the healthcare industry, our patients and consumers, partners, financial community, media and all the entities that I've had the privilege to work with during my tenure. I\u2019m also very appreciative of the phenomenal experiences that I've been afforded and the positive impact both internal and external that this role and its responsibilities has enabled me to make. Some of the J&J successes that I'm very proud to have been associated with in partnership with my finance team and J&J colleagues include a consistent capital allocation strategy, where after investing in our business at competitive levels, we allocate capital first by paying dividends to our shareholders, then deploying capital for value creating acquisitions and finally using any excess cash to further return capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases. We've exceeded our competitor composite as well as most major indices for total shareholder returns over the last three, five, 10 and 20-year periods. And we returned two times more value to shareholders than compared our closest competitor over the last five years. And we\u2019re only one of seven mega cap companies to increase its market cap by more than $175 billion over the last 5.5 years. Finally, I'm proud to be associated with an incredible legacy of exceptional financial performance as reflected in our 34 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and our incredible 55 negative years of increasing our dividend to shareholders. And I know that the key to our success as an enterprise and therefore to my success has always been our credo, our purpose and our people as we've all united around the singular focus of changing the trajectory of health for humanity, a bold but inspiring purpose. I've been inspired every day since I began my career journey at Johnson & Johnson back in 1999 when I joined this great company as a result of the Centocor [ph] acquisition. I quickly realized that I joined a fantastic organization of incredibly dedicated, remarkably intelligent and really passionate people. As Alex Gorsky often says, our work in healthcare is not a job, it's a calling. Alex Gorsky, our CEO is truly inspirational committed and passionate leader. He has set a high standard for excellence in execution, but I want to sincerely thank Alex for his unwavering support through the years and for being my manager, colleague, partner and my very good friend. I also want to acknowledge the incredible management committee that I've had the pleasure to work with for many years. They are group of passionate and inspiring leaders. I\u2019m also very pleased to have one very important member here with us today, Joaquin Duato, and I\u2019d like to recognize and thank Joaquin for his bold and visionary leadership which has been integral in our pharmaceutical business delivering outstanding and sustained performance and growth. My time here at Johnson & Johnson has been without a doubt a humbling and amazing experience for almost two decades and I've had the honor of working alongside people, doing important and outstanding things that positively impact this world. I've enjoyed every minute of my stewardship of Johnson & Johnson's business as CFO and working with all of you. Thank you for your engagement, exchanges and partnership. And although Joe assumes his new role in July, I\u2019ll still be around for another couple months so we can work to closely ensure seamless transition. And you\u2019ll hear it from me again along with Alex at our May 16th Medical Device and Consumer Business review day. And I'm looking forward to seeing and talking personally with you then. Let me now turn things back over to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Great. Thank you, Dominic. That takes us to the Q&A portion of today's discussion. As a reminder Joaquin is available with Dominic to address your questions. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question. Operator : Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Joseph Wolk : Good morning, Mike. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thank you. And Dominic a personal note just to thank you for our relationship over the years, your stewardship of J&J. And I think you set a high bar for everyone in the industry. So, thank you for that. Dominic Caruso : Thank you, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Let me, Dominic, let me ask you a couple of items. So, if we go back to the fourth quarter, everybody kind of walked away a bit concerned about topline deceleration in the pharmaceutical business. This quarter you posted a better than expected performance. Can you just give us your thoughts on the outlook for the pharmaceutical business this year today, at April versus where you were in January? And it certainly looks like some of that upside is being driven by ZYTIGA which people are obviously still thinking about the life of that product. So can you give us any updated on your latest thoughts on ZYTIGA and generic competition timing? Thanks. Dominic Caruso : Sure, Mike. Well, we did have growth in the first quarter for pharma, reasonably consistent with fourth quarter growth of nearly 7.5%. And we did see a couple of factors that we were tracking. One was the continued erosion of REMICADE which in the first quarter was little higher than we expected. But that has to do with an adjustment as Joe mentioned with the one of our payers being delayed in requesting a true-up of the rebates. So we don\u2019t expect that that particular phenomenon is going to continue throughout the balance of the year, so the normalized erosion 16% is then therefore pretty consistent with what we expected. ZYTIGA did very well in the quarter. It started to do well, last year as a result of the LATITUDE data. It continued. I think that's a product that's continuing to improve patient's lives. Physicians are impressed with the data. And I'm happy to report obviously that we just launched ERLEADA as a follow-up. As I said, we don't expect that we\u2019ll see generic competition for ZYTIGA this year. So, we have it in our plans to continue to grow. Much of our guidance increase is related for the stronger performance of pharma. So as you know we don't give very specific guidance by sector. But I can tell you that the pharma business is driving most of our upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. Mike Weinstein : And as Joe -- yes\u2026 Joseph Wolk : Go ahead, Mike. Mike Weinstein : No, sorry. Either Joe or Dominic, you commented about the orthopedic business, your disappointment this quarter. How much of that do you think was J&J? And do have a view on whether this -- the market was in the U.S. was particularly weak this quarter, just looking at your knee and hip results? Dominic Caruso : Yes, Mike. It\u2019s a great question. I think if you look at knees and hips. Hips, we feel is still very well received in the marketplace. The ACTIS stem from everything we hear is qualitatively very strong. We do think that there was a selling day impact of roughly a point in orthopedics impacting the U.S. And there's also like qualitative or anecdotal suggestions that a rough flu season also impacted surgeries this quarter. With knees, we think we\u2019ll improve performance as we go throughout the year. As we come up with the ATTUNE Revision entering that the marketplace ATTUNE S+ as well as cementless offerings. So, I would say, it\u2019s a mixed bag that the market was a little bit softer due to some ancillary factors, but there\u2019s also some product performance that we can do as the year progresses. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Can you all hear me? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Hi, Jami. Jami Rubin : Okay. Yes, you can. Hi. Dominic, I too want to extend my congratulations and this is been an absolute pleasure to work with you. I think you are incredible class act. You and I have had some fun discussions over the years. You\u2019ve always been extremely respectful and I will always be grateful to that. So congratulations on your retirement and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to go ahead and do -- continue to do great things, and Joe, congratulations to you too. It\u2019s going to be fun to work with you. Anyway, on to the questions, wondering Dominic if you can provide a little bit more color around the comments related to supply chain action in an effort to reduce complexity and improve cost savings. Can you give more specific color around that? And you talk about 30 billion in additional investments over the next five years or so. Will the cost cutting initiatives the 600 to 800 annual savings offset the additional increases in investment? Will that fund the additional increases of investment? If you can just provide a little bit more color around that? And then, Joaquin, a question for you on Actelion, obviously something we\u2019ve been following closely. The trends certainly OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI do appear to be a little bit below our expectations and I know that you were really excited about this opportunity, growing and expanding the market. Just in light of the recent acquisition can you sort of give us a state of play, where you are with these assets? When should we start to see a bigger acceleration? Just wondering how you\u2019re performing relative to your own internal expectation? Thanks very much. Dominic Caruso : So let me take the supply chain question, Jami. So just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, so we have \u2013 as you know we have a wide ranging and complex supply chain due to various businesses and technologies that are required to produce our products. And looking forward into the future we need more of some newer technologies like biologics, like an investment in CAR-T for example. And we need less of the technologies that are related to some of the older parts of the portfolio. So we need to advance our manufacturing footprint to have more capacity with new technologies, less capacity with older technologies. We\u2019re going to do that from a position of strength, so that we\u2019re ready when our plans materialize and our strategies to continue to launch new products that have these new technologies embedded in them and we want to be ready for that. In terms of the cost savings we mentioned about $600 million to $800 million. That will be gradual over a period of time. We won\u2019t get to that level of $600 million to $800 million until we\u2019re near the end of the program which is about 2022. So -- and some of those cost savings will in fact help us offset things like pricing pressure or help us offset other investments in the company. In the aggregate, the $30 billion in additional both capital investment and R&D over the next four year period, I think is a good number for us regardless of these cost savings. We\u2019re committed to make these investments in the US for some of the technology that we just talked about and particularly additional R&D investment right here in the U.S. So, I think there are good numbers to plan for the future. Joaquin? Joaquin Duato : Yes. Thank you, Jami for the question. Let me start by saying a couple of headlines on the quarter of the pharmaceutical group. It was another strong quarter with above market growth, 15.1% growth and 7.5 when you exclude Actelion acquisition. And one of the important factors of this growth is that it was global both in the U.S. and international. And it was broadly based with eight of our key products growing double-digit. Importantly, also we made significant progress in our recently launched products and also in our pipeline TREMFYA with 72 million of sales in the quarter and 17% new-to-brand share in psoriasis in December is outpacing the anti-AL-17 class competitors, ERLEADA was also approved in February and we are seeing good uptick of ERLEADA with 80% of prescription coming from urologists. And I\u2019m also looking forward to the anticipated filing of esketamine in the second half of 2018. And you\u2019re going to see more data on this promising medicine in a few weeks at the APA Meeting. Finally let me get into your question about Actelion. And the answer is, Actelion is delivering as expected. We knew about the TRACLEER generics outside of the U.S. and we also expect to have TRACLEER generics in the U.S. later this year. However both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI are posting a strong demand growth and we anticipate that this performance is going to improve for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI during the year moving forward. So, let me give some details on OPSUMIT, OPSUMIT has new-to-brand share on the ERA category in the U.S. of 48% and in Europe of 60% demonstrating that even in the face of TRACLEER generics OPSUMIT is the preferred agent. We have 91% PREZCOBIX and 97% in commercial, showing that we have broad access in the U.S. So we are pleased about the progression of OPSUMIT and we anticipate that that we are going to continue to progress moving forward. And when it comes to UPTRAVI the new-to-brand share in the prostacyclin category is also 66% and we continue to make progress with it. And working in educating physicians about data of the study \u2013 the GRIPHON study indicating that earlier use of prostacyclin could have benefit. So we see positively the results so far and we anticipate that they are going to improve as the year progresses. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jami. Next question, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi. Good morning. And Dominic, you will missed and best of luck in retirement and spending more time with your grand kids and hope to be able to say good bye to you in person next month, So best of luck. Dominic Caruso : Thanks very much. Glenn Novarro : And I just had two questions for Joaquin on the pharma side. The first has to do with pharmaceutical pricing. Some of the drugs, XARELTO, ZYTIGA and REMICADE, they differed from our expectations based on our analysis of IMS data, which suggests there's pricing going on. So I\u2019m wondering if you can help us with REMICADE pricing with ZYTIGA pricing which again ZYTIGA came in much better, so I\u2019m assuming some of that was pricing. And then, XARELTO which came in later, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s more discounting in the market. So, if you can touch on those three drugs. And then just more specifically about pricing for the rest of the year, particularly in light of the next week President Trump I think is going to talk more broadly about his views on pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S. And then I just had a quick follow-up on STELARA and TREMFYA. Thanks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the questions, Glenn. Let me start with the general one on pharmaceutical pricing overall. As you mentioned, we expect that there\u2019s going to be an announcement on pricing by President Trump and that announcement will resemble the drug pricing policies including in the President\u2019s budget and the Council of Economic Advisers' report. Those policies were generally seeking to increase competition and to reduce out of pocket cost for patients while recognizing the value of innovation. We also understand that the announcement will include the request for information from the public on drug pricing issues and we are looking forward to participate there. Going into our pricing in the U.S and to your question on how do we see pricing trends for us in the U.S? We see that if you exclude REMICADE and the one-time adjustment that was referred by Joe earlier, we see a continuation of the trends that we have seen in the previous quarter. So we don\u2019t see a big change from what you saw in previous quarters. Specifically in your question of ZYTIGA, the increase of ZYTIGA is generally demand and share-driven. With the approval of LATITUDE we have seen a very significant growth of ZYTIGA in the U.S. and ex-U.S. with 53% growth year-over-year, 75% in the U.S. and 37% ex-U.S. AS a reminded, 55% of the sales of ZYTIGA are realized outside of the U.S. So the demand of ZYTIGA is very much shared and market-driven. When it comes to XARELTO, there is two factors that have influence XARELTO this quarter. The first thing I have to say is that, it grew 13% and it also gain share when you look year-over-year, so we gain 1.6 points of share in the anticoagulant market. When we look at the comparison with the previous quarter there are two factors that influence in. The first one is that we had an inventory build at the end of the third quarter due to Hurricane, Maria supply issues that we have burned in the first quarter. And the second one is that it happens every beginning of the year, every first quarter of the year, the new access agreement seeking and that also impacted our first quarter sequential comparison. So in general as I said we exclude the REMICADE situation. We see the pricing environment overall been similar to the trends we experienced in the previous quarters. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Glenn. Glenn Novarro : Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Next question, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Joseph Wolk : Why don\u2019t we move on to the next question, Rob, then we can put Geoff back in. Operator : Yes. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Josh Jennings : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And I\u2019ll be brief. Dominic, you will missed and it sad to see you go and congratulations Joe on the new seat. I was hoping just to start off with a question on guidance for Dominic. Just on the pretax operating margin guidance increased with I think 150 basis points from approximately 100, I believe, on the fourth quarter call. The 1Q pretax operating margin performance was flattish. Was there some one-time issue in 1Q? Or can you just help us outside of the bump in the top line you also have a reduction in other income? So what are some of the drivers that are leading to that increased outlook, improved outlook for the operating margin performance for the rest of the year? Dominic Caruso : Sure. Well, we saw very good cost of goods sold performance in the first quarter. It was down 140 basis points, has to do with the mix of the products sold, but also the great work that\u2019s done in our supply chain to be more efficient in manufacturing. We also have as you saw relatively a slower increase in the rate of selling marketing and expenses in relation to the rate of sales increase. So we\u2019re still investing there. But we\u2019re obviously leveraging the business in terms of productivity that\u2019s particularly pronounced our pharmaceutical business. And then the other income and expense line, we have a lower expectation. Now simply due to the timing there\u2019s a number of activities that we undertake. Each year we look to \u2013 obviously look to further enhance our portfolio by exiting some lower growth categories or brands or products and entering new ones. And they are always difficult to predict, Josh, and we just think that some of them will move over into 2019. We\u2019re still on track with many of them, but we\u2019ll probably see some more in 2019 than in 2018. And so, we decided it will be prudent to just lower that expectation. Again, completely offset by the stronger performance in the business and improved pretax operating margin as I just mentioned. Josh Jennings : Great. And I was hoping to just follow-up with a high level question on the medical device business. I understand we\u2019re going to get a lot of details next month. But just in terms of thinking about the executive team\u2019s patience with that business unit, I mean it seems as if recent strategy has been to proven lower growth, lower margin business units with some tuck-ins. Is that how we should think about the strategy going forward? Is continue with internal R&D and continued pruning? Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Dominic Caruso : Well, Josh, just to put it in perspective, I mean, there are areas within the medical device business that are really very strong, right. So our vision business is doing exceptionally well. Electrophysiology doing exceptionally well, endocutters doing well, our trauma business is back on track. And so having said that we do have areas where we need to improve and we\u2019ll improve in those areas through a number of factors. As we've always done at Johnson & Johnson over the years. A good mix of internal innovation and acquisitions and new technologies, I don't think that's ever been an issue for us. We\u2019ve always been able to do that. And you will obviously talk more about it on May 16 when you\u2019ll get to hear from the leaders of the business who are responsible for their business both on what's happened in the market and with our products and the enthusiasm they have for the launch of new products and new areas that they\u2019re getting into, so I look forward to joining you for that and we\u2019ll hear a lot more about that than. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Josh. Next question, Rob. Operator : Your next question is coming from the line Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Dominic Caruso : Yes. Hi, Geoff. Geoff Meacham : Perfect. Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the question and let me also offer congrats to both Dominic and to Joe. Dominic Caruso : Thanks Geoff. Geoff Meacham : Just had a few on the pharma segment, so Joaquin, when you look at the DARZALEX trajectory, the growth has obviously been quite good, but how do you think about where adoption trends could go into first-line myeloma? And then in this market how disruptive could the BCMA class do you think could be to the myeloma market? And then a follow-up more broadly for Dominic, now that you have Actelion deal fully integrated. I want to get your perspective on attitudes towards pharma growth going forward? Are you comfortable with the level today? Do you feel like a bolt-on would be helpful to the tick up growth or is the pipeline kind of set for more of an inflection looking out say 12 to 24 months? Joaquin Duato : Okay. So thanks for the question and thank you asking about DARZALEX. As you\u2019ve seen this actually been a very rapid uptake. With adoption both in the hospital and in the clinic, to-date in the U.S. we have had already 21,000 patients treated DARZALEX. And as you have seen we are posting a strong growth with 64% in the quarter. Largely this is due to our increasing share in line two in which we had in the first quarter, 24% of new-to-brand, so, really are very positive result. What is going to be the next growth driver? As you mentioned it\u2019s going to first-line. We are expecting the approval of our first-line indication in the U.S. in this first couple of the year and that is the study that we are comparing with BMP. And then we also are expecting that data read of our additional first-line studies, the one with REVLIMID and the one in transplant eligible later this year. So that body of data in first-line is going to be the driver of future growth of XARELTO or excuse me, of DARZALEX. What is interesting to see is that in every single study that we have done with DARZALEX we have add DARZALEX to different combos. DARZALEX has always in every single one including the ALCYONE has always been able to double the PFS and to triple the MRD showing the synergistic effect that DARZALEX had in every treatment regimen. So we are very positive about how DARZALEX is doing. And we believe that as you mention the next wave of growth with DARZALEX is going to come with adoption in first-line subsequent to the approval that we\u2019ll have in this first half of the year. Dominic Caruso : And Geoff, I think undoubtedly our strategy in pharma has been very successful for a long period of time which includes a good mix of internal and external development and quite frankly they are picking the right products and collaborating with others in some very important areas like in oncology. So good examples are IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX are two really good examples. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. We just announced the collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb on a new anticoagulant, mechanism of action of Factor XIa. So that is been the hallmark of our success in pharma and I think that'll continue. The pipeline is very strong. We\u2019re now -- eight more products we intent to file between now and 2021, each having a billion-dollar potential. Having said that, there maybe times when there's an opportunity to do a great deal in pharma like we did with Actelion. And that depends on the right price with the right partner at the right time. And we think that generates value for our shareholders, we\u2019ll do that. But I would say, we have a very, very good, solid pipeline already and our collaboration strategy has proved to be remarkable and I think that'll continue as the primary way of growing the pharma business. Joaquin Duato : If we look even forward the next \u2013 the other important event with DARZALEX for the first-line approval it\u2019s going to be the subcu formulation. We have now four ongoing Phase III studies with the subcu formulation and we expect the filing before 2021. So that would create another opportunity for DARZALEX to improve patient convenience and to continue to grow adoption. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Joe. Next question, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Wolk : Good morning, David. David Lewis : Good morning. Dominic, we\u2019re running out of superlatives to subscribe your tenure. So I would say, congratulations and I hope Joe has big feet. So, Dominic, one for you and then one for Joaquin here. So, we think about the first quarter Dominic as relates to basically the guidance, is first quarter kind of a decent proxy for the year as it relates to growth? So basically if pharma gets better this year, consumer gets a little better and devices is more flattish? Dominic Caruso : Well, I think the way to think about the first quarter there's a few things that will not continue. For example, in the first quarter we had some timing of tenders in Europe. So you see the very strong pharma performance in Europe that has a lot to do with the timing of tenders in Europe and that obviously doesn\u2019t continue with every quarter. We also had this particular adjustment that we talked about that was negative in first quarter, a catch up on rebates from one of the major payers. And we do expect that we\u2019ll see an acceleration of TRACLEER and PROCRIT generic erosion going into the balance of the year. At the same time, we expect that medical devices will continue to accelerate as well as consumer. So overall we had some puts and takes in the first quarter. We've increased our overall guidance about a half a point from our current -- from the previous expectations and we\u2019ll update you more obviously as we see second quarter results. But overall I think we're in great shape and I'm pretty confident we\u2019re going to deliver on a good solid year of this year as we did last year. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And then two follow-ups from me on the pharma. The first is just on REMICADE. You talked about that being kind one-time, but is that sort of 16% adjusted number decline. Is that a good way to think about that the balance of the year? And then for Joaquin on esketamine, obviously, a key product launch back half of this year, hasn't come up much on the call. I know we\u2019ll see data here in the second quarter, can you just talk about the size of that commercial opportunity and how you think your confidence in that commercial ramp, just given the unique dynamics of this market? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question on REMICADE, I think that the 15%, 16% that you quoted is a good way to think about the erosion moving forward this year. The related with Esketamine we are very excited about Esketamine, it\u2019s been a long time that we don\u2019t have a new mechanics of action in the treatment of \u2013 treatment kind of depression. As you know Esketamine uniquely has two breakthrough designations, one in treatment of depression and the other one in suicidal ideation. And we are looking forward to be able to file in the second half of this year and you are going to see more data in the phase III, one of the phase III studies at the upcoming APA. So what is the medical meet here? I mean you know how many people uses antidepressants and you know how many people that is using antidepressants is not getting the right response. So you are talking about millions of patients in this case. It\u2019s one of the categories more used in all the pharmaceutical market, so the commercial and patient opportunity is very very significant and I think it\u2019s one that has been underestimated generally. This is going to be uniquely if we are able to demonstrate that in the phase III studies which are going to be the most important thing to look after. It\u2019s going to be the first time that a new medicine is able to demonstrate efficacy on top of an active medication. So that has been never demonstrated, so it would be the first time that any medicine is able to demonstrate efficacy on top of an active medication. So we believe that it has very significant opportunity. It also builds on our expertise in CNS; remember that we are the leading company in schizophrenia with our long-acting therapy franchise which by the way posted double digit growth this quarter. We have a strong equity in the psychiatric community and we have a very good understanding of how to manage site of care issues based on our experience in REMICADE and in orders helping physicians to be able to appropriately administer the medicine at the site of care. So we are very confident on Esketamine, we are very confident also in our capability in being able to translate good clinical data, a potential approval into patient access through our ability to manage site of care market access for this product. Thanks for the questions, David. Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Joaquin Duato : Good morning, Danielle. Dominic Caruso : Hi, Danielle. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and Dominic, thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done over the years and I\u2019m very grateful for the relationship that we\u2019ve developed. Joe excited for you and to work with you going forward even more. So, I just wanted to ask a question as it relates to the commentary about the incremental $30 billion now with tax reform and how to think about the approach you guys are going to take between incremental investment in organic R&D versus inorganic capital deployment, does that change the strategy at all or potentially make you get more aggressive on the inorganic front? Dominic Caruso : Yes, well Danielle just to clarify, so $30 billion invested in R&D and capital investments in the U.S. which is a 15% increase over the prior four year period. And in terms of the mix, I think we will continue to look for productivity from our incredible efforts in R&D particularly in the pharma business where we investment at the higher rates in the industry in R&D. So I think we\u2019ll continue to maintain that, we\u2019ll continue to do as I said earlier to an earlier question collaborate, and bring on both on our products in pharma as well as cross medical devices, but you know look 50% of our growth over long periods of time has come from acquisitions, have come from external enabled growth and I don\u2019t think that will change going forward. It\u2019s just a matter of the right asset at the right price that will create value for shareholders. I don\u2019t see a major shift in our strategy in that regard. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the question, Danielle. Next question, Rob? Operator : Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Dominic, congratulations on your timing, it truly was a pleasure working with you and Joe, congratulations on your new role. Joaquin Duato : Thanks, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Two quick questions. One financial one Pharma, so Dominic you guided to 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion of other income in 2018. Did this become a headwind to EPS growth next year or do you expect that to remain at an elevated level via additional divestitures, I think in the past Dominic you said that, that line underlying other income excluding one-time items is $500 million to $600 million is that still the case basically, how do you want us to think about that line going forward. And I\u2019ll just quickly fit in the pharma question, it\u2019s a quick one. Working on the COMPASS trial, do you expect an FDA panel? Is it possible still to get an accelerated review and how are you thinking about that impacting XARELTO growth? Thanks for taking the questions guys. Dominic Caruso : Sure, well Larry this 1.5 to 1.7 is lower than our previous guidance as you know and that\u2019s because of timing primarily so some of the activities are going to shift into 2019, so that gives us quite a head start on that line if you will for 2019. And we are going to continue to look at optimizing our portfolio. When we do that, we have these gains and we typically use some of those gains to invest back in the business, so you see a higher, much higher level of R&D investment if you compare it to any prior period when the line is lower in prior period. So it\u2019s not always just driving earnings, in fact it utilized it\u2019s basically a portfolio decision. We\u2019re investing in new products, with the gains that we get from divesting products. I think that will be the case going forward. I think the 500 to 600 that I mentioned earlier is still a good underlying number for that line, and as I mentioned we\u2019re seen improvements in our pretax operating margin and we expect that will continue to grow as the consumer business ramps back up and the medical device business improves and obviously the continued strength of Pharma, so even if that line is a little bit lower going forward we have the higher pretax operating margin which will drive our earnings growth. As you know Larry, we generally look to grow our sales at a better pace that\u2019s faster than the markets we compete in, but then we also look to grow our earnings at a pace that slightly faster than the rate of growth in sales, I think will continue to do that through the right mix on the P&L. Joaquin Duato : So thank you for the question on XARELTO [ph]. We are very also excited about COMPASS and the COMPASS result. As you recall, we presented the COMPASS results at the ESC in August last year and the results were impressive with 24% risk reduction in MACE. We filed in December and we are anticipating potential approval in the fourth quarter of this year. Regarding an Advisory Committee, I cannot comment on that, we don\u2019t know. So what is the market opportunity and the relevance and significance of COMPASS. As we have discussed with you in the past, this is a population of about 10 million potential patients you know that that those would be lower 2.5 milligram in combination with aspirin [ph] and it\u2019s a new treatment paradigm, so we are very excited about being able to bring this new therapeutic option here. It\u2019s also important from my competitive perspective. We are the only new oral anticoagulant that has this broad development program called Explorer that contains a reduction in MACE for CAD/PAD patients but also all indications that I will comment and that will enable us to do a couple of important things. First, have a new grow driver for XARELTO in addition of the existing set of indications. Second, differentiate ourselves from the competition and in that case gain share in the particular anticoagulant market. And third, as we will be the only one to have this indication we have differentiated those, also have a stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis the payers. So we think it\u2019s a very significant opportunity for us. And as I said this is only part of multiple Phase III indications seeking a study that we have in XARELTO. So COMPASS is one, but if I can refresh your memory there, you know that we also have the MARINER, the COMMANDER studies that will read this year, respectively, in medically ill patients and congestive heart failure that also represent a very significant opportunity to upgrade the standard of care of anticoagulation in these patients. So overall, the EXPLORER program that is going to start with the COMPASS study it\u2019s going to be a growth driver for XARELTO that is going to put us in a much better position moving forward from that competitive perspective. Joseph Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Larry. Rob, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more. Operator : Yes, it is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Joaquin Duato : Good morning, Bob. Bob Hopkins : Hey good morning and also let me offer my congratulations to both Dominic and Joe because those statistics were obviously very impressive. Yes, since the device day \u2013 device and consumer day is coming up, I thought I\u2019d ask two quick device questions. One, on the ortho sort of pure pricing numbers that you provided in prepared remarks. I was just curious, are those U.S. numbers and they did seem a little worse. Is there something going on with pure price that\u2019s worth calling out, that was the first question? And I\u2019ll just sort of rattle off the second one. I was curious at the upcoming analyst day you know how much detail you might be willing to provide or are going to provide on the surgical robotics JV. Will we get a lot of specifics in terms of timelines and seeing the device or is it too early to be specific? Thank you very much. Joaquin Duato : Yes, so Bob with respect to the price, that was U.S. only, and we provided this quarter pure price. In the past we put it in with mix but then we found out that you and your peers would simply ask for it on the follow-up cost, so we thought it was just little bit more clear. In terms of overall pure price trends, we haven\u2019t seen any deviation from what\u2019s consistently been in place for the past few quarters. And at the upcoming medical device and consumer day, we will have a dedicated portion of the program on surgical robotics. We\u2019ll talk about the current status of the venture that we have with -- through with Verily. We'll give you as much as we can, a description of the current state of the of the robot. We\u2019ll show you some aspects of it of course, we want to be careful as to the competitive issues that that could raise, but I feel you\u2019ll get a good understanding of where we are, how it works, how it\u2019s different and we\u2019ll also talk about Orthotaxy, the new knee robotic technology that we just acquired, Bob. So that will be a dedicated portion of the session to bring everyone up to date. Joseph Wolk : Great. So thanks Bob for the question and to everyone who asked the question today. And apologies to those who we could not get due to time, but certainly don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as you need to do follow-up. I will now turn the call back to Dominic for some closing remarks. Dominic Caruso : Thanks Joe. And I want to sincerely thank all of you here in the room with me and listening on the phone for the tremendous support partnership you\u2019ve given me and Johnson & Johnson each and every quarter. It\u2019s hard to believe this is the 46th quarter that I\u2019ve done this. So it\u2019s been a pleasure. I also want take one more opportunity to express my confidence and our guidance for this year, the overall success of our business, and I\u2019m very optimistic about the future of Johnson & Johnson. I look forward to seeing you all on May 16 at our consumer and medical device business review day. Thanks for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joseph Wolk : Hello. This is Joe Wolk, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Investor Conference Call to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the second quarter of 2018. I am pleased to be joined for a discussion by Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also helping us out today is Matt Stuckley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. I am very honored, excited and humbled to assume the role for this great company.  Dominic Caruso leaves a lasting impact on the business in many ways. I want to personally thank him for his commitment to this transition. He has been very gracious with his time. It\u2019s great to be surrounded by the many talented and dedicated people of Johnson & Johnson who strived every day to make a positive difference in the lives of all stakeholders outlined in our credo.  And I want to thank you on this webcast for the support and kind words since the announcement. I look forward to our continued partnership.  As far as naming a new Head of Investor Relations, we have many qualified associates to choose from and we will be making that announcement in the near future. Well, as far as the first earnings call, I would hope you agree that the business did their part to help me ease into the role. Our solid second quarter results which reflects our highest adjusted operational sales growth since the second quarter of 2016 were driven by the strong double-digit growth in pharmaceuticals and accelerating sales momentum in our Medical Device business.  Consumer sales were below our expectations. However, there were some onetime factors that depressed reported results. That said, we need to do better in the Consumer segment and have plans in place to accelerate growth in the back half of the year with many new product introductions.  Let me now turn the call over to Matt to cover some housekeeping matters and kick off the sales review. Matthew Stuckley : Thanks, Joe, and hello everyone. Regarding today\u2019s agenda, I will start by summarizing enterprise sales and earnings per share for the quarter before turning it back to Joe for segment sales highlights. Alex will then provide his perspective on the company and the healthcare environment.  Joe will conclude formal remarks discussing our earnings results and guidance considerations, as you update your models before we open the call up for your questions. We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 75 minutes. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There you can also find additional materials including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today's discussion, as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the second quarter.  Now, on to the results. Worldwide sales were $20.8 billion for the second quarter of 2018, a 10.6% increase versus the second quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 8.7%, as currency had a positive impact of 1.9%. In the U.S., sales were up 9.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.9% with the effect of currency exchange rates benefitting our reported OUS results by 3.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.3% worldwide, 5.7% in the U.S. and 6.8% outside the U.S. Joe will provide the same reference for each segment. With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.45 versus $1.40 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.10 representing increases of 14% and 14.8% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11.5%. Now I will turn the call back to Joe to go over sales highlights by segment. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Matt. Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment highlighting items that build upon the slides that are being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages referenced represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2017 or in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion declining operationally 0.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the COMPEED business in the Wound Care other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 0.9% worldwide.  Performance in the quarter included the one-time impacts of a transportation strike in Brazil and a retail inventory reset for the U.S. Baby relaunch. Taking those items into account, adjusted operational growth would have been consistent with Q1 at approximately 2%.  Our largest consumer franchise, the OTC business led the segment with above market performance growing at 3.7% driven by share gains across multiple brands. Analgesics, namely TYLENOL and digestive products drove the growth. The Beauty franchise grew 1.8% operationally.  As we referenced last quarter, growth in this quarter was expected to be negatively impacted by the Q1 seasonal inventory build of approximately $20 million or $300 basis points in the U.S. related to sun protection products stocking.  This is primarily reflected in NEUTROGENA. Growth in the quarter was driven by market expansion and share growth for OGX and Dr. Ci Labo, as well as new product introductions in NEUTROGENA outside the U.S.  Oral care performance in the U.S. saw solid growth of nearly 5% due to strong LISTERINE consumption from ongoing promotions and new products. The divestitures of the REACH and REMBRANDT brands negatively impacted worldwide growth by just over 1 point. The OUS declines are due to competitive pressures. As I mentioned earlier, Baby care results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the U.S. Baby relaunch as retailers reset their shelves for the new products that started shipping in July. Results outside the U.S. reflect competitive pressures partially offset by continued expansion of AVEENO Baby. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $10.4 billion grew 17.6%. Excluding the net impact of the Actelion acquisition, operational adjusted sales growth was 11% worldwide representing strong above market growth.  Growth was broadly based, both geographically, as well as across therapeutic areas with double-digit growth in nine key products including pro forma sales for UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT obtained in the Actelion acquisition. The segment was led by the oncology portfolio, which grew globally 39%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing globally by approximately 68%. In the U.S., market growth and the strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries in which it is now commercially available, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region where it received approval late last year.  IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained more than three points of market share versus prior year across all lines of therapy based on first quarter data largely driven by share in line one Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or CLL. The CLL market is estimated to have grown approximately 13%. ZYTIGA had another strong quarter growing 60% due to the continued market growth of approximately 33% and strong share growth in the metastatic high-risk castration sensitive prostate cancer indication based on the LATITUDE clinical trial.  Our Immunology franchise posted 12% sales growth despite the negative impact of biosimilars on REMICADE sales. Growth was led by STELARA up 34% where we remained very pleased with the uptake of the Crohn\u2019s disease indication. Market share has improved 10 points in Crohn\u2019s disease, compared to the second quarter of 2017.  REMICADE in the U.S. declined approximately 14%, largely driven by price erosion. REMICADE has retained approximately 94% of the Infliximab volume share.  Lastly, in Immunology, sales for a newly launched treatment for psoriasis TREMFYA totaled $126 million due to strong demand with over 15,000 patients now on therapy. TREMFYA has already achieved a 5% share of the psoriasis market.  In Neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio grew steadily in all regions driven by new patient starts and persistency. Results for the Actelion pulmonary hypertension assets acquired in June 2017 are comminuted here on a pro forma basis. OPSUMIT growth accelerated globally to 16% due to increased share and market growth. UPTRAVI continues to experience strong demand with 41% growth in the U.S.  Of note, the dynamic we highlighted in recent quarters regarding an increased level of patients on assistance programs in the U.S. has improved. As expected, TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year. Turning our attention to the Medical Devices segment, worldwide Medical Device sales were $7 billion growing 1.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9% worldwide.  We acknowledge there is still work to do here but this represents our strongest growth since Q3 2016 and is a positive step toward the above market growth we plan to achieve in 2020 highlighted during our recent Business Review Day. Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Interventional Solutions and Vision, as well as improving growth in surgery. Within Interventional Solutions, our market leadership in electrophysiology coupled with our new product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters continued to propel the overall market and our own growth which was more than 17% worldwide.  Vision delivered strong growth in both the contact lens and surgical business across key geographies totaling $1.2 billion in sales and worldwide growth of 9.6%. The contact lens business grew a very healthy 10.5% on the strength of our ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE moist lines, most notably, in our market-leading astigmatism lenses.  In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 7.5% was driven by the cataract business, primarily intraocular lenses.  In Orthopedics, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, performance was flat to the second quarter of 2017. In Trauma, growth is driven by our newer products like the TFNA Femoral Nail. In Hips, we continue to be the market-leader in the anterior approach and see strong demand for the primary stem actives although we estimate the market growth was only about 1% in the U.S.  Subsequent to the quarter, we completed the acquisition of assets from Medical Enterprises Distribution, which includes the automated ME1000 Surgical Impactor for use in hip replacement. The new name for this technology is the Concise Surgical Automated System.  In Spine and in Knees, we are losing share. However, new product launches in Spine and launch of the ATTUNE revision system in Knees, led to improved performance this quarter in both businesses.  Selling days did provide a benefit of approximately one point to Orthopedics growth for the quarter offsetting the negative impact we noted in the first quarter. We do not expect selling days to have a material impact on results for the remainder of the year.  Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative 5% in Spine, negative 3% in Hips, negative 2% in Knees and negative 1% in Trauma. Within the surgery group, the advanced surgery category was strong leg by growth outside the U.S.  On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 7% as new products are experiencing strong demand and bio surgery grew over 8% driven by Topical Absorbable Hemostats & Biologics. In General Surgery, Wound Closure grew 5% with growth in all regions as barbed and plus sutures are experiencing strong adoption.  As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the first quarter of 2018, we saw a slight increase in hospital emissions of 50 basis points. Surgical procedures were down approximately 1% and lab procedures were up about 2.5%. Our preliminary estimates for the second quarter indicate consistent rates for hospital emissions and surgical procedures with lab procedure growth lowering to approximately 1.5%.  That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 second quarter. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Joe, and thank all of you for joining our second quarter earnings call and webcast today. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our strong performance in the second quarter of 2018 and how we are well positioned for the rest of the year and for the future. Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance to-date both for the first half of this year, as well as in the second quarter. Our accelerating sales and EPS growth results exceeded consensus estimates. Following my remarks, Joe will provide deeper insight into how our performance and outlook will impact our full year guidance for 2018.  Before I provide some perspective by business segment, it\u2019s important to begin where I usually do emphasizing that we are always guided by our credo and this year, we proudly celebrate its 75th anniversary. Our credo is as relevant today as the day it was written, balancing opportunity and responsibility we are united and inspired by our credo and we live into the responsibilities it outlines each and every day.  It reminds us that our first responsibility is to our customers and patients and it compels us to deliver on our responsibilities to our employees, our communities, our environment, and last but not least, our shareholders. And the success we achieved can be directly attributed to our more than 134,000 diverse and talented Johnson & Johnson employees in 60 countries around the world who exhibit our credo values every day in every way  I am also proud to share that we released our Johnson & Johnson 2017 Health For Humanity Report in June which highlights how we are preparing for the future, meeting our enduring commitments to create long-term value and positively contributing to society. This report shares the progress that we are making toward our Health For Humanity 2020 goals and our UN Sustainable Development goals.  To complement the report, we also conducted our first ever Health For Humanity webcast to engage in deeper discussion about the report\u2019s contents on environmental, social and governance topics. This session recording is available on our company website as well.  We recognize that to lead the next frontier of health is a big commitment. We are ready, willing and able to take on this mission guided by our purpose-driven strategies and values rooted in our credo, we will always seek to put the needs in well-being of the people we serve first. Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight that a few weeks ago, we announced Sandy Peterson, Executive Vice President and Group Worldwide Chairman had decided to retire from Johnson & Johnson effective October 1, 2018. Sandy joined Johnson & Johnson in 2012 and over her time with our company, she has had responsibility for our Consumer and Medical Device segments in addition to other business functions.  I am sure Sandy will approach the next stage of her life with the same energy that she brought to us. Please join me in wishing her all the best in this new chapter of her life. In conjunction with Sandy\u2019s decision to retire, we implemented additional management changes that will ensure continued focus on delivering our commitments to all of our stakeholders named in our credo. Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels have been promoted to Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. The role of Vice Chair has traditionally been a part of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s leadership structure and in place for most of our company\u2019s history.  In the Vice Chair roles, both Joaquin and Paul will leverage their expertise and credo-based leadership broadly across the organization and provide the enterprise with additional strategic counsel, direction and oversight.  I am also pleased to announce that Ashley McEvoy has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman Medical Devices, which includes her continued leadership of our Vision business. Additionally, Jennifer Taubert will assume responsibility for the Pharmaceutical business and both Jennifer and Ashley will be members of the Executive Committee.  Ashley and Jennifer are exceptional long-tenured Johnson & Johnson leaders with proven track records of success and who both embody credo-based leadership. These and other changes we have made in recent months recognize the deep bench of strength within our company and how we are utilizing the skills of our many talented leaders who will ensure that we continue to create value for our patients, consumers and our shareholders.  Now, as you\u2019ve heard me say on several occasions, innovation has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of every life-saving and life-changing product and solution that we provide to people around the world and sustaining innovation has been the basis of our success and what has driven our growth and value through the years and will for many years to come.  Increasing investment and innovation is a critical aspect of our strategy and the foundation for our future. In fact, last year we ranked number five in the U.S. and number eight globally across all industries for R&D investment and through the first two quarters of 2018, due to the benefits of the enacted U.S. tax legislation, we highlighted earlier this year, we have increased our investment in R&D by approximately 16% with the objective of developing new products and solutions that address today\u2019s medical needs and anticipate the medical needs of the future.  We continue to invest internally at a very healthy rate progressing the rich pipelines across our three business segments and optimizing the innovative collaboration that happens within the walls of our company. And as you know, we recognize that good ideas come from everywhere. This is why we also seek and choose dynamic external partners to innovate with and who can help us unlock new treatments for patients and solutions for our customers.  We are always on the lookout for value-creating opportunities and collaborations and to this end, we have closed seven major acquisitions of licensing deals since the beginning of this year. We also continue to enhance our status as a preferred partner being agnostic toward the best science and technology resides and aggressively pursuing transformational innovation.  Additionally, we regularly evaluate each of our businesses to determine that they still fit our strategy and our criteria for value creation. And as you have seen us do consistently, what it makes sense we undertake a process to consider a different ownership for a business might be value-enhancing or if a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio. Recently, we announced the acceptance of a binding offer for our LifeScan business and the receipt of a binding offer for our ASP business. We expect to complete the LifeScan transaction by the end of this year and should the offer our ASP business be accepted, the proposed transaction would be expected to close in early 2019 subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals.  Our activity in both mergers and acquisitions reflects our capital allocation priorities, which have remained consistent and we believe proven. First, as I just highlighted, we prioritize investing in our business at competitive levels then we allocate capital to drive long-term value by placing a priority on paying dividends to our shareholders, next we deploy capital for value-creating acquisitions and finally, we evaluate further opportunities to return value to our shareholders such as through share repurchases.  Johnson & Johnson has the financial strength and cash flow to simultaneously return value to shareholders while at the same time continuing to invest in internal and external opportunities that further strengthen our robust enterprise pipeline and drive long-term growth. Now, I want to provide a few highlights about each of our business segments, but first, I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that we continue to think of ourselves as a 132 year old startup innovating and executing each and every day to win our customers\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 trust, confidence and support.  We have a strong sense of urgency we are not complacent and we are not looking back, we are looking forward and moving forward as fast as the change happening all around this on the global, technological, social, economic, political and healthcare fronts. We believe Johnson & Johnson is strongly positioned for continued and future growth.  Our Pharmaceutical business has delivered outstanding and sustained performance, growing at an adjusted rate of 11% inclusive of the impact of negative net price driven by the successful launches and growth of many blockbuster medicines. It has been an industry leader in all performance measures including R&D productivity and commercial capabilities. Earlier this year, we launched ERLEADA, a treatment for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This is a second of up to ten promising new therapeutics that we plan to file our launch by 2021. Each of these new therapeutics has the potential for more than $1 billion of peak revenue.  Throughout the rest of 2018, we have identified several other key catalysts for growth which focus on; continued patient penetration in oncology areas of prostate cancer and hematology, a growing immunology portfolio driven by the continued growth of established brands like STELARA, which is a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases and new products like TREMFYA which treats adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and this growth is even more impressive when you consider the REMICADE erosion due to biosimilars.  Also, the pulmonary hypertension assets we acquired last year, which by the way this second quarter represents the strongest quarter we\u2019ve had to-date in this area led by OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And the continued solid performance in long-acting injectables in neuroscience, XARELTO, and our HIV portfolio.  We are confident that the continued growth of our marketed products and the expected launches from our robust pipeline position us well to outgrow the market for many years to come, while offering life-saving or life-changing solutions that give new hope to patients around the world.  Now let me spend some time on our Consumer segment. As discussed at our Consumer and Medical Device business review back in May, I am confident in our strategies to move quickly to address new market needs with an omni-channel approach from the large box retailers to the e-commerce channels to better serve our consumers.  The Consumer\u2019s second quarter sales growth was disappointing and as Joe mentioned, this was driven by the impact of some one-time events. That said, we recognize that we need to perform better here and we believe we are positioned for a strong second half of this year based on our strong underlying consumption data.  Additionally, we are revitalizing our Baby business, in fact, beginning this month, our newly formulated Johnson\u2019s Baby products has started to ship to retailers across the United States. We continue to strengthen and expand our portfolio of iconic science-based and professionally endorsed products and we have a number of planned launches in the second half of this year.  We also believe that this will drive top-line growth that will be met with even greater bottom-line growth as we continue to improve our productivity and margins.  In Medical Devices, we have powerful opportunities for growth across our Orthopedics, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision businesses. We have businesses which again displayed great strength in the second quarter such as Vision and Electrophysiology reaching double-digit growth and biosurgery and endocutters reaching high-single-digit growth.  But we fully recognize that our progress has not been uniform across the entire portfolio. There are areas where we must and we will improve such as in our Knee and Spine businesses, both of which took positive steps forward in Q2, while growth was still negative, our Knee business improved performance compared to the last quarter driven by the recent launch of our ATTUNE revision platform.  Similarly, our Spine business improved performance in the second quarter due to the new products we\u2019ve launched in this space. We\u2019ve also increased investments across our Medical Device portfolio in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions that our customers are demanding. Additionally, we are improving our cadence of innovation and are on track to deliver 15 to 20 major product launches planned for 2018.  We are driving innovation, partnering closer with customers, simplifying operations and focusing on execution, all to meet the needs of customers and patients, when, where and how they want their needs to be met. We believe these drivers will deliver sustainable, above market growth across the entire breadth of our Medical Devices businesses starting today and we are committed to delivering across the portfolio in 2020.  Now as a broadest based healthcare company, when we look at the current marketplace, business landscape and external environment, we are often asked about the potential impacts to our business and industries. Let me address a few of those topics that are in the current headlines. Regarding the recent St. Louis Talcum Powder lawsuit and verdict, as you know, our Baby Powder is a trusted product that we sold to families for over 100 years and Johnson & Johnson is deeply disappointed in this verdict. Now, we remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer and we intend to pursue all available appellate remedies.  In fact, every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed.  Additionally, I want to emphasize that preeminent scientific and regulatory bodies including The National Cancer Institute, The US Food and Drug Administration have fully reviewed the full body of scientific evidence on multiple occasions and found that it does not support the allegation that talc causes ovarian cancer. Like previous appeals, we are confident that there are multiple grounds for a reversal of this jury verdict and that ultimately the case will be reversed.  Regarding global trade, as a global company, Johnson & Johnson relies on free trade and open markets to bring its products to patients and consumers around the world. We continue to work with government officials because fair and equitable trade is in everyone\u2019s best interest, not just for companies but for the consumer.  We will continue to monitor developments very closely on this front as we expect this to be an issue in motion for some time.  Regarding overall healthcare costs and drug pricing in the United States, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. First, let me say that we understand why there is such a passionate dialogue on this topic. We know that people are facing higher out-of-pocket cost, when they seek medical care from a hospital, a doctor\u2019s office or some other alternative healthcare provider, and especially when they go to the pharmacy to get medications.  However as a point of reference, medicines represent 14% of the total healthcare cost in the United States and medical devices represents 6% of the total healthcare cost in the United States. The remaining 80% is accounted for by areas outside of our industry. I\u2019d also like to emphasize that the value derived from innovative medicines has been and continues to be significant in addressing health issues today and reducing morbidity rates in the future. Furthermore, medicines have contributed greatly to extending life expectancy. For example, cancer deaths have declined 20% due to pharmaceutical treatments since the 90s. All these improvements actually offset healthcare costs in the U.S. We also believe changes are needed regarding how we cover and pay for medical care and drug treatment therapies in the U.S. We are working with various partners in the healthcare system to transform the way healthcare is paid for, so everyone involved is held accountable and rewarded for the value they deliver. That said, there are a few items that we typically focus on when participating in the healthcare cost and drug pricing dialogue and they include; first, a system that rewards innovation, companies need to continue to fund research and science and technology and invest in new ideas and new products.  We have the best healthcare system in the world here in the U.S. and we want a system that allows us to keep it that way. We also want to see a system that is personalized and value-based. A value-based system begins and ends with the patient at the center of every consideration and is judged on the overall outcome. Striving to provide patients with convenience and innovative capabilities for healthcare management, affordable access and coverage choices and personalized healthcare experiences remains a top priority for Johnson & Johnson.  Second, transparency. I am really proud that our Pharmaceutical business is taking a lead in transparency in the industry. We just issued our second annual report on transparency and as a matter of fact, this year\u2019s report shows a decrease in net prices for the products in our portfolio. Our Janssen U.S. transparency report shows, in 2017 the net impact of price on our Pharmaceutical business was minus 4.6% after rebates and discounts of nearly $15 billion.  And lastly, as we continue to engage in dialogue and develop proposals that contain healthcare cost, we need to be extremely careful and cognizant about avoiding unintended consequences which may increase patients\u2019 cost further and/or decrease patients\u2019 access to affordable and quality healthcare. We are really glad that the administration has called for a fact-based dialogue, we believe a discussion based on facts is a good thing.  It\u2019s too early to predict the impact of any potential new federal regulations, but it\u2019s an important issue we recognize that and we want to help lead to solutions. We know that it\u2019s our responsibility and we will continue to unite around efforts that address some of the most critical health and consumer needs of people around the world and as we consistently live up to these values, I am very proud and honored to share several industry recognitions for Johnson & Johnson as few months and it further underscore our commitment to make diversity and inclusion in every day behavior, create an open supportive and includes a professional environment where people can bring their whole selves to work, build a global diverse workforce for the future that consistently enhances our business performance and reputation and ensure that good health is within reach for every one everywhere. As a global healthcare leader, we operate the intersection of science, technology, speed and change which enables us to re-imagine tomorrow today. As leaders of this great company, we take that responsibility very seriously. We believe in a bright and successful future or virtually anything that can be imagined, can be accomplished through a laser like focus on innovation, execution, and our customers, which ultimately drives superior long-term performance.  And while we are focused on all of this, we also remain committed to fulfilling our credo responsibilities and striving to profoundly change the trajectory of Health For Humanity.  Thank you for your time, interest, engagement and continued support. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I will now turn the call back over to Joe who\u2019ll provide more insight on our results for the second quarter, as well as additional commentary about our guidance for the remainder of the year.  Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thanks, Alex. Since sales have been addressed, I\u2019ll comment on second quarter results related to cash, the P&L and then guidance for 2018.  At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, which consists of approximately $18 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt.  Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2018, if you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 second quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.8 billion on an after-tax basis, the largest of which is intangible amortization.  Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $2.10 exceeding the mean of analyst estimates. This is an increase of 14.8% versus the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.04, up 11.5% versus the second quarter of 2017.  Highlighting a few items on the items on the statement of earnings, gross profit for the quarter decreased by 230 basis points, primarily driven by intangible asset amortization from the Actelion acquisition partially offset by segment mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were lower as compared to the second quarter of 2017 by 60 basis points due to leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business partially offset by investments in Consumer and Medical Devices businesses in support of new product launches. As you heard from Alex, we prioritize funding for innovation.  Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.7%, which is higher than the second quarter 2017 as we continue to advance and enhance our pipeline. Other income and expense was a net expense of $364 million in the quarter compared to net expense of $527 million in the same period last year.  Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was relatively flat with a net gain of $461 million in 2018, compared to a net gain of $434 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.5% compared to 20.2% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The 18.5% rate for the second quarter is the result of current interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, specifically relating to new provisions taxing international income.  We anticipate the U.S. Treasury to issue regulations later this year. These anticipated regulations are reflected in our tax rate guidance, which I will provide shortly.  Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 27.8% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to acquisitions and new product launches.  Pharmaceutical margins declined by a 130 basis points to 43.2%, driven by lower other income. Consumer margins improved to 25.7% due to divestiture gains, partially offset by an increase in brand marketing investments.  Let me now share some perspectives for you to consider as you refine your financial models for 2018. Our sales guidance for 2018 continues to include the impact of biosimilars and generics for REMICADE, PROCRIT and TRACLEER. However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA.  As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. It\u2019s just the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.  For the full year 2018, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales of 4.5% to 5.5% for the year, an increase over our previous guidance. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79.9 billion to $80.7 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 3.5% and 4.5% for the year which is also an increase to our previous guidance. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro as of last week at $1.17, for the balance of the year, the positive impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 0.8%.  This is below the rate of $1.23 which we utilized in our previous guidance and results in a 120 basis point reduction. Thus, under this scenario, we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 5.3% to 6.3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance solely due to the change in currency.  Factors for you to consider for the balance of this year are the acceleration of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses, as well as the impact of generics and biosimilars that I\u2019ve mentioned. And tougher comparisons on the Pharmaceutical segment as this current wave of above market growth began in the third quarter of last year.  Our pre-tax operating margin guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect to improve our pre-tax operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. For purposes of your models, and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $500 million and $600 million.  This is lower than previous guidance as we benefit from an increase in interest income from higher rates. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.  We would be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion which is consistent with our previous guidance.  Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximately 17% to 18%, which is a tightening of the range related to our prior guidance.  Taking all of this into consideration, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.92 to $8.02 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operation or constant currency growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.9%, which is higher than our previous guidance and reflects a tightening of the range due to the underlying strength of the business. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at $1.17, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share which is lower than our previous guidance of $0.20 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.07 to $8.17 per share reflecting growth of approximately 11.2% at the midpoint.  So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter results and remain confident about the strength of our business. Our underlying sales growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures is projected to be approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, an acceleration from 2017 and an increase of 1% over our guidance at the start of this year.  Consistent with our principle to grow earnings faster than sales, our guidance for reported adjusted EPS growth is 10.5% to 11.9% or 11.2% at the midpoint. This is an increase of the midpoint versus previous guidance incorporating strong operational performance, partially offset by the impact of the strengthening dollar. We are confident in our performance not just for the balance of this year, but beyond.  I will now turn things back over to Matt o open up the Q&A portion of the call. Matthew Stuckley : Great. Thank you, Joe and thank you, Alex. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of today\u2019s discussion. Rob, can you please provide Q&A instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with one on the guidance and then one on Pharma. So the first half organic growth, it was about 5.3% excluding the acquisitions, divestitures and currencies and I think the guidance this morning implied second half organic growth of about 2.5%.  So, my questions are as follows : what else besides the comps is leading to the slower second half expected growth? And where are you expecting directionally for each of the three divisions in the second half versus the first half?  And then, I'll put as my second question here on pharma now, so ZYTIGA in the U.S. has been driving a lot of your growth in Pharma. How confident are you that you can continue to drive above market growth in Pharma in 2019, if you lose exclusivity for ZYTIGA later this year? Thanks for taking the questions. Alex Gorsky : Good morning, Larry. Good to hear from you. Let me take the second question first. With respect to ZYTIGA, if you look at the strong quarter that the Pharmaceutical unit had, let\u2019s remove that growth out and still about 8%, well above any market comparator. So the portfolio is strong. You look at the uptake of TREMFYA, STELARA for Crohn\u2019s our growth is coming from multiple sources. So why we are very pleased with ZYTIGA\u2019s performance it\u2019s \u2013 we are not dependent upon it.  With respect to the guidance, so we have raised the operational growth to the midpoint of five. There is some things that I think that need to be pointed out with respect to the second half. I want to state upfront though we do expect to grow in the second half in our pharmaceutical unit as well as accelerate as you heard at our Analyst Day for Medical Devices and Consumer, as a matter of fact I think you saw a positive, if not modest step in this quarter with respect to Medical Devices. But the comps are pretty significant year-on-year. If you look at the second half of last year where we had really I would call it, this new wave of above market growth for the pharmaceutical unit, it was dependent upon STELARA doing so well in Crohn\u2019s, the launch of TREMFYA, the LATITUDE data came out for ZYTIGA.  The way we looked at it was, the first half growth of this year compared to the second half of last year was about 4% - 4% to 5%. We expect that business to continue to grow going forward and again with the other sectors kicking in as well, we think it bodes pretty well for the entire year.  I would also say we are likely to see a little bit more pronounced effect from generics in the back half of this year. So PROCRIT CONCERTA and obviously TRACLEER in the U.S. So those are the some of the things that I would consider as you look out for the balance of this year. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you for taking the questions. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Alex, I have two medical device questions for you. First, toward the tail-end of the device, meaning, you made the comment about mid-size to larger medical device acquisitions and you commented that if the opportunity was there and it felt right that\u2019s something that you would consider.  So, Alex, I am wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on that comment from the medical device day in light of maintaining the Triple A rating in light of over $30 billion of debt on the balance sheet and in light of a new head of medical devices. And can you quantify what mid-size to large means to you?  And then, lastly, on medical device strategy, given the fact that you do have a new head of medical devices. Does anything change in the near-term and what I am referring to, it seems like Sandy\u2019s strategy to accelerate growth was a function of divesting slow growth businesses and doing tuck-in deals. So should we assume that strategy is maintained in the near-term? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Glenn. Thank you very much for your question and look, before I answer both of them, let me also just reiterate some of Joe\u2019s earlier comments and congratulate our business leaders, I believe for producing results this quarter that were very strong and very consistent with a lot of the strategic goals that we had set in place and that we discussed over the past several years. It started with our Pharmaceutical sector, but even the increased performance I think we saw underlying in Medical Devices, particularly in Vision Care and hospital medical devices, and what we clearly have got work to do in Consumer, we believe we got strong reasons to believe in the back-end of the year given some of the launches that we will be focusing on as well as other areas of improved execution that we\u2019ll see that delivering at and above market growth rate. So, I just want to thank all of our employees for making those possible.  Now as it relates to Medical Devices, Glenn, consistent with comments that I\u2019ve frequently made in the past, we remain very interested in value creating inorganic growth opportunities in Medical Devices. We are quite excited about the 15 to 20 launches that we have in place for this year and over the past couple of years, I think what we\u2019ve seen is an uptick in the number of bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019ve done.  In fact, just last year, we invested more than $1 billion in our Medical Device group giving us good new technologies, really across almost all of our major platforms. And of course, with our very strong balance sheet, it also gives us the flexibility to continue to invest going forward.  I won\u2019t comment specifically on exactly what size or obviously what companies, but when we think that the strategy is right, that it fits with our portfolio, that we feel that ultimately we can actually create value, based upon the asset and operationalize it and execute, we are ready to do so.  Regarding the overall strategy of the Medical Device unit, given the change in leadership, I would like to again thank Sandy for her leadership and for what she contributed, really not only in Medical Devices, but across the other areas of our business, but also welcome Ashley who is really a seasoned Johnson & Johnson leader with extensive experience in medical devices really for about the past eight years both in our ETHICON, as well as our Vision Care business where she led a very significant turnaround.  But we believe that the underlying strategies of focusing on innovation, i.e. increasing the amount of launches and also bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, we expect that to continue and improved focus on execution which has been in place over the last 12 months. But we\u2019ll continue going forward and we think that we are seeing the early signs that in fact that strategy and that plan is paying off as you saw our HMD growth rate of just about 3.5% for this quarter and you saw Vision Care continue to grow at an overall rate of about 9%.  So, that\u2019s the way that I would look at it and thank you very much for your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Hi, thank you. Alex, and this is a question for you as well, Joe I\u2019d love views on this. Corporate simplification is clearly getting rewarded on Wall Street and JNJ has certainly participated in this strategy by selling underperforming businesses.  But investors have actually rewarded much bigger steps to reshape portfolios, most recently Novartis announced decision to spin Alcon, GE's decision to spin its healthcare business, obviously we have seen massive long-term outperformance in both AbbVie and Zoetis, which were spin outs. You have been consistent in your view that your credo 75 years old now embraces a conglomerate structure.  But just wondering if there is an appetite internally now with a new CFO in place and with the recent underperformance of the stock to rethink the conglomerate structure after 75 years is it time to tweak this credo? Thanks. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Jami, thank you very much for your question. And look, what I would say is, we are always challenging our internal strategy and as you and I have talked about in the past that, our diversified strategy is not predicated upon our 130 plus year history, but it\u2019s really predicated upon our excitement and our outlook for overall healthcare and our performance going forward.  As it relates to some of the recent transactions across the business, what I would say here too, if you look out over a 25, or 10 or 15 or five or three or even a two year overall performance, what you\u2019ll see is that Johnson & Johnson has outperformed and we really manage the business with that kind of a long-term outlook.  I think you\u2019ve also seen that over the past several years, we\u2019ve been much more disciplined and focused on pruning our portfolio in appropriate places where frankly we didn\u2019t feel that we saw significant growth opportunities or perhaps where good companies, good product lines were better suited in someone else\u2019s hands as we continue to invest in more promising areas and we will continue to evaluate those kind of strategies and on our model and on our approach going forward. Thank you very much. Joseph Wolk : Jami, the only other thing I might add to that and maybe emphasizes Alex\u2019s point is that, we are performance-based. So, while our heritage may say we were constructed a certain way if we don\u2019t perform and we don\u2019t have the same, I would say strategies that we are executing upon in terms of being leaders in the markets in which we play driving earnings a little bit faster than the top-line growth and then having the capital allocation priorities that you become very familiar with, we would challenge that.  And so, the nice thing about the transition between Dominic and I is that there doesn\u2019t need to be an upheaval of policies or company protocol because the performance is borne out that it\u2019s certainly is very strong and it works. Jami Rubin : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, couple on REMICADE if I could. Just it looks like it\u2019s about a 16% decline in the first quarter if we excluded those one-time impacts and about 14% this quarter in the U.S. Is there any sort of sequential changes you are expecting either on price or otherwise as we think about the second half of the year or moving into 2019, just so we can kind of project obviously that very important product.  And then the latest thing we can share on the lawsuit that Pfizer and others have filed against you guys on some of your contracting strategies, I think we are waiting for the judge to go on a motion for dismissal. Can you just give us a sense of when we expect to hear back from the judge and if the case goes forward, when do you think we may ultimately have a decision? Alex Gorsky : Yes, so, with respect to REMICADE performance, yes, I think this quarter it was 14%, 16% adjusted in the first quarter. So, we don\u2019t see any step change from this point out to the balance of the year, what I would say is maybe you might see a little bit of increased discounts as contracts come for renewal at the beginning of the next year and there will be some accrual effect obviously in the fourth quarter for that product, but nothing significant.  We still maintain about 94% of the Infliximab volume share. Regarding the lawsuit which we believe is baseless in its merits. There is really no update on that. So, we\u2019ll wait and see, but it\u2019s not something that concerns us giving the contracting practices that we employ and how that is on par with others in the industry. Vamil Divan : Okay, thanks. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Vamil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Maybe one quick one for Alex and maybe two quicks for Joe. Alex, just coming back to the management changes, if I could. So, we all know Pharma has been the historic value driver for the business and I guess, by promoting two pharmaceutical executives to Vice Chairman, is it fair that investors would conclude your management sees Pharma as the driver or the primary driver of shareholder value creation on a go-forward basis? Why would that be an inappropriate conclusion? And then, two quick ones for Joe. Alex Gorsky : Sure, David. Thank you very much. I don\u2019t think that would be inappropriate conclusion to draw and what I would say is that, first of all, I would like to recognize and congratulate the great performance and frankly the significant value that\u2019s been created under the leadership of Paul and Joaquin and their leadership of our Pharmaceutical business.  But I think it\u2019s also important to note that, look these are very broad seasoned leaders with more than three decades of experience and for the past several years, Paul was playing a critical role in our Pharmaceutical business. He is also taking an increasingly more active role across our R&D portfolio.  And so, we look forward to having him continue to accelerate the value of our future pipeline and frankly the level of science and innovation that we have across Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin too is a very experienced leader who did have some experience outside, actually in the Medical Device area. But he is somebody who has a \u2013 again a long track record of leading through complex, challenging issues and significant opportunities.  So by expanding his role, we think the impact that he can have in working with Jorge in our Consumer group, as well as with our information technology or supply chain and other areas will be very positive. I think the other important issue here, David is that, with Ashley\u2019s promotion, Ashley will continue to report into me and will reporting to me in her new role, maintaining responsibility for Vision Care.  So, given her previous experience in Medical Devices, given my experience in Medical Devices, this will allow us to continue to manage our entire portfolio of businesses with the very strong leaders across Johnson & Johnson. And by the way I\u2019d also be remised if I didn\u2019t recognize Jennifer Taubert who will now \u2013 is now leading our Pharmaceutical business. Again, a very experienced seasoned leader who has been a big part of our Pharmaceutical growth over the past several years and we really look forward to seeing her upcoming contributions going forward. David Lewis : Okay. Thanks, Alex. Very clear. Then Joe, just two quick ones for me. The first is, so that the first time I think you called out procedure growth as a driver of the AF business at quite some time. I wonder you see early benefits from the CABANA trial and then just a follow-up on Actelion, I think that business was a slight decline for first quarter, can you just update us on the growth rate of Actelion and you gave us the pieces, but the overall growth rate in the second quarter. Thanks so much. Joseph Wolk : Sure. Thanks, David. So, on CABANA, I think that could have a benefit to the market. It\u2019s probably still too early to make that determination that that\u2019s driving additional procedures at this point. With respect to Actelion, I believe if you look at the entire portfolio and it gets a little tricky because we had a minor divestiture there.  But I think it was up about 2% where we are really focused on there as you know though is, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI where they grew very, very healthy double-digits for the quarter and again, as I noted in some of the prepared remarks, the dynamic of the patient assistance foundations does not seem to be an overhang. Thanks for the questions, David. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Simply there are two. In Medical Devices, you pointed out that extra day added a percentage to growth. Is there anything else either in devices, pharma or consumer that needs to be called out that may have helped stocking, particular campaigns or et cetera? Alex Gorsky : No, I think this was a fairly clean quarter with respect to that. There was some selling days in Medical Devices, primarily in the orthopedics side of things that we called out in Q1, which was a hurt it comes back as a help this quarter and then some of the factors in consumer which depressed the reported results which we should see come back to us in the back half of this year. But nothing around gross to net anything of that nature, Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : That\u2019s helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I appreciate the progress made in Spine and in Knees sequentially, but they are still struggling. And those are markets that are even on a good day or probably growing 1% to 2%. How do we think about them really being additive to the total organization? And how long does it takes to go from a negative growth rate to even the market growth rate? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Joanne, thank you very much for your question. And, look, we have been disappointed with the performance of both of those segments. However, we are confident going forward and let me just take each. If we look at our underlying Knee business, even just on a sequential basis from first quarter to second quarter, we are seeing underlying improvement. We believe that that\u2019s being driven by the launch of the ATTUNE revision and as well as the extended tibial plate. We\u2019ve got other launches regarding the cementless planned in the future and look for data around ATTUNE whether it\u2019s from UK, Australia, New Zealand or the Michigan registries remains strong and frankly we put a greater focus on execution with our sales force that we believe will continue to see a positive turnaround in that aspect of our business in the back-end of this year.  As you know with Spine, that\u2019s been a longer-term issue. It\u2019s been a \u2013 frankly, we believe a market-driven issue to a very large degree albeit we have had some dislocation and complexity as we saw the Synthes and DePuy organizations come together that caused some challenge in our sales forces. And frankly, our innovation cadence slowed down there as well. I think we are now in a position where we put a much improved focus on stabilizing the sales organization. Two, we have \u2013 here is also a strong cadence of new launches with our interbody cage, with other type of guidance systems, as well as some additional nails, plates and screws and other systems that we think are also going to contribute to positive growth as we go through the back-end of 2018 and into 2019. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Sorry if I missed this, but just the first question is one of you could just comment on the impact on pricing, pure pricing on the pharma business in Q2 and more importantly, has your outlook for drug pricing for 2018 and beyond changed relative to the commentary that you made earlier in the year? Just looking for an update on this important topic. Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. So, yes, it is an important topic as Alex referred to in his comments. So, if you look at the STELAR results and Pharmaceuticals where we had a 11% adjusted operational growth. That was in light of a price decline of about \u2013 let me see here, it\u2019s about 2% for the quarter.  So it\u2019s been 4% year-to-date in terms of negative price, it\u2019s 2% for this quarter. We would expect that to be probably in the realm of about 4% to 6%, somewhere this year as we look over the back half of this year and given the results that we\u2019ve had in the first half. So, again, we continue to act responsibly in this way. As Alex referenced, our transparency report from last year indicated price down in the U.S. about 4.5%. You are looking at something similar this year. Alex Gorsky : Bob, what I would also just add there is that, I think it also just harkens back to the strong underlying volume increases that we are seeing across our portfolio, particularly in Oncology and immunology, but beyond that, our neuroscience group and cardiovascular has remained strong, as well as our infectious disease. So, again, on a very broad base, volume-driven, which means that ultimately we are reaching more patients around the world. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you for that color. And then just one quick follow-up on the trends in orthopedics. I was wondering if you could just clarify on the selling day part. Was that a global impact for orthopedics or is that \u2013 was that more of a impact in the U.S.? And then I am curious, was there any change in your view on kind of orthopedic market growth rates in Q2 versus Q1? Thank you very much. Joseph Wolk : Matt, do you want to take this one? Matthew Stuckley : Thanks, Joe. So, Bob, thanks for the question. The selling day impact that Joe quoted was global of about one point and that was pretty equal between both the U.S. and outside the U.S. I think as we look at overall Orthopedic market trends in Q2, relatively stable versus what we saw in Q1. I think in trauma is one in particular where we did see that market decline a little bit versus the growth that we saw in Q1. But overall, relatively consistent with the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a follow-up question on the Spine business. It\u2019s been pretty weak and it seems like the market is actually very weak. And J&J historically has done a lot of reevaluating businesses and getting out of slower growth businesses that no longer make sense.  Can you talk about whether this is even still a good market for J&J? Is this is a business just based on the recent performance that could be up for potential divestiture? And my next question, my follow-up there is, is this a market that might be moving in the direction of stem therapy ultimately and what J&J\u2019s views are there? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Danielle, thank you very much. And, look, what I would say overall is, we still believe that Spine is a large attractive global market. There is a lot of unmet need, because as we all know, as we get older, a lot of the existing technologies don\u2019t deliver the same level of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.  For example, that you might experience with the Hip or even in Knee replacement and look, while we are excited about the progress that we are making, and some of the strong cadence of launches and acquisitions, we clearly know that we have gotten more work to do at the performance of this business.  And the reason for that frankly is, the continued slowdown with Spine category growth, especially in the U.S. We had some portfolio gaps as I mentioned earlier that we are now closing. And we had sales force attrition in 2017, which did have a negative impact that we think that that is now stabilized.  So, while we still have got work to do, we maintain the number two position globally. We think that it\u2019s a very strong complement to the rest of our portfolio. But we are very, very focused on getting that business turned around and move it in the right direction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I have a few pharma questions. I got one for Joe and then a follow-up for Alex. So, Joe, on PAH, UPTRAVI hasn\u2019t beaten consensus really until this quarter. Was there something different in 2Q? And do you guys view this as a start of more sustained acceleration of the franchise? And there are several generics coming into the prostacyclin category this year, what are you guys\u2019 expectations on pricing or a step at it? Joseph Wolk : Yes. So, with regards to the performance in the quarter, beating consensus, that\u2019s probably less relevant for us. I know it\u2019s important for you guys. But what I would say, it\u2019s just probably the Patient Assistance Foundation, we are seeing obviously the impact of the broader reach that Johnson & Johnson has with respect to patient penetration.  Regarding generics coming in later this year, that\u2019s part of the guidance in which we\u2019ve provided. We\u2019ll see how that plays out and we\u2019ll just go from there. But that is part of our thinking going forward, Geoff. Geoff Meacham : Okay. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Geoff, this is Alex. The other thing that I might add is, look whenever you do this kind of an acquisition, there are certain elements in the transition that you got to work your way through and what I think part of what we are seeing frankly is now that we have several quarters under our belt that that team is really starting to come together. We are starting to realize the global selling synergies. I\u2019ve been particularly impressed with our medical affairs team and the way that we are looking at new opportunities to how do identify patients earlier? How do we start combination therapy earlier to actually help potentially stop the progression of the disease and combine with just general executional improvements that we see across the board that\u2019s why it makes us bullish on Actelion going forward. Geoff Meacham : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Alex, when you look at the segments within Pharma, obviously oncology is a standout for growth, but you have neuroscience and cardio metabolic that are laggers, when you make \u2013 you and the Board make capital allocation decisions, there is a breadth of Pharma growth really inform your strategy. I guess, I am trying to figure out how aggressive you want to be on the BD front and whether the categories within Pharma really matter? Alex Gorsky : Yes, look, overall Geoff, what I would say is, that we still believe there is a lot of opportunities across the \u2013 really now six different platforms that we have in our Pharmaceutical group and it starts basically with unmet need. I mean, if you look at some of the lower penetration rates and the new categories, for example, in immunology, you still see penetration rates and things like psoriatic, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis of only around 35%. And even in the novel oral anti-coagulant class, you still see WARFARIN at about a 45% share. So, there is a lot of opportunity that we focus on. I think the other issue for us is that by taking this portfolio approach, not only does it allow us to expand into new patient opportunities and obviously do a lot with the medical affairs investment with new indications, but it also enables us to do that in a fairly efficient manner. So that we don\u2019t have to re-create sales or marketing or reimbursement organizations, but rather it can be another option in the portfolio and frankly that\u2019s why now for example, if you look in immunology, STELARA is well on its way to becoming our number one product. But if you look TREMFYA, SIMPONI, even with the REMICADE decline in the phase of biosimilars our overall portfolio approach I think is in fact really working. Joseph Wolk : Hey, Geoff, maybe just to pick up on Alex\u2019s comment too, because you called out neuroscience specifically. The core brands there, the long-acting injectables are only penetrated to the tune of about 15%. We know that that\u2019s the best way to treat those types of patients and that portfolio of assets is performing extremely well. So the reported growth for that particular therapeutic area is impeded by CONCERTA and some declines in ULTRAM and older products. I would also point to the excitement we have around ESKETAMINE in that particular space. So, we think we\u2019ll be filing that very shortly here and certainly by the end of the year. It\u2019s a novel new treatment for patients suffering from depression. We know that\u2019s the number one cause of suicide here in the United States and globally. So, we think that\u2019s going to be a very healthy therapeutic area for us going forward. Alex Gorsky : Yes, Geoff, just to tag on to that, our underlying LAI business in neuroscience is growing at about 12%. We think that category is less than 12% penetrated. And Joe is exactly right. If you look at the unmet need in the area of treatment resistant depression and frankly the what the data suggests with the potential for ESKETAMINE, we couldn\u2019t be more excited for patients or for our business going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of device related questions and perhaps I missed this. But on the 15 to 20 new product launches in 2018, how many of that you launched already? And then my second question is just on the margin profile on devices, the business is generating 30 plus percent margins over the last couple of years. We have now changed two straight quarters of sub-30% margins. I realize there is a lot of moving parts in this number, but curious as to the source of margin softness. Is it a function of increased R&D investment? Is gross margin little softer? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Joseph Wolk : Yes, so with respect to the new products that we\u2019ve launched in Medical Devices, I would say, we are probably about 60% of the way there at this point. Some of these are staggered launches. If you look at the ATTUNE revision, we launched fully here in the U.S. and then it\u2019s going to proceed globally. But I would say we are about 60% of the way in meeting that commitment for 2018. With respect to margin comparisons year-on-year, I would think that\u2019s going to be related to primarily other income and a lack of divestiture gains that were recognized in the first half of last year versus what we\u2019ve recognized this year. In terms of R&D investments, I would say that\u2019s up slightly. We are one of the highest investors in terms of absolute dollars in the medical device space and gross margin continues to improve from an operational perspective. There is a little bit of a headwind with the price obviously, but in terms of our supply chain as we announced last quarter, we continue to make refinements there to keep our costs highly competitive to provide patients and hospital systems with greater affordable access. Jayson Bedford : Thanks, Joe. Joseph Wolk : You are welcome, Jayson. Matthew Stuckley : Thanks for the question Jayson. Rob, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes. Your next question is coming from the line of Rick Weiss with Stifel. Rick Weiss : Good morning. Good morning, Alex. Hi, Joe. Alex Gorsky : Good morning. Rick Weiss : Just, I just had one question. Really this morning we had \u2013 lot of mine has been answered. On the \u2013 on Slide 22, you had talked about the Medical Device portfolio and growth strategy, Alex, you highlight the notion that you are focused on maximizing new market growth opportunities and sites of care beyond the hospitals. Not a big deal probably, but, are you looking at sites of care beyond the hospitals just simply trends shifting to MHR surgical centers, is there is something more substantial here that you can do or thinking about really the home health, digital health, other new initiatives. Just any color would be very interesting to hear? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Rick. Thanks for the question. And the short answer is, yes. But, in particular, in a lot of our conversations and discussions with hospital systems, as they are trying to navigate their way to the challenges that they are seeing in the current marketplace, clearly they are dealing with shifts in care from the traditional hospital operating room to the ambulatory care center, trying to do a better job of managing both pre-operative as well as post-operative care. And those are all areas that frankly we think are exciting not only in terms of the business opportunity but also in terms of a better position overall for Johnson & Johnson and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Rick Weiss : Thank you so much, Alex. Alex Gorsky : Thank you. Matthew Stuckley : Thank you for the question, Rick and thanks everyone who asked the question today and apologies to those who we could not get to in time. However, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team needed with any follow-ups. I will now turn the call back to Alex for some closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : Sure. Well, thank you very much for your continued confidence and support in Johnson & Johnson. I think you\u2019ll agree with me that we had a very strong quarter that\u2019s quite consistent with the plans that we\u2019ve been laying out. As expected, we have some areas that we are particularly strong, others that we need to continue to focus on and improve. But overall, we are pleased with the progress that we are making and again, we appreciate your continued support. So, on behalf of the more than 130,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world, who wake up every day trying to help patients and consumers with a longer, healthier and happier lives in a credo-based way. Thank you very much and I will look forward to catching up with you later in the year. Bye for now. Operator : Thank you.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Hello. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the investor conference call to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the third quarter of 2018. I am pleased to be joined for a discussion today by Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide commentary on the quarter\u2019s financial performance along with an update on our guidance for 2018. Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to be joined by the leaders of our business segments who will participate in our Q&A session. Joining me today in New Brunswick are Jorge Mesquita, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; we also via phone, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson and joining us on today\u2019s call. Our strong third quarter results included areas of strength across all segments of our business. Consumer\u2019s operational growth accelerated across all franchises and all major regions in our portfolio and also benefitted from the relaunch of our iconic Johnson\u2019s Baby brand in the U.S.  Our Pharmaceutical business demonstrated strong, above-market growth, fueled by multiple innovative products. We continue to successfully navigate overall market dynamics and are confident in our proven business model to enable us to deliver sustainable growth. Medical Devices continues to enhance market-leading positions in many key platforms and delivered improved performance across more platforms than prior quarters to deliver on our goal of above-market performance in 2020. Specifically, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, we saw another quarter of improved growth in hospital Medical Devices with almost a full point improvement versus the second quarter of 2018. As in enterprise, we continue to exceed near-term financial expectations, while managing the business for the long term to benefit patients, customers and shareholders. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There, you can also find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules. Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today\u2019s discussion, as well as the Company\u2019s Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today\u2019s discussion to the most comparable GAAP measure are all available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 75 minutes. Now, I\u2019m pleased to share our results for the quarter. Worldwide sales were $20.3 billion for the third quarter of 2018, a 3.6% increase versus the third quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.5% as currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. In the U.S., sales were up 3.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.5% with the effect of currency exchange rates reducing our reported OUS results by 4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.5% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment. With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $3.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.05, representing increases of 7.3% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.5%. Joe will discuss earnings further in his remarks. Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items to build upon the slides that will be presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages reference represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2017, or in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide Consumer sales totaled $3.4 billion, growing 4.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the Compeed business in the Wound Care/Other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide. Performance in the quarter was positively impacted by the restocking of retail inventory to support the relaunch of our Johnson\u2019s Baby portfolio in the U.S. that we highlighted last quarter. Excluding this impact, our adjusted operational growth was approximately 5.4%, representing above-market growth for our Consumer segment this quarter. Beauty led the Consumer segment performance growing 6.5% or just above 8% when adjusting for divestitures, primarily Nizoral. The U.S. realized strong category consumption and growth including continued strong performance in e-commerce. The NEUTROGENA brand delivered strong results, primarily reflecting growth in facial moisturizing and share gains in sun protection. Additionally, the OGX and Maui Moisture brands delivered strong performance, growing share globally. Results outside the U.S. were also driven by the Asia Pacific region where Dr.Ci:Labo and NEUTROGENA brands had strong uptake. OTC also delivered strong results, growing 6.8%, or slightly above 6% adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, mainly our recent acquisition of Zarbee\u2019s. In the U.S., we grew overall category market share by 0.6 points versus prior year with strong consumption across many key categories such as upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC for allergy relief, IMODIUM for digestive health, and TYLENOL, and MOTRIN in analgesics. We also deliver strong growth outside of the U.S. across our portfolio, led by performance in antismoking aids, driven by new product innovation. As previously referenced, we successfully relaunched our Johnson\u2019s Baby product line and achieved growth of 4.3% this quarter. Excluding the benefit of the retail inventory restocking, the business was essentially flat versus prior year. While it is early, we\u2019re excited about the progress of the relaunch as we realized strong consumption in the month of September. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.3 billion grew 8.2% with double-digit growth in nine key products, resulting in continued above-market performance. The segment was led by performance of the oncology portfolio, growing about 39% globally. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing globally by approximately 60%. In the U.S., market growth and strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries where it is commercially available as well as in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region where it gained approval late last year. This strong broad-based volume growth was partially offset by a onetime adjustment outside the U.S. related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement matters, which negatively impacted worldwide DARZALEX growth by 16 points. IMBRUVICA grew approximately 40% globally with growth in the U.S. of 45%. Based on second quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 3 points of market share versus prior year, across all lines of therapy, largely driven by share in line one Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or CLL. The CLL line one market is estimated to have grown approximately 14% in the same period. ZYTIGA grew approximately 45% due to continued strong market growth and share gains, primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA with the penetration of prescribers split evenly among neurology and oncology practices. In immunology, we delivered global sales growth of 5%, driven by continued strong performance in STELARA of 17% and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA of approximately 15% offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to competition from biosimilars. REMICADE has maintained approximately 93% of the infliximab volume share. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn\u2019s disease where market share has increased approximately 7 points compared to the third quarter of 2017. Lastly, sales of our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA totaled $171 million globally. TREMFYA is experiencing strong demand with over 25,000 patients on therapy and achieved a 5.8% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S. In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio delivered strong global growth of approximately 18%, driven by new patient starts and persistency. We did experience negative growth in our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA. Additionally, XARELTO declined by 3.6% with continued share growth being offset by increased rebates including approximately 6 points of a negative impact from prior quarter adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, XARELTO\u2019s underlying growth would have been approximately 2.5%. Subsequent to the quarter, the U.S. FDA approved XARELTO for a new 2.5 milligram vascular dose, making XARELTO the first and only Factor Xa inhibitor to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke in people with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease. This indication significantly increases XARELTO\u2019s treatable patient population by approximately 13 million patients in the U.S. In pulmonary hypertension, we realized strong growth in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. OPSUMIT grew globally approximately 21% with similar growth, both inside and outside the U.S., and UPTRAVI grew 38% globally, both driven by further market penetration and increased share. As expected TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year. I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 1.7%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neuroscience, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9% worldwide. This growth represents an acceleration versus the first half of 2018. We continue to strengthen our market leading positions in our electrophysiology and vision businesses while also improving performance in spine and keens and our orthopedics portfolio. Growth is partially offset by declines in our diabetes care business. Subsequent to the quarter, we announced the completion of the divestiture of our LifeScan business, which is consistent with our approach to strategic portfolio optimization. Interventional Solutions grew 19.4% globally with continued strength in our electrophysiology business, which grew more than 23% worldwide, fueled by our market leadership position in the space from newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. This represents the highest growth that we realized in any quarter over the last nine plus years of double-digit growth. Additionally, we realized strong double-digit growth in our Cerenovus business, fueled by new product innovation, including the launch of EMBOTRAP for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Moving to our vision business. The contact lens business continued to grow above market at 6.2% worldwide on the strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS family. In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 4.1% was driven by international intraocular lens growth in cataracts. In orthopedics, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestitures of Codman Neuroscience and Prodisc in spine, performance was flat to third quarter 2017. In hips, we grew market share, leveraging our leadership position in the anterior approach, and continue to see strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS. Trauma was flat due to the lower market growth along with continued pricing pressure in the U.S. market. As the clear market leader in this segment, we continue to see strong adoption of newer innovation such as our TFNA Femoral Nail. Performance improved in both spine and knees, although we are committed to doing better. Spine performance improved for the third straight quarter, driven by new products such as the Concorde Lift Expandable Interbody implant and the Viper Prime system for minimally invasive surgery. Our performance in knees accelerated to approximately 1% growth due to the continued strong uptake of ATTUNE revision system and aided by the onetime impact of price legislation in India in 2017. Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 6% in spine, negative 3.5% in hips, negative 2.5% in knees and negative 2% in trauma. We were very pleased with the results for the surgery group. The advanced surgery performance with strong, led by double-digit growth outside the U.S. On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 10% and energy grew 4.5% as new products are experiencing strong demand, especially outside the U.S. Biosurgery grew over 9%, driven by strong demand, fueled by new innovation such as SURGICEL powder. In general surgery, wound closure grew 3.5% with growth in all regions as barbed and plus sutures are experiencing strong adoption. Selling days had a negligible impact on Medical Devices in Q3. And as previously communicated, we don\u2019t expect a material impact globally for the remainder of this year, but there could be some variances by region. As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the second quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in hospital admissions of about 1.5%, surgical procedures were up approximately 1% and lab procedures were up about 2%. Our preliminary estimates for the third quarter indicate a modest decline in hospital admissions growth to 1% with surgical procedures and lab procedures growth consistent with the second quarter at approximately 1% and 2%, respectively. That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 third quarter. For your reference, this slide summarizes notable developments that occurred in the third quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Wolk, who will provide further insights on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s quarterly financial results. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Chris. It is great to have you in the Investor Relations role. Good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter results, a product of the effort and the contributions made by our Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Our performance reflects the progress we\u2019re making against the robust strategies and plans that we have put in place across all three segments and that we\u2019ve been sharing with you throughout 2018. I\u2019d also like to welcome Ashley, Jorge and Jennifer to today\u2019s call. These are performance-based leaders who embody our credo-based culture. We all look forward to answering your questions about our business later in the call. Since Chris already provided many details on sales, I\u2019ll provide only a brief few comments on revenue before focusing the discussion on cash, the income statement and guidance for the remainder of 2018. In Consumer, we\u2019re very encouraged by the third quarter results, which are consistent with our plan to deliver above-market performance in the year that we shared at Analyst Day. Over-the-counter medicines and beauty continued to thrive, and we are very pleased with the early positive feedback related to our Johnson\u2019s Baby relaunch. We launched in the United States, China and India during the quarter, and we plan to continue the full global rollout into 2019. Our Medical Devices performance is also consistent with our Analyst Day plans. The third quarter reflected accelerated strength in already strong franchises such as electrophysiology, biosurgery and endocutters, and improvement in areas that underperformed in recent quarters, most notably spine and knees. The third quarter is a positive step toward our goal of returning to above-market performance by 2020. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to be an industry leader across many performance measures, including sales growth, R&D productivity and commercial capabilities. While we\u2019ll face tougher comparisons in the Pharmaceuticals segment through the remainder of this year as well as biosimilar and generic competition, we are confident in the strength of our business. Our growth, as in prior quarters, is the result of our approach to innovation and delivering transformational products. Our growth continues to be driven by volume rather than price. Being broadly based in healthcare allows us to continue to seek opportunities and we can uniquely drive value through our cross-segment collaboration and external partnering. One example is in the managed care setting where we are combining our patient and provider insights, our behavioral science expertise and our human centered design methods to enable a health insurance customer and a retail customer to collectively deliver a better experience for a priority patient population. This kind of collaboration is indicative of how we live into our credo and our commitment to ensure that good health is within reach for everyone everywhere. We will continue to use our broad base to provide new solutions in healthcare and meet the needs of patients and consumers, globally. Starting with cash, I will now highlight other key financial activity for this quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $12 billion of net debt which consists of approximately $19 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $31 billion of debt. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2018, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 third quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.7 billion on an after tax basis, driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion and an in-process R&D charge of $900 million, which is primarily related to the partial write-down of Alios Biopharma, as noted in this morning\u2019s press release. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.05, exceeding the mean of analyst estimates and an increase of 7.9% versus the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.08, up 9.5% versus the third quarter of 2017. I\u2019d like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed in the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin for the quarter improved by 280 basis points, primarily driven by favorable business mix as well as the impact of the Actelion inventory step-up charge recorded in 2017. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.3%, which is lower than the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the timing of investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $297 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was lower with a net gain of $32 million in 2018, compared to a net gain of $578 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the sale of the consumer Compeed business in the third quarter of last year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.6% compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full-year effective tax rate. The lower rate compared to the third quarter of last year is the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We anticipate the U.S. Treasury will issue further regulatory guidance later this year, specifically related to foreign tax credits and expense allocation against international income. Our tax rate guidance, which I will provide shortly, reflects these anticipated developments. Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise declined 20 basis points versus the third quarter of 2017. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices at 27.1% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to investments in the business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 380 basis points to 44.8%, driven by favorable product mix and timing of research and development spend. Consumer margins declined to 17.1% due to a prior year divestiture gain, previously mentioned, partially offset by investment spend. Turning to guidance for you to consider as you update your models. Our sales guidance for 2018 continues to include erosion due to the biosimilar competition impacting REMICADE, continued generic competition for CONCERTA and VELCADE, and the expected generic and biosimilar competition to TRACLEER and PROCRIT, later this year. Our guidance is based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is consistent with past guidance practice and the way we manage our business to provide the best understanding of our underlying performance. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. For the full-year 2018, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales of 5.5% to 6.0% for the year, an increase over the guidance we provided in July. This growth would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $80.6 billion to $81 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 4.5% and 5.0% for the year, also an increase to our previous guidance. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.15, the positive impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 0.5%. The trade is below previous guidance, which assumed a spot rate of 1.17 and results in a 30 basis-point reduction in growth, compared to that previous guidance. Therefore, under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 6.0% to 6.5% or approximately $81 billion to $81.4 billion. Again, this is higher than our previous guidance due to our operational strength. Our adjusted pretax operating margin guidance remains relatively unchanged. Although year-to-date performance suggests even greater improvement, we expect investments in the fourth quarter will result in the full-year pretax operating margin improvement of at least 150 basis points. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you to consider modeling net interest expense between $450 million and $500 million. This is lower than previous guidance as we benefit from an increase in interest income from higher rates. Regarding other income and expense. We would be comfortable with your 2018 models, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, which is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. This would include the gain associated with the divestiture of the LifeScan business announced subsequent to the quarter but does not include the divestiture of our Advanced Sterilization Products business, which we expect to close in 2019. Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximately 17.5% to 18.0%, reflecting a tightening of the previous range. Considering all these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.98 to $8.03 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 9% to 10%, which is higher than our previous guidance, again reflecting the strength of our business. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS will be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.13 to $8.18 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 11.8% at the midpoint, which is also higher than our previous guidance. That concludes our financial summary. I will now turn the call back over to Chris for the Q&A portion of the call where again, I\u2019m very pleased to be joined by Ashley, Jorge and Jennifer. Chris? Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Joe. We will now move on to our Q&A portion of today\u2019s discussion. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : Sure. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Maybe a few questions. Because we have so many people on the call this morning, I\u2019ll be quick. Joe, I just want to start with financial for you and then one for Jennifer and one for Ashley. So, Joe, just the guidance you gave here for the year, I am sort of doing some net math here, it seems like margins for the fourth quarter are somewhere around the mid-20s, which is consistent with your historical spending into the fourth quarter. I just want to get a sanity check on that. And if you think about next year on other income, is it reasonable to expect other income levels in \u201819 similar to \u201818? And I have two quick follow-ups. Joe Wolk : Yes. So, good morning, David. Good to hear from you. I would say with our margins for the fourth quarter, I would stand by the guidance that we just gave. You might have noticed the slight tweak in language. We\u2019ve gone from approximately 150 basis points to at least 150 basis points. So, we\u2019ll plan to invest in the fourth quarter much as you\u2019ve seen in previous years. With respect to other income and expense, I prefer to hold off till January when we give you 2019 guidance. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve commented in the past for quite some time now that when we do see a lessening of other income on that line, we will adjust accordingly with our operating margins. David Lewis : Okay, very clear. And then, I\u2019ll ask my two questions here together. First for Jennifer. Just your growth ex ZYTIGA this quarter was around I think 6%. Is that a good way to think about 2019 Pharma growth? And can you just give us an update on where you\u2019re coming out on, whether the fourth quarter implies any impact from ZYTIGA? And then, just Ashley, and congrats by the way to both you on the new positions. But, the ortho basically was stable overall, but the U.S. knee franchise obviously remains under pressure. Can you just give us a sense of how much of this is ATTUNE perception issues versus robotics, and what\u2019s the pathway to recovery in U.S. knees? Thanks so much. Jennifer Taubert : Great. Let me start in there. Good morning, David. First of all, we\u2019re really pleased with our third quarter performance for the pharmaceuticals sector. So, the 8.2% operational growth, which is above the market and growth coming that\u2019s broadly based across the portfolio with nine key brands achieving double digit growth and very strong performance as we look across the globe. As you noted, if we actually remove ZYTIGA from that mix, our growth was 6.6% operationally, so really, really strong performance. And so, I think what ZYTIGA shows and demonstrates, while we\u2019re pleased with ZYTIGA, we\u2019re absolutely not dependent on it. As Joe indicated, we\u2019re not providing any guidance right now for 2019. And in previous sessions, we\u2019ve discussed sort of the process and the legal challenges that are underway. Right now, we\u2019re in the process of waiting for court ruling on ZYTIGA in our stay at the end of October, October 28, I believe. So, we\u2019re not going to make any speculations or predictions on that. In fact, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the Pharma performance overall and very, very broadly based throughout the portfolio. Ashley McEvoy : David, good morning. No, I think for knees, with quarter three, I think you saw a little bit of a stabilization in quarter three in North America versus quarter two. We expect that to improve as we continue the rollout of our ATTUNE revision, which has gotten a very healthy uptick. And as we launch the cementless program in 2019, and then progress our digital surgery offering in Orthotaxy following in 2020, obviously coupled with very strong commercial excellence. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just Joe, couple of follow-ups on David\u2019s questions earlier. So, I know you\u2019re not giving 2019 guidance until January. But, maybe you could help us think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about, some of the ones that people are interested in, specifically currency. We estimate, it\u2019s about 100 basis-point headwind right now. And REMICADE erosion, how that might compare in 2019 to 2018? And I had one follow up. Joe Wolk : Sure, Larry. Good morning. Good to speak with you. I think probably the best way for me to comment on currency is to say that we provide guidance on our operational performance and then just an estimate based on what the current spot rates are at the time. This year, it was much less of a tailwind than we thought when we were speaking with the investment community back in January, where we thought it would translate into about $1.5 billion of additional revenue reported. It\u2019s only turning out to be about 25% of that. But, we\u2019ve been able take up guidance based on just the solid operational strength of our underlying business. So, I won\u2019t comment, because it\u2019s just much too speculative as to what next year may hold with respect to a strengthening dollar. And your second question with respect to REMICADE, I would say that\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of step change. I think what you\u2019ve seen this year is roughly 18% in the U.S. with biosimilar erosion. We continue to compete there. Most of that erosion is related to price. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. Because we know that that\u2019s what patients and healthcare providers actually see as a product of most comfort. So, based on the safety and efficacy that we\u2019ve demonstrated for a number of years and across all indications, we feel pretty strong that it still has a very strong place in the market. And the good news, as we said before biosimilars launched is, the immunology portfolio with the expansion of the STELARA label as well as the introduction of TREMFYA, continues to grow in spite of REMICADE\u2019s erosion. Larry Biegelsen : And Joe, you grew organically about 6% year-to-date including about 6% in Q3. Can you walk us through what your guidance assumes for organic growth in Q4? I\u2019m getting to about 2% at the midpoint. And I\u2019m wondering why you\u2019re assuming such a deceleration, because you just help us bridge that. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Wolk : Sure. Thanks, Larry. I know I can count on you for a math question. So, let me give you some things to think about. Obviously, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but I realize we\u2019ve got three quarters into the year, so, it becomes somewhat of a plug. But, let me give you that the qualitative things to consider as you model Q4, which we think are somewhat temporary or fleeting in nature. We do expect Medical Devices to continue that modest improvement quarter-on-quarter, strengthening in areas where we\u2019re already strong and then improving some of those areas that have underperformed in recent quarters. We do think we\u2019ve turned the corner with Consumer. We want to see more data points with that. But, the growth that belies this quarter of 6% adjusted operational, there\u2019s a slight I would say downward revision for that given some of the baby stocking. But, you\u2019re still into the mid-5 range. We think that\u2019s going to continue because it\u2019s underpinned by the baby franchise being rolled out across the globe. We\u2019re seeing strong receptivity for those products here in the U.S., China and India. And then, OTCs and beauty, skincare continue to perform at 6% levels. With Pharmaceutical, you have some unique adjustments. I would say there\u2019s going to be some new generic and biosimilars entries with respect to TRACLEER and PROCRIT that we anticipate and is in our thinking for guidance in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll see continued erosion that wasn\u2019t around fourth quarter of last year, with respect to CONCERTA and VELCADE. We do have much higher comps with respect to Pharmaceutical business. As you know, in the second half of 2017 is really when that business reaccelerated its strength. And then lastly, there\u2019s a gross or net accrual that we\u2019ll be making related to 2019 activity. As we get ready for the New Year, we have inventory at wholesalers and we accrue on those rebates. And just given the size of our business and some of the contracts that we see coming through, we think that\u2019s going to be a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter here. Operator : The next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. Joe, I just have a big picture strategic question. J&J seems to be stuck in a pattern of Pharma outperforming but MD&D underperforming. And while you are starting to see evidence of improvement in certain pockets of that business, I think relative to your peer group, J&J\u2019s business has been a pretty visible underperformer. I was just wondering -- and this is sort of a narrative that we\u2019ve seen for many, many years now, are you satisfied with that narrative? And if not, what would it take to jumpstart that narrative and what would it take to jumpstart the MD&D business? Will it require a large scale transformative deal, which I think you\u2019ve somewhat alluded to, or is it more likely that you would stick to tuck-in deals? Is that the right way to look at it or do we just need to be patient and wait for new products to reach the market for that? I think your guidance is that this business would start to grow in line or better than the market by 2020. Just wondering if you could address that. And then, I have a follow-up question for the Pharma. Just if you exclude REMICADE, I\u2019m just curious if prices or rebates have changed much in the immunology franchise, just given how crowded that space has become. Thanks very much. Joe Wolk : Thanks for the question, Jamie. Well, I\u2019ll kick off the answer and then maybe kick it over to Ashley to talk a little bit more about the plans for going forward in Medical Devices. But, I would say, comparing us to the peer group in Med Devices can be little bit misleading. I don\u2019t know that anybody is at the breadth or scale that we have when you just look at the level of revenue. There is maybe one other competitor that\u2019s notable and we outperformed them. That being said, we are not satisfied with the performance in Medical Devices. We\u2019re seeing, improvements. Whether that\u2019s going to take a transformational deal or tuck in deal, we\u2019re looking at all of them across all segments of our businesses. We want to make sure it\u2019s a good strategic fit and that we can create value not just for the company but for shareholders going forward. Ashley, maybe you can comment on a few things that will continue this upward momentum that we started in Medical Devices. Ashley McEvoy : Jami, thanks for the question. And I guess I would offer ground on kind of where we come from and then clearly where we aim to be. And what we\u2019re fortunate to be is, in a very strong position with number two in med tech, and we have half of our platforms growing above the market, and we\u2019ve got very competitive profitability and very competitive free cash flow. So, what I\u2019d like to say, very strong purpose of what we do every day of helping people. So with that at our back, clearly we are very focused on flipping each of this platform that we\u2019re dissatisfied and have been underperforming the market. And our strategy to achieve this has really been through accelerating innovation. You heard us speak around 15 to 20 new products, and many of those are having very strong traction in the marketplace. I use examples like some of the spine innovations have been enabling some of that fine performance. I expect some of the innovations in the ATTUNE revision and getting metal-less will help us with knees. I expect some of the innovations that we\u2019re launching in energy and endocutters, particularly around like the ECHELON FLEX will help us. We\u2019ve also been doing a lot of different M&A deals. We\u2019ve done about 26 deals this year, 5 of them have been acquisitions, 10 equity investments, 2 of them are divestitures; 1, which will hit in quarter four, which is diabetes, the other one will be ASP, which is early 2019; and then, several other co-promotes. So, I think we are very focused on accelerating those platforms that are in fact growing above the market. We\u2019re aligned on that strength, treating the ones that are underperforming through innovation, M&A and commercial excellence. And obviously we\u2019re always looking at transformative M&A but we haven\u2019t modeled in any of that. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Ashley. And Jennifer, maybe you can address Jami\u2019s question regarding pricing at Pharmaceutical ex REMICADE. Jennifer Taubert : Yes. And I believe Jami\u2019s question also was fairly focusing on immunology as well. And so, we definitely are seeing continued pressure on pricing in immunology as both the payers are working to extract greater rebates and discounts, and also as there is increase in competition in the key categories. However, that being said, I think given our strategy with being a transformational medical innovator, the types of products that we\u2019re bringing forward, the data that we\u2019re bringing forward and the types of analytics and things that we\u2019re doing in partnering with customers, I think we\u2019re really well-positioned to continue to compete and to be able to succeed in the market. If you take a look at our products ex-REMICADE in the immunology category, we\u2019ve got very robust growth, taking a look at STELARA with that growth being led by our Crohn\u2019s indication; TREMFYA, which is really making significant inroads in psoriasis; and also SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA. And so, even if you include REMICADE, we\u2019re continuing to grow outside of that with the others, we\u2019ve got very robust growth. So, going back, our growth really has been driven largely by volume and expanding our reach and reaching greater number of patients. And I continue to believe that that\u2019s how we\u2019ll be driving our growth going forward. So, yes, market is heating up in terms of discounts and rebates, but I think that we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to continue to compete successfully. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just two here. Maybe first -- another one on drug pricing. I guess, as we look out to 2019, and now you have a bit more clarity on some of your contracting, should we expect any major shifts in price dynamics for your Pharma business next year, based on these conversations or should we think about really a similar dynamic that we saw in 2018? My second question was on DARZALEX. Sales were maybe bit below expectations. I think you mentioned some ex-U.S. price adjustments impacting results. So, just elaborate little bit more on the trends you\u2019re seeing with the product and what\u2019s specifically happening ex-U.S. on pricing? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Sure. So on the pricing front overall, I think as we look into 2019 and what we\u2019re seeing in the contract, I think that we\u2019re going to see a continued evolution in some of the categories where there are very high level of competitors. But, it\u2019ll be an evolution in pricing, not a revolution or a step change. But, it definitely continues to be an area of focus for the payers and in that heavily contracted categories. If we take a look at DARZALEX, so DARZALEX had very strong performance with 60% growth worldwide, sales nearly $500 million. And it was very strong, both based in the U.S. and ex-U.S. What you\u2019re referring to and what we had mentioned relating to ex-U.S.is that we did have a onetime adjustment related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement, and that negatively impacted the DARZALEX worldwide growthby 16 points. This is just a normal adjustment, as we negotiate with governments to get reimbursement in some of the ex-U.S.markets. And we see this as a normal course of business and really a onetime adjustment. But DARZALEXoverall is demonstrating very, very strong growth and another strong quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi. Good morning. Two questions for Jennifer on the pipeline. Two key drivers over the next couple years, ERLEADA which was just launched and then, ESKETAMINE, which you are hoping to launch in 2019. So, Jennifer, on ESKETAMINE, I just want to get your sense of confidence in FDA approval. I\u2019m really asking is, you did five Phase 3s, three were positive, I think two missed their primary endpoints, but nonetheless, very good safety data. So, what\u2019s your confidence in approval? And do you think we may need an FDA panel for ESKETAMINE? And then, on ERLEADA, I know you\u2019re not giving the actual sales numbers, but when we track IMS data, ERLEADA is off to a slightly slower start than we would have expected. So, maybe talk about your expectations for ERLEADA as well? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : So, for ESKETAMINE, we\u2019re really excited about ESKETAMINE\u2019s potential for treatment resistant depression and also hopefully in the future, major depressive disorder, and for those patients who are at imminent risk of suicidality. Both of those products -- or programs, excuse me, have FDA breakthrough designation, which represents the significant unmet medical need. We are really confident in the totality of our data across the ESKETAMINE program and what we have filed both with the U.S. authorities as well as the EMEA authorities. It\u2019s really difficult in these types of trials to prove success, as you know, as you take a look across the industry. And we believe that across the totality of our data, we\u2019ve got a very, very robust program and robust data and are hopeful and optimistic for approval. In terms of an FDA panel, I don\u2019t know if we have heard from the -- back from the agency yet, if we will have one or not. They are typically standard for first-in-class or a new mechanism. So, I think, our team is going to anticipate and prepare for one. And as soon as -- I don\u2019t know if we have the actual answer on that. But that would not be unusual in any respect. I think, the default is everyone gets a panel, unless the agency says no on that. And the other question was on ERLEADA. So we have launched ERLEADA in the U.S. I believe we\u2019re not yet reporting sales on that in terms of numbers. We\u2019re pleased with the uptake. As you know with ERLEADA, this is in the pre-metastatic setting. So, it\u2019s in the earlier course of disease, both urologists and oncologists prescribe for it. There is very strong, both awareness and receptivity to the profile, the data and the label. And so, there is very strong interest in prescribing. But, we didn\u2019t anticipate -- you wouldn\u2019t anticipate to see the same type of uptake that you would in a later line of therapy. You really need to look at this as more of a chronic type of therapy with a chronic uptake ramp. But, what we\u2019ve seen today in terms of that provider and patient receptivity and uptake, we have been very pleased with ERLEADA. And we\u2019re also looking forward to data hopefully coming soon or early in 2019 in combination with ZYTIGA data as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you very much for taking the questions. In no particular order, Vision Care, up 6.2%, growing faster than the market, could you please discuss if there is any stocking or onetime items in that and how do you see Johnson & Johnson going forward in terms of product pipeline? If I can just continue quickly. Orthopedic pricing was a little bit worse sequentially about 50 basis points. Is that just normal gyration or is there anything that we need to think about that? And then, a follow-up to David\u2019s question. How much do you think the lack of a robot in your orthopedic franchise is holding that back? Ashley McEvoy : I guess, I\u2019ll start with your first question related to vision. So, Chris mentioned the performance in vision, and it really continues in contact lens. It\u2019s like the 13th quarter that we\u2019ve outperformed the market. Underlying growth in contact lenses remains around 7%, very consistent with the first half. I don\u2019t expect, to Chris\u2019s earlier point, a lot of additional selling days or any stocking events in Q3. As it relates to the pipeline, I think that they have a healthy cadence. We mentioned the global rollout of OASYS 1-Dat for astigmatism. We are preparing for the right management launch of a contact lens which automatically adjusts from outdoor light to indoor light and also preparing within the next 24 months for our allergy lens. So, I think there\u2019s a healthy cadence there in vision. I believe your question on orthopedics, if you could repeat, Joanne, your question on orthopedics? Joanne Wuensch : Of course. Thank you for taking my speed questions. It looks like pricing is about 50 basis points worse across the board, this quarter versus last quarter, and I just didn\u2019t know if I should read anything into that. Jennifer Taubert : I think what we referenced earlier with Chris is spine is a little bit softer than some of the other joint businesses; hips and knees are pretty consistent at that 2% to 3%. And we don\u2019t anticipate significant shift in upcoming quarters. I do think it\u2019s a good news that our orthopedics business, I will use the word, stabilized in quarter three and the mix improved with hips performing up 2.4%. We had our Craniomaxillofacial growing 2.4%. you heard Chris mention that our knees were up 1 point and that spine continued to improve versus prior quarters. Spine was down around 7.5% in the quarter one and was down about 3.2% in quarter two and down about 1.4% in quarter three. So, clearly, progress but still work to be done on orthopedics. And I believe your last question was related to robots. And I guess, what I would offer is we have a good fortune to enjoy really very strong market leading position in open surgery, which is about 50% of all surgeries are conducted as well as minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. And we intend to have offerings in digital surgery as well as offerings in endoluminal surgery. And we really think that having contribution in all four of those segments will enable a future surgery that J&J can really add a lot of value. So, clearly robotics are having an impact in today\u2019s market. The penetrations are still low, although growing. And I envision Johnson & Johnson has a very competitive offering in the foreseeable future related to digital surgery. Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Danielle Antalffy : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, this question is for Ashley. I just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made earlier regarding transformative M&A. Just curious what you would define as transformative M&A within the device business. And one follow-up to that. Obviously transformative M&A would -- I mean, presumably, that\u2019ll be a large deal. So, in the meantime, it feels like the device business, while you guys are certainly been turning the business around, is still below market growth. You highlighted a number of drivers as it relates to new product launches. But, it feels like it\u2019s going a little bit slower than maybe some people would expect. Are there smaller tuck-in deals that can be done between now and any sort of transformative deal that could accelerate you guys back to in line with market growth? Thank you so much. Ashley McEvoy : Joe, I\u2019ll turn to you first and I\u2019m happy to complement with some commentary. Joe Wolk : Sure. So, thanks for the question, Danielle. With respect to transformative deals or truck-in deals, again, we look at all scale of deals. Last year alone in medical devices, we invested slightly over $1 billion with the 30 tuck-in deals and you\u2019re seeing some of that improve the performance within the Medical Device segment right now. So, again it\u2019s going to come back to those core principles of making sure it\u2019s a strategic fit and then creating value for shareholders. Ashley McEvoy : I would just complement that Danielle with just saying, again historically, 50% of innovation has come from inorganic versus organic, and that blend will continue. As Joe mentioned even in 2018, we\u2019ve already done 26 deals, some those acquisitions, some of those equity, some of those co-promotes. So, it really has to do with the strategic fit and the value-creation in each of the platforms that we compete in. Operator : Next question comes from Jason Bedford with Raymond James. Jason Bedford : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple quickies. First on devices, maybe for Ashley. The 23% growth in Biosense Webster is a notable step-up. You mentioned contribution from new products but you also talked about strong procedure growth. So, I\u2019m just wondering, have you seen any pickup in market growth from the CABANA results last spring? Ashley McEvoy : Thank you, Jason. Yes. We did enjoy 23% growth in quarter three. I think it\u2019s been a very strong combination of market procedures continuing to increase as well as a very strong focus on commercial execution and market creation on ablation, as well as very-balanced geographic growth. We enjoyed in our Biosense Webster business growth of 34% in Asia and 11% in EMEA as well as 20% in North America; again, the combination of core performance as well as some of the new products taking effect. Jason Bedford : Okay. Thank you. Joe Wolk : The CABANA data, I would say that\u2019s -- it maybe had a slight impact in terms of overall procedural market growth, but nothing that the team called out as a significant driver. Jason Bedford : Okay. So, there is clearly some share capture here in your view? [Audio Gap] Joe Wolk : Next question, please? Operator : The next question is from Amit Hazan with Citi. Amit Hazan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just maybe start with the utilization stats that you guys gave. The U.S. surgical procedures are now up for a second straight quarter in a row after I think like 7 straight down quarters. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you guys could take a stab at trying to explain what might be happening with underlying surgical procedures in the U.S.? Joe Wolk : Thanks, Amit for question. So, I think, when we look at a strong economy across the globe where -- is really where our strength has been. If you look, we\u2019re actually growing outside the U.S. stronger, 2X times what we\u2019ve grown here in the U.S. But, a strong economy does tend to lend itself to better coverage and better healthcare. So, that is helping underpin some of the procedural growth that we\u2019re seeing. Amit Hazan : Okay. And then, specifically, with regard to your surgery business, the U.S. advanced piece, in the U.S. there was obviously a good number this quarter. But, you\u2019re actually still trending about 2% growth for the year versus about 6% for the past few years. Maybe just some color for you guys on why you\u2019re having slower growth in advanced this year, and just kind of a similar trend in U.S. general as well? Ashley McEvoy : This is Ashley speaking. A couple of things. One, in our Ethicon surgical business, clearly we enjoy many market leading positions. And I\u2019ll come back to the next. What I\u2019m pleased to see is that our endocutter business is up 10% in quarter three, our biosurgery up 9%. Consistent growth in our wound closure where we enjoy market leading, really driven by some innovation on barbed sutures, and a lot of evidence generation strategy related to the antimicrobial effect for infection reduction. We are seeing challenges clearly in reprocessing and robotics in some of our energy and endomechanical business. OUS, our energy business is performing quite well, but we are experiencing some challenges in the U.S. related to robotics and some reprocessing. I do expect that when -- the advancement of our robotic offering and digital surgery in forthcoming years that will help ameliorate that. We\u2019ve also dialed up the innovation agenda and our endomechanical and energy business to really stronger -- compete in the handheld market. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple, maybe just one to follow up on some of the comments around drug pricing, those -- we\u2019ve seen a lot from the administration yesterday. Obviously the proposal came out around meeting to include, and some of the TV ads. And I\u2019m just curious that you can maybe provide your perspective on this issue and just do you think this is something useful or not useful? And maybe more broadly, any other sort of broader changes that you think might be implemented by the administration, I think, that sort of played out here over the last several months? And then, second is just on DARZALEX. I appreciate the comments you made about the quarter. I\u2019m just curious about the MAIA study. And I think that was previously listed as potential clinical presentation this year. It\u2019s not on the given slide now. And I\u2019m assuming, you\u2019re still going to get that internally. And just I\u2019m asking if you can clarify exactly when you expect that data, and should we expect some sort of top-line press release when you receive it? And then maybe, again, generally how important that data is to the longer term outlook for that product? Thanks. Jennifer Taubert : So, as it relates yesterday to the administration\u2019s proposal, as well as hopefully you saw as well that PhRMA put forward some new principles that the PhRMA members will be adhering to. We really believe that patients should have access to the information that is helpful and that they can use to make the best decisions regarding their health. And so, this does include greater transparency around health care costs. And so, we\u2019ve been a leader in transparency to-date. That\u2019s why we provide information about how we price our medicines and how we invest our resources in our annual U.S. Transparency Report. So, we are absolutely working in partnership with PhRMA around PhRMA\u2019s announcements yesterday and what we can do on DTC pricing. This has been done in line with what we learned from customers and patients, and what they think is actually going to be helpful, which is not only information on list pricing, but also putting that information into the right context. So, what that actually means for them, since list point -- list price is really just a starting point. So for patients, what is their likely out of pocket costs going to be, what types of financial assistance is available in addition to information, like the list price. So, we\u2019re going to respond to the agency\u2019s proposal. There\u2019s 60 days we\u2019re going to go ahead and respond to that and provide our input, in the meantime, go ahead and implement what we\u2019re executing and what we\u2019re doing in line with PhRMA on that. Again, I think anything that is helpful and useful for patients and helps to put all the information in context is going to be really good for them. I think, we just need to be careful of things such as list price alone is not the full extent of the information. And we would worry about patients not going to their doctor to seek care, not going in for the appropriate treatments. So, we believe we\u2019re doing the right thing with just the PhRMA proposal, and we\u2019ll just to have to wait and see what happens with Secretary Azar\u2019s proposal that he announced yesterday. Joe Wolk : Yes. And regarding DARZALEX, it\u2019s 2019 filing; it\u2019s an event driven. So, that\u2019s all we\u2019re sharing at this point in time. Jennifer Taubert : And we\u2019re very optimistic about that data. And we think it will be an important further catalyst for DARZALEX is that is that data will be the regimen that is most commonly used in the United States. So, we already have that frontline data and used with VELCADE, ex-U.S. as well as approved in the U.S. We think the data including REVLIMID is going to be really important going forward for the U.S. market. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thank you very much and good morning. Joe, if okay, I wanted to ask a quick question on emerging markets. Obviously, emerging markets have been in the press quite a bit lately, both in terms of volatility of currency and emerging market economies. So, I\u2019m just curious, can you give us a sense, in your third calendar quarter, kind of what to happened your businesses in emerging markets, maybe some flavor by division, if okay just in terms of did anything really change in terms of underlying demand or the growth rate that you achieved in emerging markets in your three big divisions? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Bob. So in our emerging markets, we saw very healthy growth; in total, it\u2019s about on operational basis almost 13%. And it was pretty uniform across the board, I would say BRIC specifically was very strong with 15% or better growth in Brazil, Russia and China. Maybe I can turn it over to Jorge, because we did see some particular strength out of our consumer business and maybe just talk about the consumer results at large in the third quarter. Obviously, that was a significant step change for us, performing what we believe is going to be twice the market. And Jorge, maybe if you can share a few of those thoughts? Jorge Mesquita : Sure. Thanks, Joe. Yes, we feel very good about our results in the third quarter, growing overall north of 6% organically. And as Joe mentioned, the emerging markets were contributor to this growth, growing above 10% across the key geographies. Particularly, we saw a very strong performance in the BRIC markets. And we continue to expect that over time, the emerging world will continue to grow at twice the rate of overall of our business at a global level. Underpinning our performance was a significant improvement in our baby care business. We\u2019re very pleased with the early results coming out of our state tour in the United States. And as Joe mentioned, we\u2019re now going to roll that out across the world, starting with India and China. And we expect to complete the global rollout across the emerging world into 2019. So, we are -- despite the occasional volatility in some functional markets, I think overall, we\u2019re bullish on the outlook for the emerging world as we go forward. Bob Hopkins : That\u2019s super helpful. Maybe just, Joe, one quick follow-up on that. So, it sounds like underlying demand is very strong across the board, especially as you mentioned, Consumer. But, given the volatility in emerging market currencies, maybe just qualitatively or quantitatively, as you look forward, is that a meaningful headwind to reported EPS, as we look forward, given the volatility or is that something that\u2019s in your mind very manageable, relative to all the different moving pieces that are involved with the J&J income statement? Joe Wolk : Bob, it\u2019s a good question. I would think it should be a manageable headwind, and obviously, it\u2019s going to depend on how much currencies fluctuate. But, we\u2019re not overly tied to currencies in emerging markets. So, it should be manageable. Bob Hopkins : Terrific. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Wolk : I just want to take a moment here too and follow up maybe on Jennifer\u2019s comments with respect to Secretary Azar\u2019s proposal and just be very clear that with -- we support the administration\u2019s spirit of transparency and getting more information out there. I think the position of PhRMA right now is we want to make sure that we provide that information in a way that\u2019s meaningful and provides clarity to patients. Having list price on DTC ads could be somewhat confusing and actually act as a deterrent to good responsible healthcare. And we just want to make sure that that doesn\u2019t play out that way. But certainly looking to digest the proposal and put it into practice, the best way possible that\u2019s meaningful for patients and the healthcare system. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just had a few for Jennifer and maybe Joe too. To revisit the 2019 question, you guys haven\u2019t given a formal view, but just given the headwind on Pharma organic growth from ZYTIGA and the other LOAs. If you\u2019re not above market growth, does that change strategic priorities, either you attitude towards deals or investments across different therapeutic categories? Joe Wolk : Yes. So, Geoff, maybe the first thing is to clarify the question that we currently believe we are the holder of a strong patent and we plan to defend those rights. We\u2019re looking forward to the judge\u2019s decision later this month. But, as Jennifer indicated, our growth, even without ZYTIGA was very strong. There are some potentially generic headwinds on the horizon. Should that for some reason put us below market, which is not something that other companies face, given the breadth of our portfolio, we\u2019ve got 12 brands in Pharmaceuticals that deliver better than $1 billion in revenue. We can absorb that. So, we\u2019re not in a situation where we\u2019re going to take a year or two off from growth. And anything that\u2019s at market is probably only temporary because we\u2019ve got good confidence in our pipeline going forward. Geoff Meacham : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Joe. And then, a few product specific questions for Pharma. For DARZALEX, how has the duration of therapy been tracking? And how do you guys feel the refractory myeloma space evolving when you look at the cell therapies for BCMA? And then, on XARELTO, I just want to get a sense for the feedback from the field following MARINER and COMMANDER since ESC and just trying to put these data in context of the overall brand? Thanks. Jennifer Taubert : Sure, I can start off on the XARELTO piece. So, we just got approval last week for a CAD and PAD, and the team is actually out launching it as we speak. So, product is in the market and the teams are out in the market, launching and bringing XARELTO and the 2.5 milligram dose to patients. And so, we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to expand XARELTO as the first Factor 10a inhibitor in the CAD, PAD space, which expands the opportunity by I think 13 million additional patients in the U.S. alone. And the data is quite striking in that indication, 24% reduction in CV death, strokes and heart attacks. So, we\u2019re really very optimistic about this launch for XARELTO. As it relates to MARINER and the data that we have across the medically ill space, we are working with the agency on that and do believe that there is a good path forward in that space for XARELTO. So, probably can\u2019t say anymore than that on that right now. But, we will be continuing to pursue that with the FDA going forward. So, we believe there is a good reasons for future growth in XARELTO as well as continued growth in share gains in both the AFib and DVT prevention and treatment space. And the other question was on sort of CAR-T and DARZALEX? Geoff Meacham : Around DARZALEX and CAR-T, how they might play together? Jennifer Taubert : Yes. So, we actually think that they\u2019re complementary in the multiple myeloma space. And so, we\u2019re very excited about CAR-T. We\u2019ve dosed our first patient already, which is a very, very fast timeline versus when we did that deal with Legend. I think if you take a look at the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma, there -- it still remains significant need. And so, I think having both, DARZALEX as well as what we got with the BCMA CAR-T together will be a nice portfolio for patients, which will allow us to continue to grow. Geoff Meacham : Okay, great. Thank you. Chris DelOrefice : So, that concludes today\u2019s Q&A portion. Thanks to everyone who asked a question today and apologies to those who we could not get to due to time. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as is needed with any follow-ups. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Joe for some closing remarks. Joe Wolk : Great. Thanks Chris. Thank you, Ashley, Jorge, Jennifer for sharing your insights on our business and delivering your -- with your team\u2019s very strong results for the third quarter. I hope it is clear to you and the investment community that our business is very strong. And we look forward to living into the new guidance that we have articulated earlier today for 2018. Thanks for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Hello. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018. Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. We are very pleased with our 2018 fourth quarter and full year results. Once again, our performance illustrates a track record of consistent growth, exceeding financial expectations and making progress on our long-term strategies. Sales for the business accelerated versus 2017 on both an operational and adjusted basis.  Consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, this acceleration was driven by the continued strength of our Pharmaceutical segment, delivering on our objective of restoring consumer growth to above-market levels and improving performance in Medical Devices. 2018 also marked another year of disciplined portfolio management, including the completion of key divestitures while also advancing our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and collaborative agreements that we believe will fortify long-term performance. As we enter 2019, we are confident in the strength of our business. We believe our Pharmaceutical business will deliver growth while absorbing significant impacts from biosimilar and generic competition. We expect Consumer to maintain above-market growth, and we anticipate our Medical Devices segment will continue to improve. We plan to deliver innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers and consumers while also delivering solid financial performance.  A few logistics before we get into the details.

Now I'm pleased to share our results for the quarter. Worldwide sales were $20.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, up 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales increased 3.3% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 1.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 5.1% as currency negatively impacted our reported OUS results by 4.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 5.3% worldwide, 2.6% in the U.S. and 8.3% outside the U.S.  For the full year 2018, consolidated sales were $81.6 billion, an increase of 6.7% compared to the full year of 2017. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.3%, with currency having a positive impact of 0.4%. Operational sales growth was strong in both the U.S. increasing 5.1% and in regions outside the U.S. increasing 7.7%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 5.5% worldwide, 3.4% in the U.S. and 7.8% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.12 versus diluted earnings per share of negative $3.99 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.97, representing increases of 12.5% and 13.2%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16.1%.  Regarding the full year, 2018 net earnings were $15.3 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.61. 2018 adjusted net earnings were $22.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share was $8.18, up 11.4% and 12.1%, respectively, versus full year of 2017 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.4%. Joe will provide additional details about earnings in his remarks.  Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2018 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion, growing above the market at 3.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, such as the divestiture of COMPEED in the Wound Care franchise and NIZORAL in the beauty franchise, offset by the acquisition of Zarbee's portfolio of naturally-based products in our OTC business, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.8%. Consumer continues to grow share in the e-commerce channel, outpacing category growth rates with strong double-digit growth across all regions.  The Beauty franchise continues to deliver strong performance, growing 2.5% or 4.5% adjusted for the impact of the NIZORAL divestiture. U.S. growth was driven by strength in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA due to new products and market growth. OUS growth was primarily driven by the continued market expansion of the Vogue portfolio, including OGX and Maui Moisture brands in EMEA and Latin America. Additionally, NEUTROGENA continues to perform strong in Asia fueled by new products, including our Hydro Boost platform.  Over-the-counter medicines grew globally 6.4% or 3.7% when adjusting for the impact of the Zarbee's acquisition. In the U.S., OTC share growth is well outpacing the category with 13 brands gaining share, driving growth of over 13%. TYLENOL, in particular, showed solid growth, driven by strong consumption in addition to benefiting from seasonal and other retail stocking dynamics. OUS performance declined 2%, driven by declining sales of upper respiratory brands in Russia due to a soft cough, cold and flu season, partially offset by strong growth in our smoking cessation business in Canada.  Oral Care grew 4.4% globally, with strong growth in the U.S. driven by the performance of innovative new launches, including LISTERINE Ready! Tabs, and strong growth outside the U.S., primarily in China. Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care grew 2.1% globally. Recent performance trends of the Johnson's baby relaunch continue to be positive, with U.S. consumption data up 7 points since the launch. The U.S., however, experienced net sales declines in the quarter, driven by lower BabyCenter media sales, coupled with declines in DESITIN due to trade promotion spending shifts in prior year comparables. Sales growth outside the U.S. was led by strong AVEENO Baby growth, primarily in China.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $10.2 billion grew 7.2% with double-digit growth in 7 key products, resulting in continued above-market performance. Sales increased in the U.S. by 2.8% and outside the U.S. by 13.7%. U.S. sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of generic competition for ZYTIGA, which had about 100 basis point impact on U.S. growth, along with some increased discounts, primarily in XARELTO.  Sales growth was led by the oncology therapeutic area with worldwide growth of 25%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing about 60% globally. U.S. grew 34% and continues to benefit from strong market growth and a 6-point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy based on third quarter data. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries where it is commercially available as well as in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. IMBRUVICA grew about 39% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. and strong uptake outside the U.S. in the European and Asia Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on third quarter data across all lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 4 points of market share and is the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Worldwide ZYTIGA growth slowed to about 6%, with 27% growth outside the U.S., which was partially offset by declines of about 13% in the U.S. due to generic competition. Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains, primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer based on the LATITUDE clinical trial.  In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, with the penetration of prescribers split evenly among urology and oncology practices. We also just received approval in the EU for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  In immunology, we delivered global sales growth of just under 10%, driven by continued strong performance in STELARA of 35%, offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to increased discounts and modest share loss to biosimilars. REMICADE has maintained approximately 93% of the infliximab volume share. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease, where market shares increased by approximately 8 points in the U.S. compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.  Lastly, sales for our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA, totaled $175 million globally. TREMFYA is experiencing strong demand with over 28,000 patients on therapy and achieved a 6.6% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up 1 point from the third quarter. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing almost 12% with higher market share, driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. We did experience declining sales of about 13% in our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in XARELTO and INVOKANA. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share growth. However, this growth was offset by increased discounts and higher Medicare donut hole utilization.  We remain excited by the potential to significantly increase XARELTO's treatable patient population by approximately 13 million patients in the U.S., supported by the U.S. FDA's recent approval of XARELTO's new 2.5-milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. Initial customer response has been positive, and we are confident in the value this indication will provide to patients.  Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by double digits, increasing by about 11%. We realized strong growth in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, growing by about 22% and 40%, respectively, on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. As expected, TRACLEER is declining due to increased use of OPSUMIT as well as generic competition in Europe.  I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.7 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan, adjusted sales growth was 3.3% worldwide and accelerated versus the third quarter. The adjusted operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Interventional Solutions, Advanced Surgery, General Surgery and Vision. Orthopaedics continues to lag market growth with operational sales growth of 0.5% globally but continued its fourth straight quarter of sequential improvement due to strengthening fundamentals including the uptake of new launches.  Interventional Solutions grew over 12% globally, with continued strength in our electrophysiology business, which grew more than 14% worldwide, fueled by our market leadership position from newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedure market growth. This represents 10 consecutive years of double-digit growth. Additionally, we realized strong growth in our CERENOVUS business, with double-digit growth in all regions driven by new product innovation including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke.  Strong Vision results were driven by contact lenses, which grew over 4% globally on the strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS family. Growth outside the U.S. of about 7% was strong with penetration in emerging markets being a large contributor. The U.S. continues to experience high consumption of approximately 7%. However, sales were basically flat due to year-over-year inventory dynamics. Contact lenses have now grown at or above the market for 3 consecutive years.  In Orthopaedics, hips grew 2%, which we expect to represent performance in line with the market, driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS. Trauma growth increased versus the prior quarter to just over 2% globally, driven by improved market growth. We continue to see strong adoption of newer innovations, such as our TFNA femoral nail, and experienced strong growth in Asia, led by China and India.  Spine delivered adjusted operational growth of about 1%. However, this growth was aided by onetime pricing-related true-ups worth about 250 basis points. Adjusting for this, our performance was consistent with third quarter growth. We continue to see stabilization of performance, driven by new products, such as the CONCORDE LIFT Expandable Cage and the VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery.  Knees grew 0.2% in the quarter. As previously disclosed, our third quarter 2018 results were aided by the onetime impact of 2017 price legislation in India that contributed about 280 basis points to growth in the third quarter of 2018. When adjusting for this, our knee portfolio showed strong sequential improvement, primarily outside of the U.S. due to strong performance in Asia. We continue to see strong uptake of the ATTUNE Revision System.  Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopaedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 4.5% in spine, excluding the onetime pricing true-up I mentioned earlier; negative 3.5% in hips; negative 2.5% in knees; and negative 2% in trauma.  We were very pleased with the results for the Surgery business. The Advanced Surgery performance of 5.7% growth globally was led by biosurgery with growth of over 9%, along with strong performance in energy at 5.5%. Biosurgery strength was driven by strong demand aided by new innovation, such as SURGICEL Powder. Endocutters also grew at over 3% despite high-growth comparables from Q4 2017 that were partially driven by a competitor supply disruption last year. In General Surgery, wound closure grew over 7% with growth in all regions as barbed and Plus Sutures are experiencing strong adoption. Additionally, the U.S. market benefited from customers adopting innovative technologies with associated price premiums. As expected, selling days did not have a material impact on our global growth rates in the fourth quarter.  As a final comment regarding U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the third quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in hospital admissions and surgical procedures with both increasing about 1.5%. Lab procedures were also up about 1%. Our preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter indicate a slight declining trend in both hospital admissions and surgical procedures growth to 1% and lab procedures growth consistent with the third quarter at approximately 1%.  That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2018. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're pleased to be highlighting the strong results we delivered in 2018. Given the focused execution of our performance-driven strategy, I'm proud to share that we exceeded the financial performance metrics we set at the beginning of last year. And we also delivered on the commitments and responsibilities to our patients, employees and communities as defined in our credo.  Now as you've heard me mention throughout 2018, we have been celebrating the 75th anniversary of our credo. Introduced in 1943 by General Robert Wood Johnson, our credo has been the blueprint for shaping the caring role that Johnson & Johnson plays in society. Although our credo is etched in stone, it is a living document that on a few select occasions, we have evolved to keep pace with the world in which we live. To that end, in anticipation of the 75th anniversary, we introduced some enhancements to our credo responsibilities that were inspired by feedback from more than 2,000 of our diverse Johnson & Johnson employees, representing all regions, sectors and functions. These enhancements explicitly put the patient first and at the center of our focus, reflect the needs of a changing world in a new generation of employees, underscore our commitment to diversity and inclusion and solidify our commitment to improving the health of humanity. Our credo remains as relevant today as when it was first introduced 75 years ago, and I'm excited and confident that, together, we will propel Johnson & Johnson forward to shape the next 75 years and beyond of health care.  With that long-term mindset, we remain focused on leveraging our broad-based capabilities to continue to drive the next generation of growth across our entire portfolio, both in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete as well as in the markets where we lead, which include our 26 platforms that each deliver $1 billion or more in sales annually.  In Consumer, we improved operational performance and delivered above-market growth in 2018 while also making investments for the future, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly. Key drivers were the development and rollout of innovative new products, the continued geographic expansion across the evolving consumer channels and the strong sales performance of our most popular brands, such as NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, TYLENOL, MOTRIN and LISTERINE, as well as strong performance in newer brands, such as OGX. Additionally, our global Johnson's Baby relaunch is off to a strong start, and we will continue to launch into other markets in 2019.  In Pharmaceuticals, our strong track record of success continued throughout 2018. We achieved above-market performance even in the face of biosimilar competition for REMICADE, which was driven by double-digit growth in 10 key products including STELARA, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and OPSUMIT, to name a few.  And at the same time, we continued to invest in and advance our robust pipeline, which translates to better outcomes and treatment options for patients fighting cancer, HIV, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia and diseases of the immune system. In fact, we were just recently ranked among the top 3 companies worldwide working to expand access to medicines by the 2018 Access to Medicines Index. In Medical Devices, consistent sales momentum throughout the year was fueled by Interventional Solutions, Advanced Surgery and Vision. We promised improved performance starting in 2018, and our team is delivering on this promise by improving our cadence of innovation, coupled with continued portfolio optimization, as we completed the divestiture of LifeScan and completed more than 30 acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we expect will further augment our future growth. We know we still have more work to do, and we are committed to continuing to build upon this momentum and return to above-market growth in 2020.  Now when I think about value creation, I'm proud to highlight that 2018 marked our 35th consecutive year of adjusted operational earnings growth for Johnson & Johnson of approximately 10%. This robust performance is indicative of the strength of our broad-based business, and these results reflect our ongoing commitment to manage the long term, our relentless drive for innovation, our strategic portfolio management and our disciplined capital allocation strategy, all of which are regularly discussed with our Board of Directors as part of our ongoing strategic planning. As you've heard me say before, while we're pleased with our 2018 performance, it's important to remember that we are never satisfied. Looking ahead, we're committed to advancing the innovation pipeline in our Pharmaceutical business, broadening the reach of our Consumer business and meeting the full potential of our Medical Devices business. I want to emphasize that our #1 priority is to drive superior performance across all our businesses.  To ensure this, we benchmark, track and hold every one of our Johnson & Johnson leaders accountable for key metrics that focus on innovation, execution, customer satisfaction, financial performance, portfolio management, quality, long-term value creation and, importantly, credo values in leadership.  We believe that sustaining our investment in innovation is a key aspect of our strategy. We achieved record levels of investment, investing approximately $11 billion in R&D. And across all industries, we are one of the top 10 companies that invest at the highest levels in innovation and R&D.  We remain committed to being a strategic partner of choice, evidenced by the over $1 billion we invested in 2018 across a number of value-creating acquisitions and collaborations, which includes Zarbee's, Orthotaxy, our collaboration with Arrowhead in Hepatitis B and, most recently, our agreement with argenx for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and other hematological malignancies, which closed last week.  In total, we signed 13 acquisitions and licenses of various sizes, including our acquisition of the company that markets the Dr.Ci:Labo line of skin care products, which we closed last week. We also signed 74 innovation deals, and we made 29 new investments from our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation during 2018. Additionally, I'm pleased to share that last week, we announced that, in collaboration with Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson will conduct a research study to analyze whether a new heart health program using an app from Johnson & Johnson, in combination with the Apple Watch's irregular rhythm notifications and electrocardiogram app, can accelerate the diagnosis and improve health outcomes of the 33 million people worldwide living with atrial fibrillation or AFib.  Now this is a condition that can lead to stroke and other potentially devastating complications. In fact, in the U.S. alone, AFib is responsible for approximately 130,000 deaths and 750,000 hospitalizations every year. We are very optimistic about the potential of this wearable technology, which can aid in the earlier detection and prevention of a frequent cause of stroke. And based upon the insights generated to this research program, in the future, we may be able to develop new ways to detect other health conditions earlier that also exhibit measurable physiological symptoms.  Now moving forward, we will continue to enhance our status as a preferred partner, be agnostic to where the best science and technology resides and aggressively pursue transformational innovation internally and through our innovation ecosystem across our innovation centers, JLABS and JJDC and various strategic partnerships.  As our portfolio evolves through innovation, acquisitions and growth initiatives, we also regularly evaluate each of our existing businesses to determine if they still fit our strategy and our criteria for value creation. As a result, and as you have seen us do, we undertake a process to consider if different ownership for our business might be value-enhancing or if the business might be a better fit in another company's portfolio.  This process also ensures that we continue to invest in the most promising areas of our portfolio where we believe we can make a significant difference for patients and consumers and create greater value for our shareholders. In 2018, we executed 6 divestitures, including LifeScan in October, and we also accepted a binding offer to divest our ASP business, which we expect to close in the first half of 2019.  Now I'm sure we've all come to accept that the change we are seeing across the health care industry and around the world is the new normal. It's constant, and it's rapid. Challenges and opportunities arise with breathtaking speed. And we are committed to thriving in this environment. We feel strongly that our broad base in health care provides a distinct competitive advantage. By being positioned across 3 vital aspects of health care, pharmaceuticals, Consumer and Medical Devices, we have a unique insight into challenges and opportunities as they emerge and are better positioned, I believe, than any other organization to meet the needs of patients and consumers around the world and to address the challenges and opportunities that the world and economy present. Our broad base was not just our heritage, it's a strategic choice, grounded and proven the long-term performance and our understanding of the industry's present and future. As the world's largest and most broadly based health care company, we understand the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity. We work with many organizations with similar aspirations, such as the Business Roundtable, the CEO Force for Good and the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism. When we look at the current marketplace, business landscape and our external environment, we are often asked about the potential impacts to our business and industries. To this end, throughout the course of 2018, we engaged with global leaders, government officials, business partners and customers in countries around the world on a variety of topics to not only impact current access to quality health care, but that will also drive the quality of health care for the future.  I'd like to share a perspective on a few of those key topics today. Now regarding overall health care cost and drug pricing in the United States, the cost of health care is one of the most pressing issues facing our country today, and we greatly recognize the importance of quality and accessible health care and medication as central to every individual's quality to life. We share the administration's goals of reducing health care costs while improving the quality and efficiency of care. In our effort to offer solutions that help achieve these goals, we responded to several administration proposals, offering insights on ways to expand value-based care and value-based arrangements.  We understand why there is such a passionate dialogue on health care cost and drug pricing. There's likely nothing more personal or important to every individual than quality and accessible health care. We also recognize that people are facing higher out-of-pocket costs when they seek medical care from a hospital, a doctor's office or some other alternative health care provider and especially when they go to the pharmacy to get medication.  But it's important to note, medicines represent 14% of the total health care cost in the U.S., and Medical Devices represent 6% of the total health care cost in the United States. The remaining 80% is accounted for by areas outside of our industry. Additionally, we can all agree that the value derived from innovative medicines has been and continues to be significant in addressing health issues today and reducing morbidity rates in the future.  Furthermore, medicines have contributed greatly to extending life expectancy. For example, back in the 1980s, the life expectancy of an HIV patient was just 6 months. Today, we are close to providing patients a near normal life expectancy. People are now surviving 30 to 40 years after diagnosis. While HIV patients still need to take medication every day, we can keep them healthy for the rest of their lives.  We are also working with various partners in the health care system to transform the way health care is paid for. So everyone involved is held accountable and rewarded for the value they deliver. Now there are a few key priorities that we focus on when participating in the health care cost and drug pricing dialogue, and they include : a system that rewards innovation. We believe companies have an obligation to continually help improve the standard of health care by investing in science and technology to develop new solutions and new products. Additionally, we want to see a personalized and value-based health care system, which keeps the patient at the center and is held accountable for the overall outcome.  Next, a system that values transparency. Transparency benefits all participants in the health care system, and I'm really proud that our Pharmaceutical business has taken such a strong leadership stance on increasing transparency in the industry. Last year, we issued our second annual report on transparency, which showed that the net price of our medicines in the U.S. decreased in 2017. We are preparing to issue our 2018 Transparency Report in the next couple of months, but I can already tell you that, in 2018, our net prices declined between 6% and 8%. And we look forward to providing more information when the report is released. These results demonstrate our commitment to responsible business practices that put patients first, including how we invest our resources, price our medicines and help people who need our medicines get access to them.  Third, as we continue to engage in dialogue and develop proposals to contain health care cost, stakeholders need to be extremely careful and cognizant about avoiding unintended consequences, which may increase patient's cost further and/or decrease patient's access to affordable and quality health care. We know this continues to be a very important issue, and it's our responsibility to help lead and identify solutions. And we will continue to unite around efforts that address some of the most critical health and consumer needs of people around the world. We will continue to seek opportunities to work with the administration and others who share our commitment to developing a more results-based health system.  Turning to the topic of global trade. As a global health care company, Johnson & Johnson relies on free trade and open markets to bring its products to patients and consumers around the world. We are hopeful that an agreement can be reached with China that addresses concerns and creates a long-term framework for partnership in the future. We'll continue to work with government officials across the globe because fair and equitable trade is in everyone's best interest, not just for companies, but for the consumer. We will also continue to monitor developments closely on this front as we expect this to be an issue in motion for some time.  Lastly, regarding our global view, we are committed to being a leader in the global health care space to help drive the change that people around the world want and need to see. We recognize this through collaboration and viable strategies which are developed in conjunction with the health care industry, governments, community leaders and other health care professionals that we can successfully solve issues and seek solutions that advance health for humanity. And despite any challenges that lie ahead, we remain optimistic about the future of the health care industry based upon the strategic plans we have in place, the innovative technology and solutions we leverage every day and the talented people across Johnson & Johnson who remain committed to delivering life-saving and life-changing solutions to our patients and consumers everywhere.  Now before I move on to talk about our long-term objectives and 2019 outlook, I do think it's important to reiterate that the quality and safety of our products are a top priority. As it relates to our baby powder, which has been a trusted product for over 100 years, we remain committed to ensuring the facts about talc are understood, and we will continue to defend the safety of our product. We have a legacy of working hard to earn our customers' trust and working equally hard to keep it. We will continue to focus on meeting the needs of the patients and consumers around the world who have come to depend on us and put their trust in us each and every day. As I have consistently shared with you, our long-term objectives remain focused on growing our sales organically at a faster rate than the market and growing our earnings faster than sales. Now that, coupled with value-creating M&A and our strong dividend yield, is the basis for our strong long-term total shareholder returns. And in keeping with our credo commitment that everything we do must be of high quality, quality and safety remain paramount across Johnson & Johnson, and this enables us to operate from a position of strength. This is important for all stakeholders, especially the value that is experienced by every patient and consumer we touch.  And as the health care landscape continues to evolve and change, so does our business and business strategies. In response to these changing dynamics, at an enterprise level, we remain committed to our near-term priorities, which are consistent with our long-term growth objectives.  With regard to our 2019 outlook, we remain focused on bringing innovative solutions to patients and consumers globally as well as driving strong growth while anticipating biosimilar and generic impact to some of our Pharmaceutical products in the near term, which we expect will impact sales by approximately $3 billion. To address this impact, we have deliberately and actively managed our portfolio for the last few years and especially throughout 2018.  As I've already mentioned, we regularly make portfolio management decisions that gives the flexibility to invest in innovation, pursue M&A deals, divest and withstand the impact of patent erosion. Our robust long-term strategy has enabled us to make the investments necessary to not only withstand this impact, but to grow at competitive rates in 2019. Additionally, we are continuing to progress our current robust pipeline of differentiated and novel products.  So even in the face of these short-term pressures, we remain confident that our marketed portfolio and near-term pipeline across our Pharmaceutical business will be one of our key growth drivers into the future. Additionally, we expect to deliver on our financial, quality and innovation commitments as well as to continue to optimize our portfolio.  Now let me provide some greater detail and deeper insights regarding each of our business segments. As I just mentioned in Pharmaceuticals, we expect to drive the growth of our end market products and successfully launch new products and line extensions while replenishing our pipeline to support sustained long-term above-market growth. With an industry-leading pipeline and a stamped excellence, our Pharmaceutical business has delivered outstanding and sustained performance for the past several years, growing operationally in 2018 at approximately 12%, inclusive of the impact of negative net price, driven by the successful launches and growth of many blockbuster medicines. Pharmaceuticals has been an industry leader in all performance measures, including R&D productivity and commercial capabilities.  Our key catalysts for growth include : reaching more patients; continuing to penetrate and secure new indications for life-changing products, such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA; driving best-in-class uptake of the successful new product launches, such as TREMFYA and ERLEADA; and securing regulatory approvals for esketamine and erdafitinib, which are 2 promising new therapeutics with a potential for more than $1 billion of peak revenue.  In 2018, fueled by iconic brands and unparalleled consumer insights, our Consumer business achieved above-market growth. Moving forward, we will concentrate on enhancing our leadership and priority categories by focusing on critical geographies and our mega brands. We will also continue to look to expand in the fast-growing natural category, as evident by the acquisition of Zarbee's in OTC and the premium beauty category with our recent acquisition of the company that markets the Dr.Ci:Labo line of skin care products. I am confident that we have the strategies in place to allow us to move with the agility needed to address new market needs with an omnichannel approach from the large box retailers to the e-commerce channels to better serve our consumers.  In Consumer, we expect to continue to grow slightly above market, advance our e-commerce and digital capabilities and deliver innovation to win both globally and locally while expanding margins. Our key catalysts for growth focus on continuing to build upon the early success of the Johnson's Baby brand relaunch, broadening the scope of our innovation model to accelerate growth of our beloved brands to more consumers around the world wherever and however they shop and enduring brand portfolio strength through sustained innovation, delivering differentiated products that are professionally endorsed and science-based. That's our history, and that will be our future. In Medical Devices, we expect to accelerate growth through improved execution and enhance the flow and value of innovation, which includes the progression of digital surgery platforms. And as we capitalize on our comprehensive portfolio and accelerating growth strategy, we expect to deliver on our commitment to improve performance as we did in 2018, where we improved operational growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, by 1.1% as compared to 2017.  Additionally, we delivered on our commitment to improve our cadence of innovation by exceeding our goal and delivering 21 major product launches in 2018. Still, we fully recognize that our progress has not been uniform across the entire portfolio. There are areas where we must and we will improve, specifically in Orthopaedics. We demonstrated positive progress throughout 2018 in our knees and spine businesses, and we believe this sets us up well for 2019 and beyond.  In Medical Devices, we will continue to accelerate growth through innovation, strategic partnerships, portfolio management and new business models. Our key catalyst for growth in Medical Devices include : fueling growth from top platforms, such as electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery and Vision; continuing to increase our cadence of innovation by launching 20 to 25 major new products across our Orthopaedics, Surgery, Interventional and Vision portfolios, such as ATTUNE cementless, ECHELON next-gen powered stapler, the VIZIGO steerable sheath and ACUVUE OASYS, which transitions light intelligent technology, and by maximizing new market growth opportunities, such as stroke, and sites of care beyond the hospital and simplifying operations while relentlessly focusing on execution. We will do this while progressing our efforts in digital surgery including robotics, which is a critical element to our future success, not just in the near term, but as we look to the next decade and beyond.  Now throughout Johnson & Johnson's history, we have proudly and passionately strived to create and maintain a strong, consistent and sustainable business, and this is evidenced by 35 consecutive years of adjusted operational earnings growth, 56 consecutive years of dividend returns and increases, being one of only 2 companies that hold a AAA credit rating and being among the Standard & Poor's top 10 market cap companies. There are also many notable annual recognitions on major publication lists, including Fortune, DiversityInc, TIME magazine and Working Mother, where we are one of the most admired, respected, diverse and best places to work. These strong results and compelling recognitions would not be possible without our talented, diverse and dedicated employees around the world. Today, we employ approximately 135,000 global employees with more than 44,000 jobs here in the U.S. Those numbers continue to grow as we extend our capabilities and our reach.  And we are all united around a shared commitment and a common purpose that inspires a world without disease. This is evident in the tireless efforts and relentless passion that drives our ambition to reach the next frontier of cancer care, continue to combat Ebola, bring healthy vision to people everywhere and create a world free from tuberculosis, just to name a few areas of focus.  Our purpose-driven, credo-based culture puts patients and people first, and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees and work to consistently cultivate the world's best, healthiest and most engaged workforce. I believe this is critical for operating a healthy business. It also positions us very well to deliver another 133 years of quality health care that is within the reach of everyone, everywhere, and it enables us to continue to drive growth and strong shareholder returns.  We are proud of the results we've delivered, not just in 2018 but over the past several years, and we will continue working to achieve and exceed your expectations of us in 2019 and beyond. We have a unique mission. We must lead as stewards of our credo and as leaders in health care around the world. It's not just to deliver great results and shareholder value, it's also to deliver the best medicines and solutions to our patients and consumers around the world. It's about the lives that we touch, the hopes that we raise and the progress of healing, ultimately advancing health for humanity.  Lastly, I'm honored to have led this company for almost 7 years now, and I believe that no company is better positioned to lead the profound change during this dynamic era than Johnson & Johnson. I'm proud of our history and could not be more excited about our future. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I'll now turn it over to Joe, who will provide additional details about our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2019. Thank you. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone. As Alex and Chris mentioned, we are pleased with our performance in 2018, which exhibited the strength of our portfolio and disciplined management of our business. In fact, our adjusted operational sales growth of 5.5% was the highest since 2014, and our adjusted EPS growth was the highest in over 10 years. We ended the year exceeding the consensus estimates from the latest analyst models for both revenue and earnings per share. Our results were also at the higher end or exceeded the ranges that we provided in October for the full year guidance.  Since Chris already provided a detailed overview of sales for the quarter and Alex has provided an overall business update, I'll provide commentary on the P&L, cash and guidance for 2019. I will start by sharing highlights regarding the full year 2018 statement of earnings.  Please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our latest guidance for 2018 was in the range of 9.3% to 10%. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $8.18 reflects reported growth of 12.1% and operational growth of 10.4%, again, at the upper end of our estimate range for reported EPS and exceeding our operational guidance from October, driven by our strong sales results and margin improvement. Regarding adjusted pretax operating margins, our latest guidance come into at least 150 basis point improvement versus 2017. For the full year, we exceeded those projections, achieving a 210 basis point improvement while we continue to invest in our business. This improvement is attributable to sales growth and leveraging our scale for productivity, coupled with improved cost of goods sold due to mix and volume.  Moving to the next slide. These improvements are reflected in our full year 2018 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, which improved 100 basis points versus 2017. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 29.5% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to reduced divestiture gains as well as investments targeted to improve sales growth. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 320 basis points to 42%, driven by improved cost of goods and leveraging SG&A as well as the timing of milestones in R&D. Consumer margins slightly improved to 20.5%.  Now a few words about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018, please direct your attention to the boxed section towards the bottom of the schedule where we provide our adjusted earnings, which excludes intangible amortization expense and special items of $2.3 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion and litigation expense of $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $1.97, an increase of 13.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.02, up 16.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.  I will now highlight a few items that have changed on the GAAP statement of earnings compared to last year. Gross profit margin for the quarter improved by 190 basis points to 65.9%, primarily driven by the impact of inventory step-up for Actelion and favorable mix. Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 15.8%, which is lower than the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower milestone payments in 2018. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into strategic licenses with Legend for our CAR-T asset and exercised our option with Idorsia for a compound to treat patients with resistant hypertension. However, it is worth noting that for the full year, we continued to prioritize funding for innovation, increasing our annual investment in R&D to $10.8 billion.  Other income and expense was a net expense of $978 million in the quarter compared to net income of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was relatively flat with a net gain of $777 million in 2018 compared to a net gain of $892 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting divestiture gains.  Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our tax rate of 2.6% includes adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will be further highlighted in the tax footnote in our upcoming 10-K. A few words on cash. At the end of 2018, we had approximately $11 billion of net debt, which consists of approximately $20 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $31 billion of debt. We estimate that the free cash flow generated for 2018 was $18.6 billion, which was an improvement over 2017 of approximately $800 million.  As announced on December 17, the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of the company's common stock. This authorization was based on our continued strong performance, the confidence we have in our business going forward and the conviction the Board of Directors and management team have that the company shares are an attractive investment opportunity. Through year-end, we completed approximately 20% of the authorized amount.  Let's now focus on the company's guidance for 2019 for you to consider for your models. As Alex mentioned, our 2019 focus is on continuing to deliver growth even in the face of biosimilar and generics impact. As you think about our performance for the upcoming year, let me provide some general qualitative themes that factor into our quantitative thinking. Items that are moving on a positive direction or tailwinds include factors that you have consistently heard from us that exist across our businesses. It starts with the breadth of our portfolio and the strength behind our 26 $1 billion or better platforms.  We also expect that the Consumer segment, relying on innovation and improved go-to-market models, will continue the strength we delivered in the second half of 2018 and expect to grow slightly above the market in 2019. Additionally, we believe that improved execution and new product introductions will enable the Medical Devices segment to continue to improve growth, advancing our goal to be above market in 2020. In Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate recently launched products, such as ERLEADA and TREMFYA, to continue performing as well as products like DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA with continued uptake and new indications added to their approved labels. And finally, we are excited about the potential approvals and launches for NMEs, such as esketamine for treatment-resistant depression and erdafitinib for bladder cancer.  As with any business, there are some offsets or headwinds for us to also consider. Most notably, we anticipate continued biosimilar competition for REMICADE and PROCRIT and generic competition related to VELCADE, TRACLEER and ZYTIGA in the U.S. Pricing pressure is expected to persist, and a stronger U.S. dollar will likely result in a negative impact on reported results in 2019. This next slide illustrates how these qualitative factors are reflected in our guidance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance is based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business to provide the best understanding of our underlying performance.  Despite the headwinds of generic and biosimilar competition of approximately $3 billion, we will continue to grow. This implies the balance of our portfolio will grow organically at about 6.5% in 2019. Netting these 2 factors, we would expect to be in the range of 2% to 3% for adjusted operational sales growth or $83.2 billion to $84 billion in sales. Next, considering the negative impact of net acquisitions and divestitures of about 2%, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 0% to 1% or $81.6 billion to $82.4 billion.  Again, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.14, the estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1.5% and result in an estimated reported sales decline of minus 1.5% to minus 0.5% compared to 2018 or $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion. This slide recaps all line items we provide for our full year 2019 guidance. Since I have discussed sales guidance, I will now focus on the remaining components of our P&L guidance including EPS. For 2019, we are expecting adjusted pretax operating margin to slightly improve while still prioritizing investment in our business for the long term.  Although we are continuously evaluating external value-creating opportunities in line with our capital allocation strategy, for purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash other than the current share repurchase program, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $100 million and $200 million, lower than 2018 due to expected lower levels of debt and higher anticipated interest income than the prior year. As you are aware, other income and expense is the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to items, such as litigation, investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2019 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as net income ranging from $2 billion to $2.3 billion.  We recognize that this is higher than 2018, and we intend to deploy a portion of this income into investments across the enterprise to fortify our existing internal pipelines as well as to obtain external sources of innovation to bolster long-term growth, which we do as part of our continual portfolio management strategy. For reference, this level of other income is consistent with levels we had experienced in 2017 and 2015. In the subsequent years of 2016 and 2018, we reduced other income by significant levels and still delivered strong financial results that produced adjusted earnings growth.  Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2019 excluding special items is approximately 17% to 18%. This guidance takes into account our latest assumptions regarding income mix as well as other onetime favorable items in 2018 that we are not planning to reoccur. Considering all these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $8.65 to $8.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 5.7% to 7.6%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.50 to $8.65 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 4.9% or $8.58 per share at the midpoint. We often get asked about first half-second half dynamics or quarterly nuances. We do not provide quarterly guidance, but there are a few factors to consider in your modeling. The first half of 2018 was the Pharmaceutical segment's stronger half, which did not include the impact of ZYTIGA U.S. generic entries. We would also expect a higher level of R&D investment earlier in the year, anticipating the closing of the recently announced argenx deal. Towards the end of the year, we will obviously lap the U.S. ZYTIGA generics entry late in the fourth quarter. Lastly, based on today's spot rates, currency will have a more negative impact in the first half of 2019.  That concludes our financial summary. I trust you see the broad-based strength of our business in the 2018 results and in the guidance we've provided for 2019. While there are some headwinds this year, we are confident in our ability to grow operational sales and EPS in spite of those headwinds, which will position us extremely well not just for 2019 but for years beyond.  I am pleased to turn the call back to Chris to initiate the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. Before we move to the Q&A portion of the webcast, please remember to mark your calendars for our Pharmaceutical Business Review, which is scheduled for Wednesday, May 15. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : I guess, my first one was just on -- a little bit more on your assumption for net U.S. price -- pharma pricing in 2019. I think you mentioned a 6% to 8% erosion in 2018. Just talk a little bit about how we should think about dynamics as we think about this year. And then my second question was specifically on XARELTO and just a little bit more about the 4Q performance. It's a little bit more what's happening with net price for the product. And as we think about 2019 for that product, how are we thinking about kind of balancing, I guess, competitive dynamics in the core indications, the step-up in the donut hole against the recent label expansion? I'm just trying to get hands around some of the pushes and pulls on that product specifically. Joseph Wolk : Great. Chris, thanks for the question. With respect to net U.S. pharma pricing, what Alex referred to was obviously the experience we had in 2018, which was greater than 6%. As we see it right now, we'll provide some more details in our Transparency Report, which should be out in about 4 to 6 weeks. In terms of going forward, we do expect it to be elevated levels. What I would say is, it's a great testament to the -- just the strength of the innovative portfolio that we have in the Pharmaceutical segment. We grew about 8% for the year, and that is in the face of net price decreases of greater than 6%. We don't predict, obviously, for competitive reasons what they may look like going forward, but we do plan for continued price decreases on a net basis into the future. With respect to XARELTO, yes, I think what you saw in the quarter was some of those pricing dynamics. There was some catch-up with respect to donut hole provisions. To a modest level, some inventory adjustments in terms of the pipeline out there. We are growing our volume. We are gaining prescription share. So we feel good about the brand. And as we move into 2019, we would expect the CAD/PAD indications to be a differentiating factor moving forward to expand not only market share for the brand, but also the market itself as it's going to reach a broader base of patients. Operator : Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : I'm just hoping you could give a little bit more color on the Medical Device business and what you're seeing from a utilization perspective more broadly. Did you see a seasonal uptick in Q4? And generally, in 2018? And what you're expecting for 2019 for that business, considering all the moving parts as it relates to the economy? Is it slowing? Is it -- where are we today with that? And also emerging, if you could comment on emerging markets. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Danielle. Alex here. Thank you for your question. First of all, look, we were overall pleased with the continued improved performance that we saw, particularly across our Hospital Medical Devices group. If you look at the Q4 performance for them, it was about 3.6%, which was one of their strongest quarters. And what we saw was really strong growth being driven by Interventional Solutions at over 14%. Our launch with CERENOVUS is almost a 20% growth. We saw really good performance in biosurgicals, up 9%; energy, up about 5%; and wound closure was up over 7%. We did see as well some modest improvement across the Orthopaedics group, particularly in trauma. That was up almost 2.5%, hips around 2% and, as mentioned earlier, also in our spine business. So regarding volumes themselves, we see -- of course, we don't have line of sight yet to all the Q4 data, but it would be our expectation that we would see continued slight improved trends coming out of Q3 overall. And we continue to see very strong performance in emerging markets and in BRIC. For the year, we had about 10% growth across all of our BRIC markets. And by the way, that was consistent across each one of our sectors. China and particularly -- remained particularly strong. In our Medical Device group, we were very pleased both in Hospital Medical Devices but also in our Vision Care business as well. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Alex. And Danielle, just to build on the procedures. In 3Q, we did see procedure increases, admission surgical procedures increasing about 1.5%. Lab procedures were about 1%, and we see that being relatively consistent. We don't see any major seasonal dynamics in any one particular area. So thank you for your question. Operator : Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Joe, one on the guidance and one product-related question. So Joe, the 2019 adjusted operational growth of 2% to 3% was a little below what we expected based on your public comments in Q4. So I want to understand the component. It sounds like you expect Consumer to accelerate or at least stay consistent with 2018 in 2019, and you expect Med Tech to accelerate versus 2018. So the implication is that Pharma is going to be about 2% at the midpoint in 2019, which is slightly below the market growth of, I think, 3% to 4% you said you could achieve in 2019 during your public comments in Q4. So is my math directionally accurate? And did something change since Q4? And then I'll just throw the product question in here. There were some changes to the leadership at Verb. Can you talk about the progress you're making with the surgical robot and Orthotaxy and remind us when you expect to launch? Is it -- I believe you said 2020 for both in the past. Joseph Wolk : Sure, Larry, and thanks for the question. So no, I don't think anything has fundamentally changed. Although we don't provide guidance by segment, qualitatively, I can say you're directionally correct. We do expect that the -- we have turned the corner in our Consumer business. If you look at the first half growth of about 1.5%, the second half growth of about 5%, we feel really good about the innovative products we have in premium Skin Care. The relaunch of our Baby franchise, as Chris noted in his prepared remarks, is off to a great start. In Medical Devices, we are expecting to see what we've seen throughout 2018, and that's improved quarterly upticks with respect to growth, getting us on that path to what we articulated at Analyst Day in May of being at or above the market in 2020. With Pharmaceuticals, again, I just really think it speaks to the tremendous strength and health of this business. If you think about a $3 billion to $3.5 billion headwind with respect to generic and biosimilar competition and we're still talking about growth, most companies would be talking about contraction, and the dialogue would be when you're going to get back to growth. It really speaks to the health of the business. And whether it's 2% or 3%, Larry, I think once this anniversary, we feel very confident about 2019. But it really portends very strongly for the future outlook of our company longer term. If you take those out, the base portfolio of Pharmaceuticals is still growing up to 2 to 3x the market, which it has done historically. And I can also say, it is a testament to the strength of the broad-based nature of Johnson & Johnson. This is not a statement we could have made a decade ago. So I feel good that we're talking about growth despite a $3 billion to $3.5 billion headwind. I'll turn it over to Alex to talk a little bit about our surgical platform. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Larry. Thanks for the question. Before I talk about Verb though, I'd just like to complement some of the comments that Joe made because we remain extremely excited about our business prospects as we head into 2019. And to put a bit of an exclamation point on Joe's comments, if you look at the underlying strength of our Pharma business, growing in excess of like almost 6%, 7% if we pull ZYTIGA out of it, the number of additional indications that we're going to have across our oncology and immunology platforms, the new product launches with both esketamine as well as erdafitinib that we're expecting this year, again, we think that sets us up not only for very strong performance in the face of significant headwinds in 2019, but also even more accelerated growth in 2020 and beyond. So we remain very confident and optimistic in those opportunities.  And I think consistent with what you've seen happen with us in past years, you'll see that play out as we go through the year. And we'll continue to provide updates as we deliver. Regarding Verb, look, we were just out there, and I had an opportunity to visit but -- myself, Ashley as well as Paul Stoffels, other members of the leadership team. And I think based upon our latest update, we feel frankly even more confident in the progress that we're seeing in this platform. That includes, yes, the robotics, what I'd call the front end, but also the great work that's taking place on the back end, on the system part of it that really represents the transition in robotics into digital surgery. And the progress that, that team has made, I think, over the last 12 months has been very strong. We believe we continue to be on track going forward. And as I mentioned several times, look, you're going to see continued news about our robotics platform over the course of 2020 and beyond. But what's so important about this is we're taking an outlook that digital surgery will be an important dynamic for the next 5, 10 and 15 years. And we want to make sure is that we get out in a timely manner but that we're also out in a manner that ensures we're competitive and ensures ultimately that we're making an even bigger difference in this area as we go forward. And the other aspect of it, which I think you mentioned, is the fact that having options and platforms in General Surgery, minimally invasive surgery but also orthopedics as well, we think is an additional benefit ultimately to the platform that we'll be rolling out. And look, regarding changes in the management team, what I would say is there have been changes in the management team, which we would expect as we begin to transition from a very early startup mode into a prepare-for-launch mode. And what we have done actually over the course of the last 3 months, 3 to 6 months, is bring in additional leadership into Verb that we feel have got the kind of capabilities, the backgrounds and the experiences to ensure that we're successful as we roll out this launch. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just one for Joe and then a follow-up for Alex. Joe, I just want to focus on margins for 2019. By our math, it looks like at the midpoint around 50, 60 basis points of margin expansion. Obviously, you're down from the significant expansion from 2018. But obviously, you have these Pharmaceutical headwinds that you've talked about. Can you help us sort of parse out the margin impact either from currency or from the Pharmaceutical headwinds in 2019? Or any color you could give us on sort of the underlying margin performance in '19 as it compares to 2018? Joseph Wolk : Yes. So David, I think that's an astute observation on your part that it isn't the margin expansion that we had in 2018. But again, given that our Pharmaceutical segment enjoys the best margins across all of our businesses and that growth is going to be moderated somewhat in 2019, I think it's a reasonable expectation. We want to continue like we always have to invest for the long term. So 2019 and delivering on these results are very important, but we also want to make sure we're well positioned for 2 to 5 years out as well. And so we're going to take that opportunity to do that. In terms of segment performance, you already have a Pharmaceutical sector that's best in class in terms of their overall margins. Medical Device is still at the top of the peer set as well. We want to continue to invest there to make sure we do accelerate and deliver on those plans to grow at or above market in 2020. And then in Consumer, I would say that's probably our biggest opportunity for margin improvement. We lag the peer set by a little bit there from the midpoint perspective. So we are looking at additional measures. In addition to just being an $80 billion company with the infrastructure, we'll look at some of the complementary services, such as finance, human resources, information technology, to make sure we're being not just effective there, but efficient as well. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. Now just 2 strategic questions for you. The first is your business on talc has been very clear. I just wonder if you'd help us understand this, do you expect any impact derivative to talc on the consumer franchise? And will it impact your strategic activity from an M&A perspective? And then somewhat related to that, I noticed that the Medical Device business moved down on your priority list last year versus this year, just help us understand the underlying driver of that. Alex Gorsky : Okay, David. Thanks a lot. Just one comment before I answer those questions. I want to pick up on Joe's former comment. I think what's really important about the way that we're managing the business, particularly in 2019, is to both ensure that we're continuing to invest in areas, frankly, that we think are important to our growth going forward while simultaneously managing our P&L in our business, we believe, in a very appropriate way. And so when it comes to additional deal opportunities, for example, the argenx deal with our Pharmaceutical group, we think that's a great investment. I think if you look at the track record of that group and the way that they've been able to perform, especially on those deals where we identify compounds like the CD 70 very early and then create multibillion-dollar platforms, reaching many, many patients with significant unmet need, we think that's a good investment for the future and the same thing in our Medical Device group. Our Medical Device group has, as Joe mentioned, been at the top of their peer group. But when it comes to investments in things like digital, in certain cases, David, as you well know, frankly, we need to improve our performance in other areas. So we have invested additional funds in areas as it relates to just straight-out execution in the field, both in the United States as well as abroad, in places like China. So we will continue to do that to make sure that we deliver in '19. But as important, maybe even more, that we deliver in '20, '21, '22 and beyond. Now as it relates to the other issue regarding the impact on talc, what I would say is it does not have an impact on our long-run strategic look at our Consumer business. And we still believe that there are a lot of good growth opportunities. I think we've demonstrated that in Q4 with the investment that we announced with Dr.Ci:Labo. There are many exciting areas, particularly in the areas like premium beauty, naturals. And by the way, the early signs around Zarbee's in our OTC group are very positive. So we think that those are positives. We're obviously watching the Baby relaunch very closely. As Chris mentioned in his earlier comments, the Johnson's Baby portion of our business was up 7%. And the negative results in Q4 overall for Baby are really related to some things, as he mentioned, regarding DESITIN and some other activities in Q4 of last year, but we're not seeing that in the core Baby performance. And what I would say overall in Medical Device, there is not a change in its ranking in terms of strategic importance. It remains a critical brand for us. As you know, we have over 12 platforms of $1 billion, and over 70% of those were #1 or #2 in the marketplace. I went through earlier areas that we were particularly pleased to see like EP, like biosurgery, like wound closure, energy, some areas in Ortho having positive signs back as well as our Vision Care business. But we realized that there's others that we've got to advance even faster, including robotics and others that we need to continue to turn around, such as the spine, sports, shoulders and other pockets of our business. So -- but we're confident in the leadership and the plans that we have for that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Actually, I have two of them. One of the things you repeatedly have talked about is improving your Orthopaedic franchise. You just rambled off spine, sports, shoulders and other pockets of the business. We have AAOS coming up. Could you please give us an idea of how you're approaching improving some of those? And how we would expect or what we should expect at AAOS? Alex Gorsky : Sure, Joanne. Thank you very much for the question. Look, there's a number of reasons why we believe we're going to see improving performance across this platform. Number one, it starts with our knee platform and the continued launch of ATTUNE Revision as well as cementless. We have several additional platforms that we're rolling out that we think will reinforce the profile not only here in North America, but as Chris mentioned earlier, we're seeing very good uptake with ATTUNE on a worldwide basis. And we also have some additional instrument sets that are being launched. And as you know, the cementless section of that market is growing faster. And so we remain confident that those launches are going to help reinforce that platform. In spine, we continue to focus on areas such as severe deformity, degeneration as well as the others. We have a number of new launches that we have coming out including the interbody cage. Biomaterials is an area that's of interest to us as well. In hips, we've continued to see strong performance. We have a few additional launches that we'll be announcing, and you'll be seeing more, particularly as it relates to the Anterior Approach. And as I mentioned, look, we still have some work to do in sports, shoulders and those areas. But we're also confident that, overall, with the 20 to 25 launchers that we'll have taking place in the course of 2018, many of those in the space were, frankly, that were done in the back end of 2018 as we head into '19 will enable us to continue that momentum. Joseph Wolk : Joanne, if I might add, too, that if you look a little bit longer term out, we also are looking forward to the addition of robotic digital capabilities there with our Orthotaxy platform in Orthopaedics. Joanne Wuensch : And then I wanted to spend a moment on the health program with the Apple Watches. I mean, can you think about or talk about how you plan on rolling them out, not just across AF but across other applications. Ultimately, I'm trying to get my head around, are people who wear the watch are going to walk in and say, \"Hey, I have x, y and z\"? Are physicians going to be handing this out? How do you see this moving into a commercialization stage and over what time frame? Alex Gorsky : Hey, Joanne. Thank you very much. Look, we're very excited about the partnership that we have with Apple in this area. And we think it does represent what we've been talking about for a while is that next step in introducing digital adaptation almost consumer level and how does that augment what we currently have across our Pharmaceutical, Medical Device as well as our Consumer area. I think it's safe to say that it's still early days, but here's an opportunity to better detect patients who either have the potential for AFib or are experiencing AFib and then, of course, longer term, how they respond to various treatments as well as other support programs that are helping to ensure compliance as well as broader wellness programs as well. So we think this, again, is going to be a great first step for us. We really appreciate the commitment and the time, the resources and the prioritization that Apple has placed on this and the way our teams have worked together. But look, we think that this is likely the first of many steps that you'll see not only in our Pharma space, but again, our Device as well as Consumer space in the years to come. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Joe, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the sales and EPS cadence for 2019. So for example, you're talking about reported sales for the full year in the range of down 1.5 to down 0.5. Should we be thinking in the first half down 2 or 3 and then positive growth as we enter the fourth quarter? And then EPS at the midpoint of your range is plus 5%. Should we be thinking flattish growth, EPS growth in the first half and then high single in the fourth quarter? And then just lastly, tying into all of this, a lot of our companies are telling us that the FX hit in the first quarter will be around 5% and maybe even 2% or 3% in the second quarter. Is that consistent with how you're viewing the FX impact in the first half of the year? Joseph Wolk : Yes. So Glenn, thanks for the question. We don't provide quarterly guidance. But what I would say is from an FX perspective, if you think about it, in the first 2 quarters of last year, I would think the average -- let's use the euro spot rate, it was about $1.20 to $1.22. Today, we're standing at something a little bit less than $1.14. So you would expect to see a more pronounced effect in terms of the reported results in the first half of the year. In terms of EPS, I wouldn't think it would be as stark as flat to high single digits, flat in the first half, high single digits in the second half, as you mentioned. I think it'd be a little bit more calibrated, again, a little bit softer in the first half but then a little bit strong in the second half as that spot rate, assuming today's rate holds, is pretty consistent. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Vamil Divan : So one, if you can maybe just provide a little more detail on that other income and expense line. I believe you mentioned is they provide $2 billion to $3 billion of income for the year. That's a little bit more than what we were estimating. So just a little more color on what you're already incorporating in there at the start of the year. And then again, maybe a little bit of sense of the quarterly breakdown would be very helpful given it's a fairly large number. And then on the Pharma side, just one question. You mentioned esketamine or erdafitinib that are both in front of the FDA. I know they both had breakthrough designation. I'm just wondering if you've seen any impact given the government shutdown on your interactions with the FDA over the past month. Or is there any sense that these reviews may take a little bit longer than you're previously estimating? Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Vamil. Thanks for the question. So with respect to other income, it's $2 billion, $2.3 billion is what we've guided at this point in time. That is the accounting which we capture royalty income, gains from equity investments we hold through Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. as well as any gains we might have related to divestitures. I would expect that, that would be more of a first half dynamic with respect to some of the divestitures that we have planned. The most notable one would be our sterilization products business, which should happen late first quarter, early second quarter. Again, that's just one component of the overall number. I will remind folks, too, that we have seen these levels in 2015 and 2017. And in the subsequent years, we're very cognizant of managing that. So we take the opportunity when we have other income that's at elevated levels to invest again in the long term, making sure that we're well positioned across all of our segments to influence health care in a positive way, which should result in a better return for shareholders.  With respect to the government shutdown, I would say, yes, esketamine and erdafitinib have breakthrough designation, certainly, with esketamine being a little bit more near term. The PDUFA date has not changed as of yet, so it's March 4. What we did receive information on recently was a delay of an ad board meeting. So we don't think that, that will impact the PDUFA date, but we are monitoring the situation closely. Obviously, the FDA, through their designation of breakthrough status for the drug, realizes the importance that this has for patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression, who really haven't had a new mechanism of action in better than a couple of decades now. So we hope that, that level of energy on both sides will carry through. We certainly hope both sides come together to reopen the government and end the partial shutdown, but we're monitoring it very closely. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : I just had a few quick ones. Joe, on the Pharma segment, J&J has previously used a number of novel contracting approaches, and this includes REMICADE and ZYTIGA. Are there opportunities for the broader portfolio in 2019? And specifically, how are you thinking about the payer approach this year to ERLEADA with generic ZYTIGA now in the market? And I have one follow-up for Alex. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff. I would say we're looking for contracts that make sense. As you know, we've got a very -- I would say best-in-class strategic customer group within our Pharmaceutical unit. We want to make sure that payers understand the value that our medications bring based on outcomes. So we'll continue to change our contracting with the landscape and want to influence how a payment occurs. Again, we do have some outcomes-based pilots out there that -- or across a number of therapeutic areas. We think that's a way that could potentially be a long-term solution. We certainly understand the conversation around pharmaceutical pricing. But again, I'll reiterate what I said earlier with respect to just our strong Pharmaceutical performance. We've got products that make a difference in patients' lives. It is better for the health care system overall, less costly to utilize those therapeutics. And our 8% growth this year was delivered even though we were able to decrease net price 6%. Geoffrey Meacham : Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, Joe or Alex, you guys have been very transparent on drug pricing. How viable do you think the Part D OUS reference pricing proposal really is? And do you feel like your assumptions on pricing across the portfolio per se later-stage products is conservative enough? Alex Gorsky : Geoff, thanks for the question. Look, we're obviously engaged with the administration and a lot of different groups right now in the issue of pharmaceutical pricing. We understand that it's important and it's critical for all of us to do things in a responsible way in this area. We do think that there are some changes around Part D and especially Part D as it relates to out-of-pocket costs that can and should be addressed to alleviate some of the current pressure in the system. Regarding the reference pricing, we do have some concerns with reference pricing overall. At the same time, what I would say is, we regularly track the pricing of our products on a global level, and we can tell you when you take a look at net pricing overall, we think that we're actually quite competitive. But again, we are concerned about unintended consequences around access and innovation as it relates to some of the proposals, but I think it's still early days. And look, we'll continue to work with the government and others to ultimately get the right outcome that ensures that we're going to continue to get a number of great breakthrough therapies at responsible prices and in a transparent and open way. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Geoff, and thanks, everyone, for the questions asked and for your continued interest in our company. Apologies for those that we couldn't get due to time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex for some closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : I just want to thank all of you again for your continued support and confidence in Johnson & Johnson. We're pleased with the performance that we were able to generate over the course of 2018, and we believe that we delivered on all of our priority commitments. But we're even more excited about 2019 for all the reasons that we just outlined and enumerated. So on behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you very much. And I look forward to engaging with all of you in the coming weeks and months. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter of 2019. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, I'm pleased to be joined by the leaders of our business segments who will participate in our Q&A session. Joining Joe and I here in New Brunswick are : Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2018 Form 10-K along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures, are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. We've made some enhancements to the earnings materials we posted on our website today, including an updated press release format and some additional information in the presentation that we think you will find helpful. These enhanced materials will also allow us to streamline and focus our comments on today's call with the goal of providing more time for engagement with management during the Q&A session. We hope you find these changes useful, and as always, we welcome any feedback so we can continue to provide you with the information in the most effective manner.  Regarding today's agenda, Joe will first provide some perspective on our overall results for the first quarter. I will then review the sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights on our cash position, capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2019 along with some considerations for the second quarter. The remaining time will be available for your questions, and we anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.  I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joseph Wolk : Great, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2019 and are confident in the health of our business. As you've heard us consistently say, our goal is to deliver solid financial and operational performance while also advancing innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers and consumers. During the first quarter, we demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver growth while also executing on our long-term strategies.  A few high-level comments about each of our segments prior to Chris providing additional franchise or product-level sales insights. Our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong growth across our immunology, oncology, neuroscience and pulmonary hypertension portfolios. The ongoing investments in our pipeline, coupled with our strong commercial execution around new product launches and line extensions, enable us to more than offset erosion from biosimilars and generics.  As you've heard us say in previous quarters, our global Pharmaceutical growth continues to be driven by volume rather than price, and we did experience another quarter of negative price. We recently issued our 2018 Janssen U.S. Transparency Report which is now available on our website. We led the industry by publishing this annual report 3 years ago, and we're proud to contribute to the information that health care providers, legislators and the general public can use to facilitate meaningful dialogue on the topic of health care costs.  In our Consumer segment, we remain focused on competitive growth. While we observed some broad market softness during the quarter, we are encouraged by our ability to garner share in key areas like OTC, where TYLENOL regained its status as the #1 brand of analgesics as well as NEUTROGENA and OGX within Beauty.  In the Medical Device segment, we continue to make progress on our stated goal of improved performance while continuing to enhance market-leading positions in many platforms. Additionally, in support of our long-term objectives for the segment, we are very excited about our recent acquisition of Auris Health which will enhance our digital surgery capabilities. The strength of our first quarter results reinforce the confidence we have in our broad-based business. We continue to manage our portfolio with discipline and make investments across the enterprise that position us well to achieve long-term sustainable growth across 3 vital aspects of health care.  I'll now turn the call back to Chris to discuss first quarter sales drivers as well as highlight notable line items in our P&L before I return with some comments regarding our cash position and guidance. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20 billion for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 0.1% versus the first quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.8 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.8%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth declined by 1.7%. OUS operational sales growth was 6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 7.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.5% worldwide: 3.1% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.39 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.60 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 representing increases of 0.5% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the first quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides that you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2018 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, growing at 2.2%. The overall market growth in the categories we participate in slowed to slightly over 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 0.7%. In addition to growing share in key brands, such as TYLENOL and NEUTROGENA, Consumer continues to grow share in the e-commerce channel, outpacing category growth rates in that channel with strong double-digit growth across all regions.  The Beauty franchise grew 3.6% or almost 1% adjusted for the impact of the Nizoral and RoC divestitures, along with the acquisition of Dr.Ci:Labo, including its portfolio of dermocosmetic beauty products.  Priority brands within the franchise continue to deliver strong performance, with both OGX and Maui Moisture, along with NEUTROGENA delivering above-market growth globally, with sales growth of over 4%. NEUTROGENA in the U.S. is growing share across all major categories, including facial cleansing and moisturizing treatment, acne treatment and sun protection, while OUS sales growth was strong across multiple regions driven by new launches. OGX and Maui Moisture brands continue to experience strong growth in mature markets in addition to benefiting from new market expansions.  Over-the-counter medicines grew 5.5% globally or 3% when adjusting for the impact of the Zarbee's acquisition which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC share growth is well outpacing the category, led by TYLENOL which grew by over 15%, including 10% consumption growth driven by rapid-release gel and TYLENOL arthritis products. The balance of growth was mainly associated with inventory builds as a result of the prior year's supply constraints driven by Hurricane Maria.  OUS grew almost 3% with strong sales in Asia driven by the strong performance of NICORETTE Quickmist in our smoking cessation portfolio, MOTRIN for pediatric analgesics, and RHINOCORT for allergy. Growth was partially offset by declines in our upper respiratory brands due to soft cold/cough flu season in Northern Europe and Russia.  Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care declined 7.4% globally. U.S. declines occurred primarily in AVEENO driven by channel shifts and market softness, while the declines outside of the U.S. are primarily due to retail destocking as the Johnson's baby relaunch expands into new markets. The Johnson's baby brand has been relaunched in 4 key markets and is growing in 3 of these markets : China, India and Canada. The U.S. experienced a modest decline consistent with the overall market decline.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.2 billion grew 7.9%, enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. Sales were aided by some onetime U.S. pricing favorable adjustments worth almost 200 basis points worldwide. These were primarily driven by prior-period adjustments in the quarter for STELARA and INVOKANA along with the prior year comparable for REMICADE that we highlighted in the first quarter last year. Even when adjusting for these items, we delivered above-market performance globally.  Sales increased in the U.S. by 4.3% and outside the U.S. by 12.2%. The aforementioned pricing adjustment impacted U.S. growth by just over 300 basis points reducing our U.S. growth to approximately 1%. This slower growth was primarily driven by our first full quarter of generic competition for ZYTIGA. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at competitive levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds.  Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.5%. DARZALEX continued its stellar performance growing about 51% globally. The U.S. grew 33% and continues to benefit from strong market growth and a 4-point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX grew 18% and is experiencing increased penetration and share gains across Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and in the 40 EMEA countries where it is commercially available with 9 new markets added this quarter.  IMBRUVICA grew over 40% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. and strong uptake outside the U.S. in the European and Asia-Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on fourth quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 2 points of market share and is the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia which gained over 5 points of market share in line 1 therapy.  Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 15%, with declines of 55% in the U.S. driven by generic competition which was partially offset by 21% growth outside the U.S. Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which gained 4 points of market share, with the penetration of prescribers split evenly among urology and oncology practices.  Further, we are very pleased to have received approval for BALVERSA last week for the treatment of adults with locally or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. BALVERSA is the first FGFR kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA.  Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just under 10% driven by continued strong performance in STELARA with operational growth of 36%, primarily from the Crohn's disease indication, partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 19% due to increased discounts and modest share loss to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. REMICADE has maintained approximately 92% of the infliximab volume share. The previously mentioned prior-period pricing adjustments for REMICADE and STELARA had a favorable impact on their growth by about 400 and 500 basis points, respectively, resulting in underlying global performance of a 23% decline in REMICADE and 31% growth of STELARA. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease where market share has increased by approximately 8 points in the U.S. compared to the first quarter of 2018.  Lastly, sales for our recently launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA, totaled $217 million globally. TREMFYA is experiencing strong demand with over 31,000 patients on therapy and achieved a 6.9% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S. which is up 4 points from the first quarter of 2018.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well growing 17% with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, SPRAVATO was approved by the FDA in March as the first new mechanism of action in decades for treatment-resistant depression. We are excited that more than 475 treatment centers have been certified as of first quarter, and our first patient has been dosed.  We did experience declining sales of 9.5% in our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in XARELTO, INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share growth. However, this growth was offset by the increase in the legislative rate for the doughnut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and doughnut-hole utilization resulting in an overall decline in XARELTO of 6% this quarter.  We've seen a positive response to XARELTO's new 2.5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. And while we expect the penetration of this expanded patient population to occur over time, we are confident in the value this indication provides to patients.  Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by double digits increasing by about 15%. We realized strong growth in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 17% and 43%, respectively, on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. As expected, TRACLEER is declining due to increased use of OPSUMIT as well as generic competition in Europe.  I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.5 billion, declining 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.3% worldwide, an acceleration versus fourth quarter of 2018. The adjusted operational sales growth was driven by continued strong performance in Interventional Solutions, Vision and Advanced Surgery.  Interventional Solutions grew about 18% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving more than 18% growth worldwide, continuing its trend of double-digit growth. We continue to be the market leader in this underpenetrated market and gained 1 full point of market share in 2018. Our Q1 growth was driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Additionally, we realized robust growth in our CERENOVUS business with double-digit growth globally driven by new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth.  Strong Vision results of 5% were driven by contact lenses, which grew 6% globally on the strength of the daily disposables and astigmatism lenses in the OASYS family. At the end of the quarter, we were also excited to announce the availability of ACUVUE OASYS with TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY for the U.S. market. This first-of-its-kind photochromic contact lens was named one of TIME magazine's best inventions in 2018 and seamlessly adapts to changing light, delivering more effortless sight with less squinting from dawn to dusk. Orthopaedics continues to close the gap versus the market with operational sales growth of 0.8% globally, delivering its fifth straight quarter of sequential improvement. Hips grew 2.7%, which we expect to represent performance in line with the market in the U.S. and share gains outside the U.S., primarily in the Asia-Pacific region driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS.  Trauma growth of over 1% globally was driven by market growth, supported by strong adoption of newer innovations, such as our Femoral Recon Nails. The U.S. growth rate accelerated versus the fourth quarter of 2018 to 2.5%. We also experienced strong growth in Asia. However, we saw declines in EMEA, primarily driven by the timing of tender offers which impacted our growth outside the U.S. by approximately 150 basis points.  Spine declined 1%, however, continues to improve overall performance with its fourth straight quarter of improved adjusted operational results. We continue to see stabilization of performance driven by new products, such as the VIPER PRIME system for minimally invasive surgery and EXPEDIUM VERSE, our all-in-one pedicle screw system for deformity.  Knees declined by almost 2% in the quarter. While U.S. sales declined, we improved our performance for the fourth straight quarter driven by uptake of the ATTUNE Revision system. Sales declines outside the U.S. occurred in EMEA and were partially offset by continued growth in Asia and Latin America.  Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopaedics but was relatively stable overall compared to the fourth quarter. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 4% in spine, negative 3% in hips, negative 2.5% in trauma and negative 2% in knees.  We were very pleased with the results for the surgery business. The Advanced Surgery performance of almost 6% growth globally was led by biosurgery with growth of approximately 10% along with strong performance in endocutters at 5% and energy at over 3%. Biosurgery strength was driven by strong demand aided by new innovation, such as SURGICEL powder. Endocutters and energy performance is primarily driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region fueled by continued adoption of newer innovation.  In General Surgery, wound closure grew 4% as barbed and Plus Sutures are experiencing strong adoption. Selling days did not have a significant impact on our global growth rates in the first quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact in any subsequent quarter in 2019. As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends for the fourth quarter of 2018. Hospital admissions increased by 1% with lab procedures up about 0.5%. Surgical procedures were slightly positive. Our preliminary estimates for the first quarter of 2019 indicate a slight decline in trend in both hospital admissions and lab procedures with growth of 0.5% and flat, respectively. Surgical procedures growth in the first quarter is expected to increase to close to 1.5%.  I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2019, please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 first quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.9 billion on an after-tax basis primarily driven by intangible amortization of $0.8 billion and an IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion, which is related to the write-down of the IPR&D asset from the acquisition of Alios Biopharma. Excluding the net impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.10, an increase of 1.9% versus the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.18, up 5.8% versus the first quarter of 2018.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Both cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter slightly improved primarily driven by favorable segment mix. We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels, and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 14.3%, which is higher than the first quarter 2018 by over 200 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical milestone payments including the $300 million milestone payment to argenx associated with our worldwide license and collaboration agreement as well as higher investments in our overall portfolio. Net interest expense was lower by $142 million as a result of higher rates of interest earned as well as lower average debt balances.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, our tax rate of 15.2% includes adjustments relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will be further highlighted in the tax footnote of the 10-Q. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.6% compared to 17.8% in the same period last year and is consistent with our expectations of the full year adjusted effective tax rate.  Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise was consistent with the first quarter of 2018. Looking at the adjusted before tax income by segment. Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 480 basis points primarily driven by increased investments in R&D spend. Consumer margins improved by 700 basis points primarily driven by the gain related to the company's earlier investment in Ci :z Holdings. Medical Devices were essentially flat, improving 30 basis points versus last year.  That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the first quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.  I will now turn the call back to Joe. Joseph Wolk : Thanks, Chris. With respect to cash, at the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt. A few comments about how we allocated capital in the first quarter, where once again we simultaneously executed across the 4 tenets of our strategy to create shareholder value. Reinvestment in our business continues to be a top priority at Johnson & Johnson. We invested $2.9 billion in R&D in the quarter which represents a 230 basis point increase. This was primarily driven by milestone payments and other investments to advance assets in our pipeline.  In M&A, as we previously announced, we strengthened our Consumer business with the acquisition of Dr.Ci:Labo. In addition to R&D and M&A spending, we also used cash in the quarter to continue returning value to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, totaling $2.4 billion in the quarter. Our dividend will continue to be a key priority going forward. We also made progress on our share repurchase program in the first quarter with another $900 million of the total $5 billion authorization. We are now 36% complete.  Now let me provide a few comments on the updates to our guidance for 2019, which we noted in this morning's press release. Our first quarter results have elevated our confidence in our performance, strengthening the outlook for our operational sales growth. As a result, we are increasing our guidance by 50 basis points, reflecting full year adjusted operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. The negative impact of translational currency, however, has increased, but we plan to absorb that impact with the strength of our operational sales outlook I just referenced. Therefore, our expectation for total reported sales in 2019 remains the same. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but in light of my previous comments, our reported sales estimate for the year remains at minus 1.5% to minus 0.5%, utilizing an average euro spot rate of $1.12 versus the $1.14 referenced back in January. Now turning to other guidance items that we have updated, starting with other income and expense, which is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from items such as litigation investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We are increasing our full year expectations for other income, excluding special items, by $400 million to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion for the year. Within other income, one of the largest items that we previously announced is the successful closing of the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business, which has closed and will be reflected in the second quarter results.  All of these factors add to our confidence in the business, and as a result, we are increasing the high end of the range for adjusted operational EPS by $0.03 per share, and we are also tightening the range, reflecting an increase of $0.05, bringing the midpoint to $8.78 per share. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements. However, the estimated negative impact of currency on EPS increased $0.05 and is now estimated to be $0.20 for the year, resulting in adjusted EPS in the range of $8.53 to $8.63 per share. All other items of guidance remain consistent with what we provided in January.  The strength of our business reflected in the quarter makes us even more confident in the guidance we just provided and enables us to absorb the impact to EPS of incremental currency headwinds and our investment in Auris Health. Additionally, our higher level of expected other income provides the flexibility to deploy higher levels of investment to fortify and accelerate our pipelines as you saw on our elevated level of R&D spend in the first quarter.  In summary, in light of last year's 210 basis point improvement in operating margins and this year's EPS growth to sales growth ratio, coupled with other capital deployment, Johnson & Johnson continues to create a compelling value proposition for investors. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, as with last quarter, we'd like to provide you with a few qualitative factors to consider in your modeling. Here's what we know or expect for the second quarter of 2019. Our divestiture of our Advanced Sterilization Products business closed on April 1, 2019, and as noted earlier, this comprises a large majority of the other income for 2019. Given that divestiture, we will have minimal Advanced Sterilization Products sales in the second quarter. We also expect that currency will still be a headwind in the second quarter, but not as significant as experienced in the first quarter. And finally, looking back, the second quarter of 2018 represented the highest sales quarter in the year, so you might anticipate a more challenging year-over-year comparison, particularly as we expect some of the generic and biosimilar erosion in our Pharmaceutical segment to potentially accelerate.  That concludes our overview of the first quarter performance. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we are very pleased with our solid first quarter results, but we are also unrelenting in our pursuit of growth, meeting patient needs and driving value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders.  Before I hand the call back over to Chris, let me take a moment to thank in advance Ashley, Jennifer and Thibaut for being part of this call and to welcome Thibaut to his first Johnson & Johnson earnings call. Thibaut is a seasoned global leader who has lived and worked on 5 continents across all 3 segments of Johnson & Johnson's business in his 19 years with the company. Prior to his new role, Thibaut served as the leader of the Johnson & Johnson Consumer Asia-Pacific region. It's great to have you all here.  I'll now turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A portion. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : One for Ashley and one for Joe. Ashley, can you talk about the Auris deal and your surgical robot? What's the plan for rolling out Monarch? How long do you think it will take to integrate Neuwave onto that platform? And I think the price paid made some people feel it was a hedge for the Verb joint venture, because Auris also has a surgical robot in development. So can you confirm that you still plan to launch your surgical robot in 2020? And Joe, just -- I'll ask my second question up front for you. The $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in other income, can you talk about how that might create a headwind to EPS growth in 2020? How you're thinking about that line item going forward? Joseph Wolk : Go ahead, Ashley. Ashley McEvoy : Okay. Great. Thanks, Larry, for the question. Listen, we're very pleased to welcome Auris to the J&J family. Just spent some time with them last week at close and to really welcome Dr. Fred Moll, who many of you know is a true pioneer in the field of robotics. We view the acquisition of Auris as highly complementary to our Verb program as well as our Orthopaedics program in Orthotaxy. And what I'm very excited about is the for-revenue product of Monarch. You know all of us as a world leader in open surgery and a world leader in laparoscopic surgery. I'm pleased to share that we're now for revenue in endoluminal surgery, and we plan to take advantage of the world-class robotics expertise, advanced instrumentation our partnership with Verily of creating a connected experience and then, clearly, our very robust global infrastructure to have a very competitive value proposition in the field of digital surgery. Thanks for the question, Larry. Joseph Wolk : Great. With respect to the other income number for this year, the new ranges, if you look at the upper end, pretty much on par with what we experienced in 2015. And then in 2016, we had elevated sales growth, and we were able to manage that. As we look towards 2020, we would have the same intentions in mind. So as we anniversary some of the generic or biosimilar erosion later this year, that provides a tailwind into 2020's top line growth. Additionally, we have a number of, I'd say, cost improvement initiatives throughout the organization, most notably in supply chain. We announced a little bit earlier a partnership with Jabil. That's going extremely well. And we use these funds really as a flexibility to invest. So we just spoke about Auris and the investment there. That would have been otherwise dilutive, all things being equal, but we were able to absorb that with the strength of the first quarter and some of the other income proceeds that we think we're going to have throughout the course of 2019. So it's not lost on us, Larry, that we need to manage towards that and provide the consistency in terms of earnings growth that has become expected of Johnson & Johnson. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple for me. Joe, I'll start with you and then maybe one for Ashley. Joe, just want to talk about the guidance here for the year. So you're raising guidance earlier in the year than you did last year. So it's an expression of kind of confidence in the year. So what is driving sort of your confidence this early in the year to raise the guidance? And as you talked about the factors which you should expect for 2019, what's changed your mind? Is pharma stronger; Consumer, a little weaker? These broad themes across the segments, does that all still hold? And what's providing the incremental confidence? Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, David, for the question. Yes, and we are much more confident at this point in the year than maybe we were a year ago and certainly for the balance of 2019, what we thought would occur in January. If you recall, in the January discussion that we had, we forecasted a range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion of generic biosimilar erosion. Probably, the higher end of that range, just based on first quarter results, has subsided a little bit, so it's probably closer to the $3 billion number. It's also, though, attributable to the strengths of the core products. So DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA just having tremendous impact on patients, on the health care system overall, and that's translating into good business for Johnson & Johnson.  With Medical Devices, I think we've gotten to that number that begins with a 4, which we've been striving for. And obviously, we're looking for better performance moving forward. But we got there pretty quickly, if you think about where we were in the fourth quarter, about 3.3% I'll call it unadjusted or adjusted growth, leading up to 4.3%. That gives us a little bit more confidence. And so we saw, while there's still more work to do in U.S. Orthopaedics, a quarter of growth, which is a positive sign. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. And then Ashley, just on the devices, 2 questions here : First is off Larry's question on Auris. When can the investor kind of expect to see a prototype platform? And can you just update us on any regulatory terms, either U.S. or ex U.S.? Can we still think about early 2020 as the first global approval in some market? And then another question, just on Recon, Ashley, just coming off AAOS. Ortho performance is getting better, but the Recon performance took a small step backward this particular quarter. How much of that do you think is attributable to changes in market growth this quarter relative to share dynamics in a worldwide new franchise? Ashley McEvoy : Sure. Thanks, David, for the questions. With Auris, the real value is that we actually, as I mentioned their first-generation Monarch, we are for revenue in endoluminal. And we have a lung program at J&J, which is really about preventing, intercepting and curing lung cancer, which is one of the top cancers. And a lot of it is because people get diagnosed at end -- at late stage, where you have -- 18% have a 5-year survival rate. So early detection makes a big deal for better outcomes. And so Monarch will be a really nice enabler of early diagnosis, accessing the very distal parts of the lung for better diagnosis. And you can imagine to Larry's earlier question, really we have an active development program of bringing in potential treatments like ablation or potential dispersal of oncolytic viruses. So that's really generation 1.  You mentioned another area that we're assessing, obviously, is digital surgery for broader indications in General Surgery as well as in Orthopaedics. And again, I would say we view the Auris acquisition as highly complementary to our Verb program. I was at Verb just last week, and I'm pleased with how they're knocking down risk every day. They have completed all preclinical procedural developments for several procedures. They've engaged with hundreds of surgeons. They're engaging right now with notified bodies on the regulatory pathways. So I would say, stay tuned. We're going to take the best insight from Dr. Fred Moll and really have him assess both of these programs and make sure that we have a highly differentiated value proposition at launch. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : My first one's a broader one on the pharma market. I'd just be interested in your views on Medicare Part D reform and a potential shift away from drug rebates over time. I guess specifically, how do you think about the potential change to Part D as it relates to J&J? And longer term, do you see the broader U.S. market including the commercial market, moving more towards a net pricing dynamic versus this current kind of gross price and rebate structure as we think about, let's say, the next 3 to 5 years?  My second question was on TREMFYA. Just a little bit more color in terms of how you're seeing the competitive landscape in psoriasis shaping up as we think about IL-23s, IL-17s and the TNFs. As well as how you're thinking about AbbVie's risankizumab launch later this year as you think about your kind of positioning within the IL-23s? Jennifer Taubert : Chris, it's Jennifer. The first piece -- the first part of your question, Chris, was really around Medicare Part D and rebate reform. And as we take a look at it, we're really supportive of rebate reform and finding ways to actually get those dollars in discounts and rebates actually back to the patient. Out-of-pocket costs, as you know, are really one of the things that are causing a lot of pain in the marketplace right now. And so we're supportive of the administration's efforts on rebate reform, and we're taking a look at how we can actually implement that in a pretty rapid way. So it's going to depend on what ultimately comes out, but we're looking at it closely and believe that we'll be well poised to be able to move into the marketplace following sort of new market dynamics with rebate reform. We really look forward to patients being able to have more affordable out-of-pocket costs.  In terms of TREMFYA, we had a really terrific quarter with TREMFYA with $217 million globally. As we've talked about the product, it's performing really well on the market. And all of our clinical data and comparative data continue to reinforce what we're seeing, and this is really being a true leading brand in psoriasis. So as you recall, we've got head-to-head superiority versus Humira. We got superiority versus STELARA in patients with -- that are STELARA-inadequate responders. And most recently, we've announced our data that shows superior efficacy versus Cosentyx at PASI 90 at 48 weeks. And so we've really been able to demonstrate that the product performs not only rapidly for patients but that it's got great durability as well. And both together are what's most important to both providers as well as to patients.  I think importantly, as well, we now have data out through 3 years, demonstrating really consistency of effect and believe that, that's going to be good for us whether we're competing versus the IL-17, whether we're competing versus the old anti-TNF or whether we're competing against the upcoming IL-23s that are coming. So we've got a very a strong portfolio of data there to help us continue to succeed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : I'd like to turn just for a moment to expense items and the headwinds that you'll be seeing in the Pharmaceutical business throughout the rest of the year. How should we think about the impact on the gross margins? Joseph Wolk : Joanne, this is Joe. First of all, let me just say nice job on TV this morning. You did great. Well, I'll say with expense one, I would go to our guidance where we say we will see slight improvement. We'll always look for opportunities to invest. But I think a slight improvement is where we're targeting for this year. Remember last year, we improved about 210 basis points on operating margins, and then given the current EPS growth rate to sales growth ratio, we think that's extremely healthy. So we're going to look for areas to invest. While we have these other cost initiatives, I would say, closer to their infancy, the supply chain one that I mentioned in my earlier reply is just getting started. We'll start to see the impact of that in 2020 and beyond. Joanne Wuensch : Terrific. And as my second question. I just want to drill down a little bit more on knees because that one seems to be one of the components in Orthopaedics that's lagging somewhat, and we have not just one but two robotic knee systems on the market. How do we think about that turning before your own system arrives at the end of next year? Ashley McEvoy : Thank, Joanne. This is Ashley. Thanks for the question. And David, forgive me, I wasn't answering knees. But I would say that we consider our performance in knees as stabilizing. We posted a 2% decline in the quarter. It was down about 2% in the United States which is pretty consistent with prior quarters. We did experience a decline OUS predominantly driven by EMEA, which included really due to predominantly onetimers. So we would say stable. What we're committing to do is really get the news out about ATTUNE's knee performance. We've got 5-year data now in 4 registries. So we're getting the news out at the congresses. I think you saw that in Las Vegas. Our ATTUNE Revision is performing quite well. It's up 10%, and we plan to launch our cementless offering later this year. And then, clearly, I think if you were in Las Vegas, you saw a peak at our robotics offering at the AAOS. And that combination, we believe, is what will eventually get us to above-market performance. In the interim, we will be challenged until we get our cementless out there, we get our robot out there. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Ashley. Maybe just to build on Ashley's comment, we would have experienced positive growth OUS. That comp she referenced was worth a little over 250 basis points, just to put that in context for you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Hopkins : Just two quick questions. First, Joe, I just wanted to clarify the guidance increase on revenue growth of 50 basis points. Is that basically the net of -- what you just talked about was the $3 billion to $3.5 billion headwind being a little bit better, strong core pharma growth, and then obviously, also the price increase in pharma that you talked about? Are those the things that are different in the quarter in the guidance? Joseph Wolk : So Bob, I would say, that's largely it. I'm not sure you referenced to a price increase. We actually experienced a price decrease again in the quarter overall, other than the PPA adjustment that Chris referenced in his commentary. So it is a stronger outlook with respect to the pharmas group, driven by the core portfolio as well as those products not being as impacted as quickly. With respect to generics and biosimilar erosion, I'd say Medical Device is probably a tick stronger than we thought back in January. And in Consumer, we're continuing to monitor. Again, we feel very good about the share levels that we attained, and we do think there might be a slight market contraction. And I don't know, maybe, Thibaut, you can speak to that for -- with a few words? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Absolutely, Joe. We saw in the first quarter a contraction of the market compared to what we experienced in the second half of 2018. Looking into 2019, we expect the market to be down a little bit. But our estimate for the full year growth of the market in which we compete is around 2% for the full year. Joseph Wolk : Yes. And just to maybe put some further context around those numbers, Bob. It was about 1.1% growth in the quarter for the categories in which we compete. The second half of last year is closer to 2.5% to 2.7%. So we did see a deceleration. We'll see if it's temporary or something that's much more sustainable. Do you have another question, Bob? Robert Hopkins : Yes. Just one quick one. One question on Vision care, which sort of stood out as a positive result in the quarter. I'm just curious was the better contact lens growth in Q1 in your view more market related or market share related. And I'm just wondering if you could provide any color on the new contact lens that you're referring to in terms of just putting it in perspective for us of how meaningful maybe increasing growth that could drive for that franchise. Ashley McEvoy : Sure. Thanks, Bob. It's Ashley. We have to get you to try our new OASYS TRANSITIONS with light management. A lot of our baseball players in opening season have started to use it. But yes, we're pleased with our performance in contact lenses, as I mentioned about 6%. It's had about 3 years of consistent above-market performance. Very strong OUS performance as well in contact lens, and really innovation has been driving that. So the market has been healthy. We've been performing a bit above the market, so we've been gaining market share in our contact lens business. And really, emerging markets is driving that as well as innovation and meaningful innovation in some of the developed markets. And I think we just shared that we just completed Phase III trials for our allergy, our drug-eluting contact lens with an antihistamine. So we expect that to come to market in 2020. Operator : Next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVP Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : I just want to follow up on some of the questions around the updated guidance. I mean, you came -- it seems like the momentum was sustained versus Q4 on this with a whole quarter of ZYTIGA. And I understand, Joe, what you said about there are some things that got a little bit better, some things that have posted maybe incrementally a little bit worse, i.e., on the Consumer side. But it feels like -- and I appreciate comps get harder as we move through the year. But the -- it looks like the guidance suggests still a meaningful step-down on that operational adjusted sales growth number. And so I guess, I'm just pushing a little bit. It sounds like is it right to read your updated guidance as you're updating partially for the outperformance that we saw in Q1. But maybe this gives you a little bit more confidence of the potential upside because, again, the deceleration suggest that from here, after what was a pretty strong Q1, I would argue is pretty significant. So just trying to get a little bit more from you on what's reflected there. Joseph Wolk : Okay, Danielle. So we are more confident than what we were in January. That should be clear with the guidance. In terms of further confidence, we'll see how the year unfolds. Some things that we haven't mentioned yet is one, ZYTIGA, while we held on pretty good for a small molecule in the first quarter, given usual erosion rates, we do expect that to accelerate. And recall, that's going to be a comparison against a brand that was growing throughout 2018. You also have TRACLEER and VELCADE that will probably see generics in the coming months. And PROCRIT has had some activity in terms of erosion, but the competitor or the generic entry there had some manufacturing entries which have now been remediated, as we understand. So we're taking all those into account in the guidance we're providing today. Danielle Antalffy : And a quick follow-up on the Consumer side of things. Just wondering, it seems like Q1 tends to be -- and maybe I'm misremembering, but seems like Q1 tends to have been a little bit weak for you guys in the past. Is there some dynamic in the market that has changed that causes the softer Q1 versus the back half of the year? It sounds like you're calling out more market contraction versus anything J&J-specific. Any color there? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Thank you for the question, Danielle. It's true that each quarter is different in the Consumer business due to macro factors and also the seasonality of our business. So our Q1 result can be affected, for example, by the season in cold and flu segments. This year, we saw soft cold and flu seasons in some parts of the world, and that can have an impact on the quarter. That's what happened in Q1, for example. So yes, macro and seasonal effects have an impact on the quarter-to-quarter performance. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Joshua Jennings : Two for Jennifer. Just first on esketamine, thanks for some of the details on the prepared remarks by Chris. I wonder if you could give any incremental color. I think you mentioned 475 centers are already certified, first dose to a patient provided in the commercial setting. Anything else you can help share? And maybe just to start with, just as one trigger, Jennifer, how should we think about the centers certification ramp going over the course of 2019 and into 2020? Any other color you can share?  And then the second question is just on cardiovascular and other. XARELTO, appreciate the details on the doughnut hole and the decline in Q1, but there's some positive things on the horizon there including the filing for prevention of DVT in medically ill patients. But just what's the outlook there for XARELTO in terms of returning to growth? And then lastly, in the same category, INVOKANA, any expectations in terms of whether the CREDENCE data can turn that franchise around? Jennifer Taubert : Thanks. So yes, we received approval and launched SPRAVATO, which is esketamine, in the first quarter, and that was following the breakthrough therapy designations. And so it was approved for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression along with an oral antidepressant in patients who've tried 2 or more antidepressant therapies in that current episode. The product is also available with a REMS program, as anticipated. And as part of that REMS program, it requires that we do certify the sites. And then we also enroll patients in the REMS program prior to administration.  So the interest in SPRAVATO has been really high, and that is across insurance plans, providers as well as patients. And actually, a quick update. I know we spoke about the 465 center certification earlier today, but the number -- I just got some new numbers. It's actually up as high as 800 sites that have now been certified and are approved to begin treating patients. Importantly, we've actually got a number of patients who have actually been dosed with the product and some that actually have had multiple doses successfully. So we believe that we're off to a very, very strong start with SPRAVATO, and that it is going to be an important growth driver for us.  The sites, because of the REMS program, are an important component. That's where the patients will need to go for treatment. And right now, with that number up as 800 sites already certified, we're well on track with our plans for the year there. So looking forward to being able to hopefully treat a large number of patients with SPRAVATO to help them with their treatment-resistant depression. So early days still. Realize that it's only been on the market a few weeks, but we're very encouraged by the signs that we're seeing.  If we then move over to XARELTO. So XARELTO, both TRxs and share grew in the first quarter. But unfortunately, that growth was offset by the increase in doughnut-hole expenses that moved from 50% to 70% and also, a greater percentage of patients that were in Medicare and Medicaid, which are the most heavily discounted channels.  If I give you a little bit more of the dynamics in what's going on underneath all of that and, hopefully, reasons for belief of success of the asset going forward. The CAD/PAD launch is going very well. And the launch is really consistent or even better than launch benchmarks that we had with such products like ENTRESTO or BRILINTA, that have been proven to be very successful in the market. We've seen very positive response to the 2.5 milligram vascular dose that we launched, and we do really expect this to be a significant contributor for us going forward. As a reminder, there's about 13 million patients that have CAD/PAD. While we're starting in a subset, there is extraordinary need for products like XARELTO in patients that have CAD/PAD. Additionally, we filed for medically ill. We filed an sNDA at the end of December based on our MARINER and MAGELLAN trials and look forward to hopefully getting approval and being able to launch that indication in the U.S. in 2019. And then last on INVOKANA. INVOKANA, we just recently reported the results of our CREDENCE study, showing that the product significantly reduces the risk of renal failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This is a 30% reduction of the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease with just things like dialysis, transplant, doubling of serum creatinine or renal and cardiovascular death, so really, really robust results. There are also further secondary end points that were extraordinarily positive in that study.  We plan to work with the regulators to get an indication along those lines, and then to also work with payers to see if we've got the opportunity to enhance our formulary positions and get this product available for more patients. We've been limited because of some of the safety labeling for the product and that, that's impacted it. We're hopeful that the CREDENCE data in bringing that forward is another opportunity for patients. We'll help work to try to shift that balance and perceptions around the benefit risk profile. Operator : Next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Just have a few. In PAH, we're coming up on two 2 years post-closing Actelion. So just curious, when we think about the UPTRAVI trajectory, are there commercial drivers, say, geographically or share, that are notable for the next year? So maybe how is that different than your original expectation? And then, Joe, in pharma this year, you talked about the headwinds from generics and biosimilars. The new launches may take some time or change the growth profile back to what you guys view as above market. So maybe at a higher level, would you view 2019 as a trough? Or is there risk that you think the deceleration in pharma could persist going into 2020? Jennifer Taubert : I'll go ahead and start off on Actelion. So our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by double digits in the first quarter, so an increase of 15%. But if you go a little bit deeper on that together, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI delivered over $500 million in sales. And OPSUMIT had growth of 17%, and UPTRAVI had growth of 43%. So we do think that UPTRAVI is a significant driver for that business for us going forward. And also, as we anticipated when we did the deal originally, the strong growth that we're seeing with UPTRAVI is really coming from a few different areas : continued share gains, but also greater market penetration and earlier use.  I believe as we put our commercial capabilities across these assets and with UPTRAVI being the newest one, we continue to get approval and get not only registration but access to reimbursement for the asset globally, which is having a lift. We're selling the product in as really the first oral PRA and really trying to drive earlier and earlier usage in the PAH treatment continuum, because we believe the best thing for patients is more aggressive treatment and earlier on in therapy. And so it's really showing in the results that we've seen and with that 43% growth. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Jennifer. And then, Geoff, to answer your second question, in terms of a trough. I would say 2019 is when we would expect the largest impact from generic or biosimilar erosion. That's why we were so specific in January to outline that impact. We'll continue to see great core growth. If you look at immunology, STELARA still has market opportunities within Crohn's disease as well as some other indications. TREMFYA, most patients on psoriasis are still not treated with a biologic, so we've got a great opportunity there. Oncology will still be significant with IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. And remember outside the U.S., we still have ZYTIGA exclusivity, so we're in good shape there, the Actelion assets that Jennifer just referenced and the XARELTO indications. So I would see 2019 as a trough, and once we anniversary some of these patent losses, we should be even stronger than we were in the first quarter and back to that well above-market projection for Pharmaceutical. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vamil Divan of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Vamil Divan : So just a couple, if I could. One high-level one on pharma, and following up on Chris' earlier question around rebate reform. And I guess I'm -- just the question I'm getting at, and I think investors are also wondering about, is how to think about the actual list prices if the safe harbor is removed from Part D. So is it safe to assume that the list price will come down to where net prices currently are? Or is it possible that the list prices may end up at higher price than where the net prices currently are in the market?  And then my second question, just a specific one. I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But in terms of REMICADE and the biosimilar impact, can you just share what percentage of the infliximab market you still have with the brand? Jennifer Taubert : Sure. Why don't I start off... Chris DelOrefice : Let me look that one up, as you start with the first question. Jennifer Taubert : Okay. I was going to say on the REMICADE one. I know I've got that one. So we are continuing to see erosion of REMICADE, as expected. But if we take a look, our team has been really competing in the marketplace to try to ensure that patients who would like to stay on REMICADE have the access and the availability to do so. And right now, we've been able to retain about 92% of the volume share for infliximab, but obviously, albeit at a lower and a very competitive price in the market.  In terms of rebate reform, I think we're going to have to wait and see what ultimately is going to come forward in terms of the rebate rule. There are some options that could include patients essentially having some of that rebate flow through at the pharmacy. There's others that would require essentially -- or that would involve lowering list prices going forward. I think it's really important, as you think about our business, 100% of our growth and the robust growth that we've seen, not only in this first quarter but also last year or before, is due to volume, not due to price. So, however, we move forward, with whatever type of rebate reform, we do believe it's going to be positive for patients, help patient out-of-pocket costs. And that, as J&J and based on our business model, we're going to be really well poised to succeed in that environment. So again, I mentioned earlier, we're working through a number of different scenarios, and we'll have to see what ultimately comes forward. But we believe that we're really well positioned to be able to continue to succeed in that environment. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Vamil, just to put a number or 2 around that. So last year, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business had $21 billion in discounts. We experienced net price decrease of 6.8%, yet we still had 8% growth. Unfortunately, those increased discounts aren't getting to the patients who go to the pharmacy on a monthly basis. They're experiencing elevated co-pays from what they had at least 3 or 5 years ago and even more recently. So that's where the system really needs to be fixed. But that should not have an impact on really how we drive our growth, and that's through innovation of unmet medical needs. Operator : Next question will be coming from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just a couple. On med devices, in response to an earlier question, Joe, you mentioned that you're looking for better performance going forward. Just for context, is the baseline now the 1Q growth of 4.3%? Or is your comment related to the 3.2% growth in '18? Joseph Wolk : So yes, I guess I think is a quick answer to that one, Jayson. Ashley is smiling at me. We want to see better performance. It's really benchmarked or anchored in our statement last year on our Medical Device in Analyst day, where we want to be at or above market by 2020. You've seen a consistent trajectory each and every quarter. So whether we're going to say 4.3% is now the new bar, we'll have to see how the quarters play out. But we're really looking at that 2020 horizon to make sure that we're at market performance or better. Ashley McEvoy : Yes, and I would just add, Jayson, to the question. Just to say, listen, the quarters aren't necessarily always linear. But consistent with what we did in '18 of improving year-over-year growth acceleration, that's absolutely what we plan to achieve in 2019. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's helpful. Just on Consumer, obviously a bit more of a challenging quarter. Looks like your expectation for market growth is down about 100 basis points. I appreciate the seasonal dynamics, but what do you think is the source of the softness? Is it geographic in nature? Is there price dynamic? Just a little more color there. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Thank you for the question. We see a deceleration in the first quarter. As I said, some of that is related to the seasonality and the structure of our portfolio. If you look at our OTC business, while we are very pleased with our performance overall for the quarter, we saw some softness due to the cold and flu season in Russia and Western Europe. If you look at Beauty, we see some deceleration in the market, but we continue to outperform the market in important geographies for us, like the United States. Baby is another category where we saw some deceleration in this winter, which affects our winter-related products. So it's really seasonality. We also see some impact of destocking in some retailers and some geographies. So I would say it's broadly based across geographies. Having said that, we expect the softness expected in Q1 to rebound in the balance of the year to hit our projected growth for the markets where we compete, of 2% for the year. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Jayson. Appreciate the question. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I do want to remind you that our Pharmaceutical business review in New Brunswick is on May 15, and we look forward to seeing all of you there. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you who participated in or listened to today's webcast. We hope you enjoyed the expanded management Q&A panel and that you sensed the confidence we have in our 2019 outlook which should set us up well for even better performance in 2020 and beyond. As Chris referenced, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Pharmaceutical business review day. Have a great day.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the second quarter of 2019. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  Additionally, during our Q&A session, Joe and I will be joined by Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee; and Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer. This is a great opportunity for you to engage with our Vice Chairman and not only obtain insights into the drivers of our current performance related to their areas of expertise but also hear their perspective on our approach to innovation and building differentiated capabilities that we expect to enable continued strong performance over time. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Our SEC filings, including our 2018 Form 10-K and our most recent 10-Q along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures, are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Regarding today's agenda, Joe will first provide some perspective on our overall results for the second quarter. I will then review the sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights on our cash position, capital allocation deployment and our updated guidance for 2019, along with some considerations for the balance of the year. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe Wolk : Great, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. I'm pleased to discuss with you our solid results for the second quarter, and how our performance during the first half of 2019 positions us well for the rest of the year and beyond. During the quarter, we continued to deliver growth across the three segments of our broad-based business, while also optimizing our portfolio and making progress against long-term strategies.  Revenue and earnings per share were in line with our expectations. As expected, we did experience sales deceleration from the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of generic and biosimilar competition in our Pharmaceutical business. Income in the first half of 2019 provides us the opportunity to continue investing to fortify, accelerate and potentially add to our pipelines across all three segments. We are committed to driving solid financial and operational performance for our shareholders, while also delivering on our responsibilities to patients, employees and communities as outlined in Our Credo. Chris will provide additional franchise and product detail, but let me provide some high level framing.  Our Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong growth across our oncology, pulmonary hypertension and immunology portfolios. We are particularly pleased with the success of DARZALEX, STELARA, IMBRUVICA and the INVEGA portfolio. As highlighted during our May pharmaceutical business review, our performance demonstrates our ability to consistently obtain approval from new products and line extensions. Once again, our performance was driven by volume of transformational medicines that address high unmet medical need rather than price.  In our Consumer segment, we accelerated growth in the second quarter in our stronghold beauty lines of NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. We are also pleased with the contributions from newly acquired businesses DR. CI:LABO and ZARBEE's. This growth more than offset the one-time impacts related to seasonality and inventory levels we mentioned during our first quarter call. We expect to deliver competitive growth relative to the market for the year.  In our Medical Devices segment, we did incur some isolated supply disruptions in the quarter, which Chris will outline and the impact limited growth by 1 point. Accounting for that, we grew about 4% in line with last quarter, and we are on track towards our goal of exceeding last year's performance. We continue to enhance our leadership positions in platforms such as electrophysiology, energy and endocutters. Orthopedics grew modestly during the quarter in line with Q1 led by hips and trauma. That being said, we remain intent on improving our performance in orthopedics and the segment at large.  Turning to earnings, earnings per share was favorably impacted by a significant gain recorded in other income. Specifically, the approximately $2 billion pretax gain related to the sale of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. We closed this transaction in early April. And as mentioned during the first quarter call, this gain comprises a large majority of our other income guidance for the full year 2019.  Other income for 2019 is on par with levels experienced in 2015. And consistent with past practice, we intend to utilize these gains to invest in opportunities that increase shareholder value and better position the business for long-term success.  I will now turn the call back to Chris to discuss second quarter sales drivers as well as highlight notable line items in our P&L before I return with some comments regarding our cash position, capital allocation priorities and guidance. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20.6 billion for the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 1.3% versus the second quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 1.6% as currency had a negative impact of 2.9 points. In the U.S. sales decreased 2.2%. In regions outside the U.S. our reported growth declined by 0.3%.  Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 5.5% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.7% worldwide, flat in the U.S. and 7.6% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.08 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.45 a year ago. Excluding the after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.58, representing increases of 21.5% and 22.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 25.2%.  Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the second quarter highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2018, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion growing at 4.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.3%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 4.4% due primarily to strong performance in our beauty franchise. Growth outside the U.S. was 0.7%. Consumer continues to grow its share in the e-commerce channel. Outpacing category growth rates in that channel with strong double-digit growth across all regions. The beauty franchise grew 10.7% or about 5% adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR. CI:LABO and the NIZORAL and ROC divestitures. Our priority brands NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance results due to share growth combined with strong sales in our club and e-commerce channels in the U.S. Share growth in NEUTROGENA was realized in the facial moisturizing treatment and sun protection categories.  AVEENO was further aided by retail stocking for the hair products launch, OGX and MAUI MOISTURE brands continued to experience solid growth, really resulting from new market expansions.  Over-the-counter medicines grew 2.8% globally, or 1% when adjusted to exclude the impact of ZARBEE's acquisition, which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC adjusted operational sales growth was just over 2% and is growing share. However, the U.S. was negatively impacted by retail inventory factors. ZYRTEC was a core contributor of sales growth and grew market share. Additionally, children's MOTRIN and TYLENOL in pediatric analgesics delivered strong sales and share growth. Adult TYLENOL also continues to drive significant share growth with consumption well outpacing the category, realizing double-digit consumption growth driven by rapid release gel, and TYLENOL arthritis products. However, TYLENOL sales declined slightly this quarter, as its consumption was more than offset by the lapping of the supply disruption associated with Hurricane Maria and the sell-through of 2018 elevated retail inventory levels that occurred in response to seasonal and other retailer stocking dynamics. Concluding on Consumer segment, Baby Care grew 2.2% globally. Growth was primarily due to lapping retail destocking and other events associated with the Johnson's Baby relaunch in the U.S. The Johnson's relaunch is stabilizing performance in all markets where it has been relaunched.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.5 billion grew 4.4% enabled by double-digit growth in nine key products. Sales were aided by one-time favorable pricing adjustments outside the U.S. worth almost 100 basis points worldwide, primarily driven by DARZALEX. Sales declined in the U.S. by 2% and increased outside the U.S. by 12.9%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 300 basis points and 500 basis points respectively. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at competitive levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds.  Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.1%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about 57% globally, or about 41% when removing the impact of a favorable one-time adjustment related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries. The U.S. grew 24% and continues to benefit from strong market growth, and about a 3 point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. The continued strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains across the 40 EMEA countries where it is commercially available, as well as Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Of note, just last week, we filed a regulatory submission for the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX for multiple myeloma in the U.S.  IMBRUVICA grew over 39% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. along with strong uptake outside of the U.S. and the European and Asia Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on first quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 3 points of market share, and continues to be the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which gained almost 8 points of market share in line one therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 20% with declines of 59% in the U.S. driven by generic competition, which was partially offset by growth of about 25% outside the U.S.  Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which gained 4 points of market share in U.S., with the penetration of prescribers split almost evenly among urology and oncology practices. We are also pleased with the early launch progress in EMEA, where ERLEADA is now available in five countries. During the quarter we filed regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Further, we are pleased with the early launch progress of BALVERSA for the treatment of adults with locally or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer.  Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just under 6% driven by continued strong performance in STELARA with growth of 18%, primarily from the Crohn's disease indication. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease where market share has increased by over 6 points in the U.S. compared to the second quarter of 2018.  Sales growth is partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to increased discounts, and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars.  Lastly, TREMFYA totaled $235 million globally, and is experiencing strong demand with over 35,000 patients on therapy. TREMFYA achieved a 7.6% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up 3 points from the second quarter 2018.  In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 5.4% led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV partially offset by cannibalization and increased market competition in other products.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing about 16% with higher market share, driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we are pleased with the launch performances SPRAVATO for treatment resistant depression. There are more than 1,600 sites certified with the REMS program and new treatment centers are being added daily. In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 14.7% primarily driven by declines in XARELTO, INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share. However, the share uptake was offset by the increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization resulting in an overall decline in XARELTO of 19% this quarter.  We've seen a positive response to XARELTO's new 2.5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. And while we expect the penetration of this expanded patient population to recur over time, we are confident in the value this indication provides to patients. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by 6% with strong performance in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 15% and 19% respectively on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. This growth was partially offset by TRACLEER which is negatively impacted by the recent generic entry in the U.S. as well as continued generic competition outside of the U.S.  I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.5 billion, declining 4.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan and ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.2% worldwide.  As Joe mentioned, we did have some isolated supply challenges in the quarter that negatively impacted growth by about 100 basis points worldwide. Adjusting for this, Medical Devices would have delivered growth of just over 4% consistent with the first quarter and a representative of the continued progress being made to improve performance in this segment.  Interventional Solutions grew about 16% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving more than 16% growth worldwide continuing its trend of double-digit growth. Growth was strong in all regions, driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth.  Additionally, we delivered a fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth in the CERENOVUS business driven by new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth.  Vision growth of 1.5% was driven by contact lenses which grew almost 3% globally led by daily disposables and astigmatism lenses in the OASYS family. Our contact lenses business remained strong with year-to-date growth of just under 5% in both the U.S. and OUS. Orthopedics growth remained consistent versus Q1 of 2019 with growth of 0.6% or 0.9% when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days. We continue to make progress to improve growth in this franchise and we remain committed to executing our innovation and commercial plans that aim to improve performance.  Hips grew 3.3%, which we expect to represent above market performance globally, driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS, which is now our number selling stem in the U.S.  Additionally, our KINCISE Surgical Impactor designed to replace the handheld mallet is enabling hip procedures in the U.S.  Trauma growth of 1.7% globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our Femoral Recon Nails. The U.S. growth rate of 3.3% is expected to be in line with the market and accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. Growth outside the U.S. was flat when adjusting for selling days and was also impacted by over 1 point due to timing of a tender shifting to the second half.  Spine declined over 2% with the U.S. being the primary driver of the decline. Our U.S. growth was flat when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days while we continue to see some stabilization of performance driven by new products such as a VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery and EXPEDIUM VERSE our all-in-one pedicle screw system for deformity. We continue to pursue opportunities to further improve growth including new innovations such as the Symfony system we plan to launch in the second half in complex cervical. Knees declined by less than 1% in the quarter with the U.S. being the driver of the decline. Offsetting strong growth of over 5% outside the U.S., it is expected to represent above market performance led by new innovation, including ATTUNE Revision and S+. The U.S. market is realizing positive uptake from the ATTUNE Revision System but we continue to have portfolio gaps which we are addressing to enhance performance, including the expected full commercial launch of our Cementless offering later this year.  Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics but was relatively stable overall compared to Q1. For the quarter U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms. Spine price pure price declined approximately 4% with hips, trauma and knees all down about 2%.  Turning to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery delivered global growth of just over 6% led by strong performance in both energy and endocutters primarily driven by share gains and new products in the Asia-Pacific region. Biosurgery declined by over 2% due to a stopped shipment of SURGIFLO in the U.S. which impacted global biosurgery growth by 11 points. We will continue to work with the FDA to ensure this important technology for patients is available again in the U.S. market as soon as possible.  Wound closure will grew approximately 3% as conventional and barbed sutures gained share. Across total general surgery worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 250 basis points due to a field action on our Intraluminal Staplers. Corrective actions were taken in the quarter and we began distributing to customers in June.  Selling days had a minor negative impact on our global growth rates in the second quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact in any subsequent quarter in 2019.  There\u2019s a final comment on Medical Devices based on feedback we received from the analyst community. We will no longer be providing utilization trends during this call. These estimates were based on limited external data and provide a low correlation to our actual market performance in the segments we compete. For the final update on utilization, we did want to provide you the latest figures for Q1 since we shared estimates last quarter. Hospital admissions, surgical procedures and lab procedures all increased by approximately 1.5%, 1% and 1.5%, respectively.  I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 second quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.3 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.58, an increase of 22.9% versus the second quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.63, up 25.2% versus second quarter 2018.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings, compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by product mix, which was offset by improvement in selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter as a result of leverage in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer business. We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 13%, which is higher than the second quarter 2018 by 30 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment in our Medical Devices business to support the development of our digital surgery platforms, including robotics. The increased levels of income recorded in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by the gain on the ASP divestiture.  Net interest expense was lower by $132 million, primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate of 20.4% was in line with the second quarter 2018 of 20.5%. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3%, compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. The second quarter of 2019 includes the tax impact on the gain of the ASP divestiture.  Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise increased from 33.7% to 41.9% in 2019, primarily driven by the gain on the divestiture of ASP. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment :  The decrease in Pharmaceutical margins by 160 basis points was primarily driven by product mix and lower other income. Consumer margins also decreased by 480 basis points, because of lower divestiture gains that were partially offset by leveraging in selling and marketing expenses. Medical Devices increased from 27.8% to 57.5% in 2019, due to the gain on the ASP divestiture partially offset by investments in digital surgery.  That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s second quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. Some of which were mentioned in my comments.  I will turn the call back to Joe. Joe Wolk : Thanks, Chris. With respect to cash, at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $29 billion of debt. These levels are similar to the first quarter. We\u2019ve simultaneously executed across all four tenants of our capital allocation strategy, which are designed and have proven historically to drive shareholder value.  Reinvestment in our business remains a top priority at Johnson & Johnson. We invested $2.7 billion in research and development in the quarter, which as Chris mentioned, represents a 30 basis point increase relative to net trade sales from the second quarter of 2018.  Regarding investment in inorganic opportunities, we closed the acquisition of Auris health, and we continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further enhance our portfolio. We also used cash in the quarter to continue returning value to shareholders. As announced in April, we increased our dividend for the 57th consecutive year to $0.95 per share, distributing $2.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter.  We also acted on our authorized $5 billion share repurchase program in the quarter deploying $2 billion for that purpose. We are now slightly above 75% complete with the authorized program.  I will now provide a few comments on the updates to our guidance for 2019. Our results for the first half of the year have given us additional confidence in our sales performance for the full year. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for operational sales growth by 50 basis points to a range of 1.0% to 2.0%. We are also increasing and tightening our operational sales growth adjusted for acquisitions and divestiture guidance to a range of 3.2% to 3.7%. The estimated impact of translational currency of 200 basis points has remained the same as our last update, although we are not predicting the impact of future currency movements.  Regarding adjusted pre-tax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pre-tax operating margin for the year to slightly decline, as we are planning for investment in innovation that adds to, solidifies and accelerates our pipelines. One really good example of this is our recent acquisition of Auris Health, which I just mentioned. Our opportunities to invest in digital surgery capabilities, coupled with other strategic investments in support of acquisitions, such as DR. CI:LABO are estimated to equate to about $0.10 of dilution. However, we have absorbed impacts like this in our current guidance.  For net interest expense, we are lowering the range to between zero and $100 million due to the favorability that Chris described in his earlier remarks. We are increasing our expectations for other income, the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from items such as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs .We have more certainty given that we are halfway through the year and having closed the Advanced Sterilization Products transaction, we are comfortable increasing and tightening the range to approximately $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, increasing the midpoint by $200 million compared to our prior guidance. Regarding our effective tax rate. We are increasing our effective tax rate guidance to a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, which includes the updated impact to tax associated with the Advanced Sterilization Products divestiture gain. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance for 2019. The operational EPS guidance represents strong growth of over 7% at the midpoint, which is approximately 2 times our adjusted operational sales growth, while simultaneously increasing investment levels to fortify our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business.  We do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling, I will provide a few qualitative factors to consider near-term. We expect the largest impacts from generics and biosimilars for the year in our pharmaceuticals business to occur in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by expected U.S. ZYTIGA accelerator erosion as well as the comparison to the highest growth quarter in 2018.  Also, U.S. TRACLEER and U.S. PROCRIT as well as VELCADE outside the U.S. expect accelerating erosion, driven largely by generic entries in new markets and additional competitors. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, we had the favorable impact of the U.S. baby pipeline replenishment due to the relaunch, which will not repeat. Lastly, as I mentioned, we are taking the opportunity to incrementally invest a higher level of divestiture gains. Most notably, we plan to increase investment in our pipelines, and therefore, we would expect our R&D spending to be higher in the second half of the year.  Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A, let me take a moment to thank Joaquin and Paul for being part of this call today, as well as our 135,000 global associates for their hard work and dedication. Without whom our continued success would not be possible.  Chris, let's begin the Q&A portion. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. As a reminder, I would encourage you to take advantage of Joaquin and Paul being on today's call by directing questions to them about their areas of expertise. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the questions. I guess my first question was just on the EPS guidance. You've steadily raised top-line growth this year. We haven't seen your earnings move that on much higher. I know you talked about some investments. But can you just elaborate a little bit more on this dynamic. So specifically, is this mostly kind of R&D going into the device business or is it across your franchises? And should we think about this as a sustained higher level of investment or more of a kind of a one-time step-up this year? My second question is -- quickly was on XARELTO. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics that are resulting in this kind of sharp decline we saw in the quarter? I guess the heart of this is, are we seeing Part D dynamics that are worse than you anticipated for that franchise? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Hey, Chris, this is Joe Wolk. Thanks for your question and good morning. With respect to EPS, I'll address that and then I'll turn it over to Joaquin to address the XARELTO question. With EPS, we are looking at the back half as investing more heavily in R&D as we've consistently done for a number of years now. When we have the opportunity to divest a business where we recognize an appreciable gain, we always look to turn that back into the business whether it's for our current pipelines to fortify or solidify those, as well as to add on to our pipelines. The investment is spread I would say primarily across Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals at this point. That's the plan. If you think about what I said in some of my prepared remarks with Auris and the acquisition there, that was an additional investment that would have been dilutive of about $0.10. We've absorbed that. And so that's kind of some of the examples that I could give you. Earlier in the year, you may recall, we also did a deal with Argenx for CD70. We're going to look to continue to do things like that inorganically, as well as within our own pipeline to see what we can accelerate and bring to the market a little bit earlier for patients. Joaquin you would like to take the XARELTO question? Joaquin Duato : Thank you. Thank you for the question. First, this was a strong quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with operational growth of 4.4% on very robust volume growth of 7.8% and especially very robust and strong OUS growth with 12.9%. So very positive quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with nine products achieving double-digit growth. Specifically when you look at the underlying growth that is when you exclude U.S. ZYTIGA our growth was 7.6%. So, that is a good position for us moving into the rest of the year, and especially moving into 2020, when we anniversary the U.S. loss of exclusivity.  Moving to XARELTO. The first thing is that we continue to see XARELTO is a very important driver of growth for the Pharmaceutical Group. The decline that you see in the quarter, as was explained already, is related to higher cost for patient access due to channel mix changes particularly more sales in PHS, [BDD] [ph] and Part D and also higher statutory rebates in the donut hole. We expect that we will be able to come back to positive territory once we anniversary these factors. Where is the growth going to come from once we do that? It\u2019s going to come first through continued volume and share growth in VTE and in AFib. Second, we will continue to reach more patients through our CA/PAD indication, which is tracking aligned with our cardiovascular drugs, launches like ENTRESTO or BRILINTA.  And finally, we continue our indication expansion through new indications such as VTE prevention in medically ill patients that we filed in the fourth quarter of 2018. So, overall, we continue to see XARELTO as a growth driver for the Pharmaceutical Group. We expect to be in positive territory once we anniversary those factors. And we will leverage the fact that XARELTO has the most complete set of indications, the largest safety data generating clinical trials, particularly in higher risk patients. And the most real world living experience with more than 6 million patients treated in the U.S. Chris DelOrefice : Chris, thanks for the questions. I guess wanted to short build on Joe's commentary. Just as a reminder in Q1, we took our adjusted ops guidance up $0.05 that was offset by currency. And another acquisition investment I think is a good example is DR. CI:LABO as well, that we've covered the dilutive impact there.  Next question please. Operator : The next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Maybe Joe, just a quick financial one for you and then I'll focus on pharma. So just considering your commentary on spending, your other income very strong in first half of the year as expected. But as you look into 2020, that's obviously a headwind. In prior annual periods, you used SG&A as a factor to offset any other income headwind. So are you comfortable as you head into next year that is supply chain reduction, some of the easing of exclusivity issues still creates an opportunity for levered earnings in 2020? Joe Wolk : Yes. So, David, thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that's a great question, when we get off and with respect to the level of other income that we've had. You'll notice that today's guidance reflects pretty similar to what we experienced in 2015. And when we went into 2016, we didn't skip a beat in terms of improving our operating margins. We were able to leverage SG&A as well as to have a healthier top-line. That is the outlook. We're not providing guidance, obviously for 2020 on today's call, but that is certainly the outlook and the expectation for our business moving into next year.  So, maybe to parlay some of the answer for Chris' question, is this a new level or not? We've challenged the teams to look for value creating opportunities, and we're planning for higher levels of investment. Should those not materialize, obviously, we would come back and revise guidance accordingly. But right now, we think we serve patients as well as shareholders best by looking for those opportunities. When we don't have those divestitures gains, there may be a need to scale back. We also appreciate our commitment with respect to earnings expectations as well. But we will manage for the long-term. David Lewis : Right Joe, very helpful. Then maybe for Joaquin I had a quick question on pharma, maybe a two part question. But many of the balance for J&J has been headwinds versus some of the pipeline tailwinds. In the next quarter or so, really going to see the full effect of ZYTIGA. We've already seen effect of REMICADE. So it does feel like in the next quarter or so Joaquin, the Pharmaceutical business does -- should begin to accelerate and that acceleration should be sustained into 2020. One, is that how you see the business here in the next quarter or so? And then secondarily, can you just give us an update on where we sit with the esketamine launch in terms of [center ads] [ph] and how that launches tracking relative to the expectations? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question, Dave. As I said before we see a strong underlying growth in the Pharmaceutical Group of 7.6% in the second quarter as we saw also strong underlying growth in the first quarter. So as we anniversary, in particular U.S. ZYTIGA LOE, you're going to see the underlying growth coming to the forefront and that predicts for a positive 2020. The drivers of this growth are on one hand a slower ZYTIGA erosion that we had anticipated, but most importantly, what you are seeing is a nice strong performance of our core brands. As I said before, we had nine brands growing double-digit in the second quarter. So that is how we see it similar to you see it too.  When it goes to SPRAVATO, we are working to be sure that we make it available for centers, physicians or patients as SPRAVATO was approved earlier in March. And we are excited about the therapeutic gap that is going to fill in treatment-resistant depression. We've created a model that is addressing all the areas to ensure appropriate use and distribution. We have a controlled distribution model. We have a REMS certification program and also it\u2019s a medicine that is self-administered but under physician administration with an observation period. So far, we have already 1,600 centers that have been certified and we continue to have great interest from the psychiatry community and the patient community in this treatment alternative. So we remain very positive of all the opportunities for SPRAVATO. Overall we're very positive about the opportunities that our pipeline have and the opportunities that we will be afforded in the coming years for continuing to be reaching more patients and perhaps this maybe a real opportunity for Paul to discuss what are the opportunities that we have in the pipeline in the short run. Paul Stoffels : I can add something there Joaquin. We expect at the moment a pipeline of 14 medicines which can exceed to $1 billion by 2023 and reaching millions of patients. And there is a significant opportunity there to increase -- grow to new indications, increase penetration and share but also of new formulations that we have seen with DARZALEX subcu. In addition we expect 40 line extensions with more than 10 having a potential to exceed $500 million. And at the same time going forward to your integrated, we're integrating disease areas and pathways and leveraging new technologies, cell therapy, gene therapy, data science and you will also see the first vaccines and with that continue to seek also the best signs in term of external. Our R&D portfolio is not one which comes together by chance, it's very well designed the way we do as we focus on differentiated medicines and vaccines, year of life, quality of life is the first metric before the business comes, sourcing selective and agnostic early mid and late stage and then we apply excellent in-development with time, quality and differentiation as the main drivers. And with that we have been able in the collaborative space to become a partner of choice. We have the pharma R&D review you can go back to the website and have review there, the material is all still on there for all the details but let me highlight a few of the very transformational products we have in the pipeline. We have the CAR-T which we licensed from Legend in 2017 now advancing fast. We took it over start of the Phase 1 last year and now we're entering into Phase 2b and with the data generated we expect to file in the range of 2021 and the ongoing study in China continue to perform very well and that gives us lot of confidence where at the movement three years in 88% of patients achieved an overall response rate and 74% achieved a complete response. So more data will be presented by the end of the year.  The new -- also new in our pipeline is cusatuzumab the anti-CD70 which will start earlier which we acquired from Argenx, again an investigational product for AML and that is a CD70 antibody and there we anticipate starting a Phase 2 later in the year. We also acquired three very interesting gene therapy products which represents a new platform for us in retinal disease and there the first for us is a first entry into gene therapy and positioned to be first in markets with best-in-class assets. And last but not least that we\u2019ve introduced -- also a new space for us with the vaccine portfolio where we are entering with an RSV vaccine now in late stage development in older adults. But also as we announced this week, we're going to progress with an HIV vaccine which is already ongoing in Africa since two years, where we did a Phase 2b and now we start with the study in the U.S., Latin America and the Europe where we will test the HIV vaccine in high risk and MSM and transgenders. And hopefully with that, getting just a few highlights to you on the pipeline.  We continue to build on our current pipeline with significant line extensions for expansion as well as I just was telling building on the new pipeline going for the future. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, David, appreciate the questions. Operator, next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So apologies to Paul and Joaquin, I\u2019ve got two for Joe. So Joe, first the fundamentals of J&J have been good. But the talc and opioid litigation have been overhangs for the stock. How do you move past those two issues? What are the milestones we should be looking for? And what are your messages to investors? And I have one follow-up. Joe Wolk : Sure. So thanks for the question, Larry, good to speak with you. So let me take those separately. With respect to talc, as you know, and as we've said many times on this call and many other forums that we've known for decades, and it's been validated by many other agencies that are highly respected that the product is safe, we also know that the company act to responsibly, so we'll continue to pursue defense of the company's actions as well as the product going forward.  The next major event I'd say starts in a few weeks here July 22nd to be specific, related to multi-district litigation, known as Daubert hearings, here in the State of New Jersey. That is not a ruling per se. It's a determination of evidentiary standards. So what evidence the point is, need to present what would be acceptable, and it covers about 85% of the outstanding cases. So we're obviously preparing very thoroughly for that. Again, when folks have a chance to really look at the facts in these cases, they see that the product is safe at the company act to responsibly.  As you know, and as we've also said many times, that even when a verdict goes against us originally, we often prevail on appeal. So we'll continue to fight that one. With respect to the Oklahoma and the opioids litigation, a similar dynamic in that the facts simply just don't align to what the state is claiming. And so what do I mean by that? The facts specifically are is that based on Oklahoma's own Medicaid reimbursement records, not just for a period of time, but for the last 20 years, less than 1% of the reimbursement occurred for Johnson & Johnson products.  Johnson & Johnson's products were designed to prevent abuse. Even the state's attorneys in this case, have said multiple times as I understand it throughout the proceedings, that this is not about Johnson & Johnson's products, it's about the opioid epidemic. We agree this is an epidemic with opioid addiction. However, it's going to be multiple factorial in terms of the solution set and it's going to require many sophisticated parties to make sure that we've got the right remedies in place for people who suffer from that. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Joe. And just to more quickly follow-up, just vision is being a bright spot for devices with both contact lenses and surgical growing above average, but this quarter was soft in both areas. Why was that and what turns those around? Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Wolk : Great. Good observation, Larry. So I would say vision has been very strong for us. We have had for a number of years now great cadence of innovation. I think it's really turned around that business from where it was earlier this decade, our latest innovations around transition lenses, which is being very well received in the marketplace. The contact lens performance and the underlying demand continues to be strong. I would say there were some inventory adjustments that were required, we thought it was going to be more of a hard Brexit which impacted some of the first quarter levels of inventory. So we're comfortable on the contact lens side.  On the surgical side, we're seeing a little bit softness specifically in the U.S., outside the U.S. it\u2019s still fairly strong with some of the IOL lenses and the innovation that we introduced here about a year, year and a half ago. In the U.S., cataract and refractory are both a little bit softer from a market perspective. And we have to improve the innovation cadence there as we move into 2020. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Larry. Operator, next question? Operator : Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Just one for me, just on the area of digital surgery and robotics. I was wondering, if you could just provide us with an update on where you stand across the various business units in those efforts, specifically with the Verb products, what your kind of current thinking is around the opportunities with Auris and then also Orthotaxy? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Great, thanks for the question, Kristen, nice to speak with you. So I'll start, but I'll probably turn it over to Paul as well to talk about each of the specific platforms. But maybe it's appropriate at the outset just to take a step back to provide kind of an update to our overall digital surgery strategy inclusive of the robotic enabled surgery for and endoluminal orthopedics as well as general surgery.  So as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're very pleased with the Auris Health acquisitions, it\u2019s off to a great start. Not only did we get some great products there and some great technology. But we secured one of the pioneers with respect to robotic surgery and Dr. Fred Moll and his team. So they're currently looking at and assessing all of our platforms. We think it's prudent of us to utilize that expertise to look at not just what we're doing for the Monarch platform in lung cancer and bronchoscope but also to take a look at Orthotaxy and as well as our partnership with Verily to see how we can make sure that it's not a matter of coming to market fast, but coming to market fast. And so we want to make sure that we've got a differentiated product, one that competes with the current product offerings that are out in the marketplace for the next three, five, 10 years down the road. So that's how we're approaching it. Our timelines have not changed with Orthotaxy specifically, we're still progressing towards a 2020 media regulatory submission. We feel that that's very much on track. As you know, with the acquisition of Auris, we are on the market with their Monarch platform. And we continue to make great advancements with the Verily partnership. But, Paul maybe I can turn it over to you to talk about some of the finer points on what the technology can offer? Paul Stoffels : Thank you, Joe. Let me start with Auris, which as Joe said this is off to a great start with great acquisition. The Monarch platform is currently on the market for the diagnosis of lung cancer. And that is part of a broader lung cancer initiative in the company where we both look at early diagnosis as well as early intervention. And with an existing marketed platform that accelerates activity in that space very much.  But furthermore, the possibilities of the endo -- in endourology we\u2019re probably targeting a 90% stone free in a single treatment is within reach, as well as a very significant opportunity in GI endoscopy gives us a very strong start in the robotic space with the Monarch platform. The eye platform from Auris is a very, very attractive space which has more reach and more different positioning possible and all discovering all of the different interventions. So that's where we are aiming for finally.  If you look into Orthotaxy, we continued to receive great feedback about that platform, especially about its smaller footprint, the fact that it is an imageless system, and the surgeon\u2019s freedom to move within the cutting plain defined by the robot. So -- and that resulted in an overall ease to use, which is greatly appreciated by the surgeons. And finishing up with Verb, as you expressed the confidence in the platform and the value proposition, we recently successfully completed a series of end-to-end procedures, engaging a group of global KOLs across a subset of target specialties including general and with hernia, colorectal and bariatrics in urologic, in gynecologic and thoracic surgery and we continue to believe our system will address the current limitations of robotic surgeries such as access and reach, the footprint and cost and the workflow and advanced instrumentation to such a much better outcome. I was personally able to operate one of the instruments in the lab and it's really a very impressive new robotic surgical tool. And also overall, the surgeons, their feedback continues to be very positive on the product. So overall, a very good start. Hard work for us and lots of developments to be done but on a very good path. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Paul. Thanks Kristen for the questions. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : I was wondering, on the R&D spend, you mentioned on the pharma side, it sounds like that ramp is mainly external opportunities, but I was wondering if there is any internal programs that you're going to be ramping spend on, if you can be more specific there? And then on DARZALEX any insight you can provide on average treatment duration now and how you see this evolving over time and then any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about pricing the subcu formulation? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Let me start with DARZALEX. I'm telling you that we are very pleased with the progression of DARZALEX. We had a very strong growth in the quarter, with 57%, 41% when you neutralize for the one-time price effects. So we are pleased with the progression -- with the operation of DARZALEX and the strong growth that we are having across all lines of therapy. Particularly, recently we had two important events. One is the approval of the front line indication in eligible patients in the combination with REVLIMID, which was much anticipated and that will give us together with the filing of the also front line indication in transplant eligible will give us three indications in front line. So to your question on the duration, as we move into earlier lines, the duration of the treatment increases. When it comes to the subcu that we filed earlier this week, we think it is a very important opportunity for DARZALEX overall. Keep in mind that we're going to be able to reduce the infusion time from eight hours that we have today to five minutes. So that's going to give significant advantages in terms of adoption of DARZALEX, in particular it mainly aligns particularly when you think that 50% of the use of DARZALEX today in the US is in oncology clinics in outpatient patients. So we think that this combination is going to make DARZALEX easier to use for physicians, more convenient to patients. If you add to that the number of studies in which we are showing very strong results in front line will pertain for a very positive continue adoption of DARZALEX that we see one of the major drivers of the growth of the Pharmaceutical Group. Paul Stoffels : With regard to the spending internal or external, once we bring in an asset internally, we consider it all as internal spending. The external spending we do is on milestones and that has been an upfront and that has been a very effective way to create value for us. We do less acquisitions, but we invest a lot in external innovation in early stages through collaborations through our JLABS and also through our venture capital and through acquisitions. But once we acquire products, it becomes part of a portfolio and we continue to drive the success of that. We have a significant number of internal derived opportunities, let's say, at the moment in the range of 50-50, 60-40 of products coming from our own portfolio as products which we brought in and we invest also something like 50-50 in new products but also as Joaquin was saying, in line extensions. Line extensions are great opportunities to have de-risked products and get additional indications and additional access to patients which grow products faster. And that's why you see us doing on good assets very extensive developments very fast so that indication after indication we can bring to the market. That grows a product. Look at DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, now ERLEADA just to name a few. The next generation of TRINZA with a six month so we build on de-risked products also as well as on new platforms as I indicated earlier, with the gene therapy, cell therapy and the new assets which we brought in. Joaquin Duato : Another area, Terrence, where we are making significant investments is seen in data sciences. We are trying to embed data sciences in everything we do across R&D, to both accelerate discovery and early development and also to improve late development. For example, we are using data sciences to better understand disease expression and progression and also to be more effective at molecular invention. Now, we have models to accelerate molecular design of enemies for high priority targets across all our therapeutic areas. In late development, we are also using data sciences to do a step change in the efficiency in which run clinical trials and also to create synthetic control arms and better stratify patients. So we are embedding as I said, data sciences and making significant investments to be bilingual both in science and in data science. Terence Flynn : Great. Thank you, Paul and Joaquin. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks Terrence for your questions. Appreciate it. Operator, next question. Operator : Next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : I have a specific question and then a big picture one. Specifically, you talked about 100 basis points of supply issues in Medical Devices. I was curious if you could share which devices were impacted and if that's been fully resolved at this stage? Joe Wolk : Joanne, thanks for the question. So there were two that were mentioned. Obviously, our first priority is patient safety. One has been remediated and the product is actually back on the market and that's related to our circular staplers. So there was a manufacturing lot that we pulled off the market. Again, it's been remediated and everything is back in order. The second was, during a routine FDA inspection through a third party manufacturer, which is manufacturing SURGIFLO for us. They went through the regulatory filing, identified a change in the manufacturing process. So they were just seeking more information. We're working fully with the FDA and expect that to be resolved shortly. Joanne Wuensch : Then my big picture question has to do with the lay of the land in healthcare and how you're looking at patient volumes and pricing and then quoting with that, how are tariffs impacting the business? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Okay. I'll start maybe, and maybe I'll turn over to Joaquin and/or Paul to give you some further insights. But with respect to tariffs first, I would say that, we've had modest impact on our business, nothing that's noteworthy. If you look specifically where most of the rhetoric and dialogue has occurred, it's been around China. Our business in China across all three of our segments has been very strong, high-double digit growth, mid teens or higher across all three segments. So we really haven't seen that impact. With respect to pricing, the Pharmaceutical results, again, I think we would all agree, are very strong and that is in the face of net prices declining by 6%, similar to what we saw in 2018. So in the US strong growth. We've got generic and biosimilar erosion and we've got about 6% price headwind, yet the transformational portfolio continues to deliver for patients as well as for our business results. I don't know Joaquin if you want to add anything around the pricing dynamic. Joaquin Duato : Pricing, we see continued price erosion, which is a dynamic that we have seen in the US market for the last couple of years, which we, as we have commend earlier, more than offset with our volume growth. And overall, we don't see that trend changing. What we think is that in that context, we are positioned most favorably than the rest of the companies because of three reasons. One is the diversification of our portfolio. We had in 2018, 11 medicines of more than a $1 billion. So we are present across many therapeutic areas. Also, we have payer mix which is very similar to the overall market. We don't over index in any particular payer. The second thing is that, we have a very robust volume growth. And this volume growth, which is driven by the share that we are gaining and the penetrations through new indications, more than offsets that price adoption. And finally, we do have a strong presence OUS. 45% of our sales are OUS and in this quarter, for example, our sales OUS grew 12.9%. So, overall, we do believe that if we are able to continue to do what we do exceptionally well, which is bringing new breakthrough medicines to patients, we are very well positioned in this context of price erosion. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you. Thanks Joanne for your questions. Next question please. Operator : Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Just a high level question on devices. I mean based on our math on a comp adjusted basis, you saw another quarter of growth acceleration. I'm just wondering if you could comment on, are we past the trough now in devices and how much of the healthy growth this quarter came -- what was J&J specific versus perhaps a uplift in the various different market growth rates? Joe Wolk : Yes. So, great questions Danielle. Yes. We do think that the trough is behind us with respect to Medical Devices. Actually, Ashley McEvoy and her team are doing a great job in terms of ensuring that across all four platforms so, eye, health, cardiovascular, interventional and orthopedics, that we've got solid plans for execution and improved performance going forward, coupled with stronger innovation. So I would say, I don't have a full estimate as to what other competitors' challenges may have added to ours. We've got a ballpark estimate, but I would say, it was probably offset by the supply disruptions that we referenced earlier. So you get back to that normalized level of, let's call it, 3% to 4%. Danielle Antalffy : And then just a higher level comment on the other income upside that you're going to be reinvesting, to follow up on an earlier question. When you do need to scale back spend, given potentially lower other income as we look into 2020 and beyond, what are the levers that you can pull to do that and in which businesses is it easiest to sort of scale back without giving up anything on the top-line? Joe Wolk : So, we're currently looking to improve the operating margin profile within our Consumer unit. A great job by Thibaut Mongon, Joaquin in terms of really centering and focusing our investment, prioritizing that toward our stronghold of beauty, skin care, as well as over-the-counter medicines. And we are projected to have a strong improvement in that margin profile for this year and then, going forward. I would say the same with Medical Devices. Once you have an improving top line, that should help the rest of the P&L. And Ashley is going about her business that way and making the right structural changes. And then, lastly, in Pharmaceuticals, we're already at the top of the peer set with respect to operating margin performance, but as that top-line improves and we anniversary some of the challenges that I mentioned earlier, that should also bode well for some, I would say, incremental improvement. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks Danielle. Appreciate the questions. Next question please. Operator : Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Thanks for taking the questions. Just one follow up on pharma, and then, a bigger picture question on Medical Devices. So, you talked a little bit about the XARELTO launch for CAD and PAD maybe taking some time. If you could elaborate maybe on what some of the challenges there, or steps that have to take place to start gaining momentum on that front? And then, I just have one follow up. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question Matt. Certainly, the difference with the launches that we had in other indications like AFib and VTE is that the use of novel oral anticoagulants in CAD/PAD is novel. So we are establishing a new standard of care there. So far it was either aspirin the one medicine used. So, establishing a new standard of care takes longer than when you are comparing to an existing standard of care. So we think that the progression will continue to be like a chronic medication, steady but constantly growing. And as I said, we are exceeding the launch align metrics of BRILINTA and we are similar to ENTRESTO. At this point, just to give you an idea of the extension of the use of XARELTO in CAD/PAD, we have 8,500 prescribers already. So we see a steady climb and we are confident that it would become very important driver of growth for XARELTO. Matt Miksic : That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just on Medical Devices broadly, I think, one of the questions we get often is just the steps that J&J can take to turn the growth up in this division. Of course, you have bright spots like Biosense Webster and Cerenovus and others in the quarter, which you've talked about. But I wonder if I can ask just what -- robotic surgery is obviously an area where you've invested, continue to invest, but Joe maybe if you could sketch out the areas of Med Devices where you feel like there are disruptive opportunities or areas where J&J can enter, expand, invest and make an impact on this division? Joe Wolk : Sure, Matt. So, again, we are seeing improved growth rates from what we were experiencing 12 to 24 months ago. We're continuing on that right cadence I believe. If I look at opportunities as to where we're playing, you mentioned digital surgery, that will be a growth driver going forward. I think in our interventional space, specifically around our Cerenovus unit and stroke, it's a small unit that we don't report out on, but we grew about 25% in the quarter. We think that has tremendous opportunity. We do know that eye health and contact lenses specifically will be a growth driver for us based on the cadence of innovation we've got coming through there. And we'll have improved performance with orthopedics. We obviously had some challenges last year with respect to knee performance. As we launch with Orthotaxy at some point late next year or early in '21, as well as bring cementless options to the marketplace, I think we'll be in very good shape, where you'll see this unit performing at or above market. Matt Miksic : And any things on areas outside the Company that you think about in terms of investing, not just in your businesses but externally like Auris? Joe Wolk : Yes. We're always looking, Matt, across all three of our segments to fortify the portfolio that we have today. There's one or two areas that we're not currently in, but we're going to make sure that : one, we can create value and that asset is in our hands and that we're compensating shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. So we don't just simply look at the cost of capital. There would be some risk opportunity associated with that opportunity that we will make sure that we compensate for. So, I guess that's a long way of saying, we're going to make sure that we pay the right value. We're not in a position were we need to do something. We'll do something when it makes sense to do it from a strategic as well as a financial perspective. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks Matt. Appreciate the questions. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : I'll be quick. Just two and I'll mention them both upfront. First, on the Pharma side, at the beginning of the year, you guys gave guidance on the headwind from generics and biosimilars of roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion. Can you just give an update on where you stand with that number today? And then, secondly, just a quick clarification on the talc litigation. Are you guys reserving for that currently or no? Thank you. Joe Wolk : So, let me take the talk question quickly. So, we did incur a charge in our earnings for the quarter of $190 million. That is related to defense costs only. That does not contemplate settlement or any liability payments. So again, we think we are on very firm ground with respect to the facts, supporting our case and as I've mentioned on appeal, when we don't win in the original verdicts we prevail on appeal. So that's the only charge that you'll see in there for the quarter, Bob. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Bob. As I said before, our growth this year is mainly driven by the strength of our core franchises. We have nine medicines growing double digit. And we see all across our franchises very strong growth. We commented DARZALEX with 57%, but also IMBRUVICA 39%, STELARA 18%, TREMFYA doing very well. So overall very positive growth in our core franchises. At the same time, we have seen less genetic erosion than anticipated mainly due to two factors. One, it's related to lower generic erosion in ZYTIGA that we anticipated and we think that's going to increase as the year goes on, and also a delay in the introduction of TRACLEER genetic. So we see now our headwind from LOE perspective between $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joe Wolk : Thanks, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the call for your interest as well as your time. As you can see in today's results, not just for the quarter but for the first half, we are well set up for both near and long term success. We continue to manage our portfolio to benefit patients, healthcare systems and shareholders and we will continue to invest for impact. As we anniversary some of the LOE challenges in Pharmaceuticals and continue our upward momentum in our Consumer Health and Medical Device segments, we feel the business is poised for even greater success going forward. So, again, thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Christopher DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the second quarter of 2019. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, during our Q&A session, Joe and I are pleased to be joined by Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2018 Form 10-K and our most recent 10-Q along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures, are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, Joe will first provide some perspective on our overall results for the third quarter. I will then review the sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and our updated guidance for 2019, along with some considerations for the balance of this year and initial high level thoughts for next year. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joseph Wolk : Great, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. As you might suspect, we're very pleased to discuss our strong third quarter results. Our performance positions us well to exceed the 2019 outlook we provided at the start of the year, providing us with a solid foundation for the future. During the quarter, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while also making investments that advance our innovative pipeline across all three segments. We remain committed to advancing solutions that enhance the lives of patients, consumers, employees, and communities, while also delivering value to our shareholders. In a moment, Chris will provide details on our results, but before he does let me offer some general observations in context about the performance in the third quarter. While there are many headlines surrounding our company as well as the industry, we continue to deliver lifesaving and life enhancing products to patients and consumers, which translates into solid financial performance. We must recognize that businesses in the U.S. are working in a very litigious environment, but the fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business are strong. We remain confident in our ability to navigate challenges and deliver results focused on our mission as we have done for 133 years. For the quarter, our pharmaceutical business even in the face of significant generic and biosimilar competition once again delivered above-market performance across our broad base of therapeutic areas led by double-digit growth in 10 key products. We are particularly pleased by the progress in the quarter of regulatory approvals and submissions, notably the FDA's approval of ERLEADA for the treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer based on the TITAN data and the approval of STELARA in ulcerative colitis in the EU, additional indications for both of those products. In our Consumer Health business, third quarter performance reflects continued strength in areas we prioritized earlier this year, beauty and over-the-counter medicines. These businesses are fueled by new product innovations and recent acquisitions in large markets experiencing higher growth, which positions the consumer business to grow competitively [ph]with the market while also improving the profitability of this segment. Our Medical Device business continues to accelerate growth. We had some tailwinds that Chris will outline, but the adjusted operational sales growth was the best quarterly growth we posted since 2015. Interventional Solutions delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth, Surgery improved, and Orthopedics progress continues. We have successfully executed multiple launches in the quarter, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue the momentum. Let me turn the discussion back to Chris for details on the third quarter sales drivers and notable line items in our P&L. I will return prior to the Q&A to provide comments on our cash position and guidance. Christopher DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20.7 billion for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 3.2% as currency had a negative impact of 1.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 5.4% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.2% worldwide; 3.4% in the U.S.; and 7.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.44 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.12, representing increases of 1.5% and 3.4% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.9%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the third quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2018, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion growing a 3.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.3% with strong growth in the U.S. of 2.4% due primarily to strong performance in our beauty and OTC franchises. Growth outside of the U.S. was 0.6%. On a year-to-date basis, Consumer grew double digits across all regions in the e-commerce channel. The beauty franchise grew 8.1% or 2% adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR. CI:LABO and the ROC divestiture. Our priority brands, NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance results due to share growth combined with timing of promotions in our club channel in the U.S. Share growth in NEUTROGENA was realized in the facial moisturizing treatment, cleansing, and sun protection categories and AVEENO share gains were due to the hair product line relaunch. Over-the-counter medicines grew 6.5% globally or just over 5% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the ZARBEE\u2019s acquisition which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC adjusted operational sales growth was just over 5% and is growing share. Adult TYLENOL was the core contributor to sales growth and continues to drive significant share growth driven by rapid release gel and TYLENOL arthritis products. ZYRTEC continued to grow market share. However, sales declined due to lapping 2018 retail stocking due to competitor supply disruption. Concluding the Consumer segment, baby care declined 9.8% globally or negative 8% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. This decline was primarily due to lapping retail stocking associated with the Johnson's baby relaunch most notably in the U.S. Excluding the relaunch comparisons, U.S. baby was flat.  Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $10.9 billion grew 6.4% enabled by double-digit growth in 10 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 4% and increased outside the U.S. by 10%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 350 and 560 basis points respectively. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above-market levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just over 10% driven by strong double-digit performance in STELARA, TREMFYA, in SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of Remicade of almost 17% due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. STELARA growth of almost 31% was primarily from the Crohn's disease indication where market share has increased by over six points in the U.S. compared to the third quarter of 2018. TREMFYA grew over 70% and achieved an 8.1% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2.5 points from the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, we filed an application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of TREMFYA for treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of almost 9%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about 57% globally or about 42% when adjusting for the impact of a favorable comparison to the prior year one-time reimbursement adjustment outside the U.S. The US grew just over 26% and continues to benefit from strong market growth and about 3.5 point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains across the 41 EMEA countries where it is commercially available as well as Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Of note, we received regulatory approval for DARZALEX combination regimen for newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma in the U.S. IMBRUVICA grew 33.5% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth primarily in the CLL indication in the U.S. along with strong uptake outside the U.S. in the European, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America markets. In the U.S. based on second quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy IMBRUVICA gained approximately 2.5 points of market share and continues to be the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia which gained above 8.5 points of market share in line 1 therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 21% with declines of almost 56% in the U.S. due to generic competition which was partially offset by continued strong growth of about 21% outside the U.S. In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA which gained almost 3 points of market share in the U.S. As Joe highlighted, during the quarter we received approval in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are also pleased with the launch progress in EMEA where ERLEADA is now available in 8 countries. In Neuroscience our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well growing 15% with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO. Patient demand is strong and the unmet need remains very high. To date over 2000 sites have been certified in the REMS program to become a SPRAVATO treatment center and more than 500 of these are actively treating patients with treatment resistant depression. We are encouraged by the continued progression of treatment centers being certified and treating patients. During the quarter we filed an sNDA in the U.S. for a second indication for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder who have active suicidal ideation with intent. In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 3.6% led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 4.8% primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO was flat with volume increases offset by rebates primarily due to increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50% to 70% along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization. And just yesterday we were pleased to announce the U.S. approval of an additional indication for XARELTO for the treatment of VTE in the medically ill population. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by 0.5% with strong performance in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 13% and 24% respectively on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. This growth was offset by TRACLEER, which was negatively impacted by the recent generic entry in the U.S. as well as continued generic competition outside of the U.S. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.4 billion declining 2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestitures of LifeScan and ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.3% worldwide. Growth in the quarter was aided by one-time items contributing about 80 basis points to growth, largely related to forward buying ahead of the consumption tax change in Japan, primarily impacting vision business. We expect the majority of this to sell-through in Q4 with the remainder occurring Q1 2020. Interventional Solutions grew over 14% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business, achieving about 15% growth worldwide, continuing its trend of double-digit growth. Growth was strong in all regions driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. During the quarter we were pleased to share the results of the atrial fibrillation progression trial known as ATTEST, which showed that patients treated with catheter ablation were almost 10 times less likely to develop persistent atrial fibrillation than patients on standard antiarrhythmic drugs at three years after study initiation. Additionally, our CERENOVUS business delivered a fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth driven by new product innovation including EMBOTRAP for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth. Vision growth of 6.1% was driven by contact lenses which grew 7.6% globally led by daily disposables in the OASYS family. As I mentioned earlier, total vision sales were aided by a forward buy in Japan in advance of a consumption tax increase of approximately 300 basis points globally. In surgical vision we launched our TECNIS Synergy intraocular lens, a continuous range of vision intraocular lens. Orthopedics growth continues to improve with significant acceleration in the quarter delivering growth of 2.3%. It is the largest quarterly growth since 2016. This progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance. Hips grew 2.9% driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach, continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS and the KINCISE surgical automated system. Trauma growth of 4.7% globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our Femoral Neck System and Recon Nails. Sales growth was also aided by a one-time rebate reserve adjustment in the U.S. or almost 90 basis points globally. Adjusting for this item, as the market leader in trauma, we are driving growth and expect our performance to represent growth in line with the overall global market. Spine declined less than 3% with the U.S. being the primary driver of decline. While we continue to see stabilization of performance driven by new products such as the VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery and our newly launched CONDUIT Interbody Platform with EIT cellular titanium 3-D printer technology to treat degenerative spine disease, we lost share in the quarter. Knees growth was 2.3% in the quarter with declines in the U.S. offset by strong double-digit growth of 10.8% outside the U.S. OUS results are expected to represent above market performance led by new innovation including ATTUNE Revision and S+. The U.S. market continues to realize positive uptake from the ATTUNE Revision system and in this quarter we launched the ATTUNE Cementless Knee in the U.S. and other select markets around the world. Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics, but did show modest improvement compared to Q2. However, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms for the quarter. Spine, hips, and trauma, all declined approximately 2% with knees declining about 1%. Moving to the results for the Surgery business, advanced surgery delivered global growth of over 5% led by strong performance in energy of 8% primarily driven by share gains and new products in the Asia-Pacific region. Biosurgery grew approximately 5% with growth in all regions, particularly the Asia-Pacific region. We were pleased to have brought SURGIFLO back to the market in the U.S. at the end of July, with that one month of being off the market in the quarter, impacting global growth by about 100 basis points. Wound closure grew almost 5% driven by share gains in conventional and barbed sutures and continued strong market growth in China. Timing of purchases in the veterinary channel favorably impacted global growth by almost 100 basis points. Additionally, we launched the industry's first powered circular stapler for colorectal, gastric, and thoracic surgery, a key innovation for us in our general surgery franchise. As expected, selling days had a minor positive impact on our global growth rates in the third quarter and we do not expect a significant impact in Q4. I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 third quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $0.8 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.12, an increase of 3.4% versus the third quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.17, up 5.9% versus third quarter 2018. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceuticals business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of favorable segment mix, planned prioritization in the Consumer and Medical Devices businesses, as well as expense leveraging in the Pharmaceuticals business. We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 12.5% which is higher than the third quarter 2018 by 20 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment in our Medical Devices business related to robotics, digital programs and key growth platforms. The change recorded in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by contingent liability reversal in the third quarter of 2018. Net interest expense was lower by $109 million primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and lower interest expense due to a lower average debt balance. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018 tax rate of 11.1%. As a reminder, regarding the third quarter of 2018 the company recorded a favorable financial impact of approximately 9% related to U.S. tax reform. The current quarter includes an estimated tax benefit for the transition provisions of Swiss tax reform partially offset by an adjustment to existing tax reserve positions negatively impacting the effective tax rate. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the adjustment to tax reserve positions previously noted. Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the third quarter of 2019 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percent of sales increased from 33.3% to 34.3% in 2019 primarily driven by improvements in selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter as previously noted. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. The decrease in Pharmaceutical margins by 180 basis points was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in cost of goods sold. Consumer margins improved by 450 basis points primarily due to planned optimization of selling and marketing expenses. Medical Devices improved by 220 basis points due to investment optimization and selling, marketing and administrative expenses and other income items which were partially offset by R&D investment in robotics and digital surgery solutions. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2019. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the third quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. I will now turn the call back to Joe. Joseph Wolk : Thanks Chris. With respect to cash at the end of the third quarter we had approximately $11 billion of net debt consisting of approximately $18 billion of cash and marketable securities approximately $29 billion of debt. We estimate our year-to-date free cash flow to be approximately $14.5 billion. We acted upon all four tenets of our capital allocation strategy which are designed to and continue to drive shareholder value. Some of the highlights include investing $2.6 billion in research and development in the quarter, investing in our business delivered transformative healthcare solutions remains a top priority at Johnson & Johnson. As in previous years we expect to experience even higher levels of investment during the fourth quarter. Some tangible examples of where this investment will be directed, we will be progressing our future digital surgery offerings and R&D activity related to CAR T, cusatuzumab, DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation and line extensions within the immunology portfolio, such as STELARA in lupus. At the same time, we continue to evaluate strategic transactions that will further enhance our broad-based business and drive value creation, having invested nearly $6 billion this year. We also used cash in the quarter to complete the authorized $5 billion share repurchase program announced just last December deploying $1.2 billion in the third quarter. I will now provide updates to our guidance for 2019. We continue to see strong results across our enterprise. As such, we are increasing sales guidance and are now comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.0% for the year. This growth would result in sales for 2019 on a constant currency basis of approximately $83.7 billion to $84.2 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 4.5% and 5.0% for the year. Both metrics are up over 200 basis points at the respective midpoints from the original guidance we provided in January and over 100 basis points from the guidance we provided last July. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.10 the negative impact of foreign currency translation is slightly worse than our last guide by 20 basis points and is estimated to negatively impact reported sales by approximately 2.3 points. Under this scenario we expect to report sales growth in the range of 0.2% to 0.7% or approximately $81.8 billion to $82.3 billion. Moving to items impacting earnings, net interest expense is now expected to be net interest income of $50 to $100 million. For other income and expenses we are tightening the range to $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion. As a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2019 is now estimated to be approximately 18.0% to 18.5% reflecting the higher end and a tightening of the previous guidance range. Given those updates we are now comfortable with the adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $8.84 to $8.89 per share on a constant currency basis. This reflects operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.1% to 8.7% which is higher than our prior guidance and reflective of our solid performance this year. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of potential impact on EPS using recent exchange rates our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.22 per share versus prior guidance of negative $0.20. Accounting for that, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.62 to $8.67 per share reflecting growth of approximately 5.7% at the midpoint, which is also higher than our previous guidance. While we do not provide quarterly guidance and are not providing guidance for next year just yet, I will provide a few comments for you to consider looking ahead, both for the fourth quarter as well as for 2020 to better inform your modeling. One notable item for the fourth quarter of this year, you may recall that in the first quarter of 2018 we had an elevated level of adjusted other income of approximately $800 million, primarily due to the LifeScan divestiture. There is nothing similarly planned for the fourth quarter of this year. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, we are still in the process of finalizing our 2020 plans, but allow me to provide some context for line items where we have some preliminary insights. Qualitatively for sales, we expect our Pharmaceutical business to continue to deliver growth above market. Our Medical Device business is anticipated to continue sales momentum, and we remain focused on optimizing our consumer portfolio for competitive growth, while improving profitability. In terms of items on the P&L, again, robust plans are still being developed by our leaders, but we will continue to balance improved operating efficiency with investing for sustainable long-term success. For other income and expense at this early stage, we expect at this time to record approximately half the level of income, just provided in our current 2019 guidance range. We continue to prefer investment in R&D to progress our robust pipeline of assets. This includes continued investment in our digital surgery portfolio, which was bolstered by the acquisition of Auris that we completed in the second quarter of 2019. For the effective tax rate, based on current legislation, we anticipate the range being relatively similar to the 2019 full year tax guidance I provided earlier, 18.0% to 18.5%. And while we don't forecast currency fluctuations based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to continue to be a headwind, although less than this year's impact. That concludes our financial summary. I am pleased to be joined on today's call by Ashley, Thibaut and Jennifer to help me address your questions. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I would like to thank our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their continued hard work and dedication. We celebrated the 75th anniversary of our initial public offering at the New York Stock Exchange in September, a significant milestone made possible by their tremendous efforts and those who preceded them. I will now turn the call back over to Chris to begin the Q&A portion. Christopher DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. As a reminder, I would encourage you to take advantage of Ashley, Thibaut, and Jennifer being on today's call, by directing questions to them about their areas of expertise. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning and thanks for the questions. Maybe just Joe, one for you and then one for Ashley. Joe, this is a greater level of financial disclosure we typically get heading into 2020, so thank you in advance. We are just doing some quick math here, it does sound like you're basically suggesting for 2020 outlook, but you are not providing official guidance. Top line should accelerate into next year, and you're pretty comfortable with that kind of relative type of leverage J&J has done historically, which is sort of a earnings growth rate kind of in the 1.5 ratio at earnings relative to sales, is that a decent way of thinking about 2020? Joseph Wolk : Yes, so David, thanks for the comments. Certainly, glad that you find some of the outlook commentary helpful to you. I do want to emphasize though what I said in the prepared remarks in that it's -- our teams are still working through their plans for 2020. We want to see the momentum that we've seen through this year carry on through. With respect to top line, I would say, if you recall back in January, we were a little bit more conservative with this year's outlook given some of the ability to hold on to brands that were facing exclusivity risk, ZYTIGA, PROCRIT, TRACLEER. We performed a little bit better. So, we do expect to be above market, but just not as pronounced as we would have thought in the beginning of this year for 2020, but we're feeling very good about the momentum. With respect to the income ratio to sales growth ratio, I'd say that's a little bit early to comment on. I would expect to see some moderating more back towards -- around sales growth. This year if you look at it, let's just take adjusted -- to adjust it, so accounting for divestitures and acquisitions impact, it's a 1.8 ratio, that's a little bit higher than we typically run at, and then obviously we're going to digest a pretty significant hit on the other income line. So again, the team is working through the plans. We do have ambitious goals for next year. And what I would say is, stay tuned, is probably the best direction I can give you at this point in time. David Lewis : Okay, maybe just two quick follow-ups, Joe. The first is for you on the repo -- you completed the repo this quarter. Just given the operational performance of J&J and the company's historical discount, what are you thinking now with the share repo completed going forward? And then Ashley, just real quickly, can you just talk a little bit about the U.S. market dynamics within Vision? Two specific dynamics, you talked about pressure in the surgical business, to what extent is that IOL dynamics in the marketplace versus the LASIK franchise? That'd be super helpful. Thanks so much. Joseph Wolk : So David, with respect to the share repurchase, we are pleased to have the $5 billion board authorized program completed. It continues to be one of the four pillars within our capital allocation strategy. I would say in terms of pecking order, as you know, having covered us for years, it's probably the least of our preferred options, although it is still an option, simply because it doesn't provide us capabilities going forward, but we'll continue to evaluate that along with the dividend increase, the investment in R&D, as well as opportunistic acquisitions that makes sense from a value creation standpoint, but also a really good strategic fit that expands our portfolio. Ashley McEvoy : And thank you, David for the question on Vision. But before I get to that, I have to first acknowledge kind of the strong quarter for Medical Device in quarter three growing 5.3%. And, as Chris had mentioned, we did experience some forwared -buying in the Japan consumption. So, if you take that out, we're looking at around 4.5% growth, which is the strongest that we've had in four years. So, as you know, we've been on this journey since 2017 to really enhance our performance year-over-year. And when we look at '17, we exited 1.5% growth on revenue, and in '18 we exited 2.6%, and in 2019 to date we're tracking to a little bit north of 4%. So as I always say, I don't think our growth is going to be linear, but I do think that we've turned the corner, and that really is due to predominantly in the near term, the strategic choices that we're making to strengthen our competitiveness, and it's really about this very strong seasoned leadership team. We\u2019ve got five quarters underneath them, and a very, very strong focus on execution. So I think this is starting to have an effect. So to your question on Vision; Vision had a good quarter. I would say contact lens in particular had a very healthy quarter, really driven by very strong growth in the United States of around 6%. In surgery, we had very strong outside of U.S. performance, double digits. The U.S. surgical business is challenged really due to two fronts; number one, some competitive inroads and we are working to strengthen our commercial execution. In U.S., we strengthened that leadership team, revisited our programs, and we are also accelerating some innovations. We expect to have three meaningful innovations in premium IOLs and monofocal IOLs over the next 18 months. And to your earlier point point, yes, we do believe that we've seen some softening in the LASIK market in the United States. Thanks for the question. David. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thank you, David. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe first, can you talk about TREMFYA dynamics, particularly relative to SKYRIZI? The product obviously -- TREMFYA obviously ramping nicely, I know there\u2019s some investor concern though, that that ramp could be impacted by a strong launch from your competitor. So, just how are you thinking about price and volume for that business going forward? The second question was on liabilities. It seems like kind of these liabilities have somewhat dominated the narrative for the J&J story this year, what do you think the company can do to address that overhang, and what's the company's approach towards settlement? Because it seems like right now the mix of opioids, talc, and some others have overshadowed what seemed to be very strong underlying fundamentals of the company. Thank you. Joseph Wolk : So Jennifer, why don't you address Chris' question around TREMFYA, and maybe you can give him some Pharmaceutical perspective, and then I'll take up the litigation matters. Jennifer Taubert : Hi Chris and good morning everyone. First off, it was a really strong quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group, and I just wanted to highlight a couple of key points, the first being, sales of $10.9 billion, 6.5% operational growth. This was our sixth consecutive quarter with sales above $10 billion, and if you take a look at our growth excluding ZYTIGA, it was 10% and also with very strong contribution from the U.S. and the international markets, where actually we had 10% growth outside of the U.S. as well. Our growth was broadly based with 10 of our key brands growing at double-digit rates, which more than offset the erosion due to biosimilars in generics. Overall, our immunology business was up 10%, our oncology business, up 9%, and Neuroscience, up 8%. A few notable call-outs, STELARA had 31% growth, DARZALEX had 57%, IMBRUVICA 33% growth, TREMFYA, which I'll come back to, 70% growth, INVEGA SUSTENNA 15% and ERLEADA, 95% growth, so very strong performance across our base of business and across our key growth drivers. Additionally, it was a really nice quarter for the progression of our pipeline, and we had a number of significant approvals, as well as filings that are worth calling out. Most recently as of last Friday, we got approval for XARELTO to help prevent VTE in acutely medically ill patients. We got approval for INVOKANA for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. DARZALEX, we got approval for the combination regimen in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients, and for ERLEADA, we got approval for treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, which expands our opportunity for that product, so that it's not only in the non-metastatic space, but into the metastatic space as well. We also had a number of regulatory submissions and two breakthrough designations that were granted. So, strong performance for our key growth drivers, and good reasons for optimism on our pipeline progression as well. In terms of TREMFYA; our TREMFYA business grew 70% versus the third quarter, and in addition, we filed an application for use in active psoriatic arthritis in August, and so to date, we're really pleased with the launch progress and the trajectory. Based on the strength of the profile of the product that we've got, coupled with very strong longevity data that we have, we believe that we've got a really competitive offering that IL-23 is the right mechanism for psoriasis and other areas that we're exploring, and also, that we've got a very-very strong package to drive continued growth. I think in these settings before, we've discussed the strength of the package that we have with superiority data versus three separate mechanisms. So approval versus -- in our label, superiority data versus Humira as an anti-TNF, versus STELARA non-responders IL-12/23 mechanism, and then our most recent data versus Cosentyx, which is an IL-17 and PASI 90 at week 48. And now we actually have four years of data that further demonstrates the therapeutic longevity of the asset, and that's going to be presented next week. So when you take a look at it, we believe we've got a real competitive profile versus the IL-17. We've also got a competitive profile versus the other IL-23, and we don't see that they're bringing anything to the market that is any different. In fact, based on the strength of our data, plus now our four-year data and the strength of the access that we have in the market, we think that we're going to continue to compete very-very well in what it will arguably be a very competitive space. Joseph Wolk : Thanks Jennifer. Chris, with respect to your second question on litigation more broadly and what can the company do. So I think it's important, without going into too deep of a litany about the cases that are out there, there's three I'd say headline grabbers that folks have taken notice of. And it is important for me to just give a brief summary of the position on each, because they are unique in their own right. With respect to the RISPERDAL judgment that you heard last week, first of all, let's make sure people understand the benefits of RISPERDAL, what it provides for psychosis. It has for decades now been on WHO's list of most preferred medicines and the judgment itself, based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, would suggest it's very egregious. So we don't expect that to stand. We will appeal certainly the amount and you can expect that to come down, should precedent hold. With respect to opioids, you've seen two divergent paths there for us. So in Oklahoma, we thought that based on the theory of law and which was brought under in public nuisance, as well as the facts that underlie that case, where even the Attorney General of the State said many times during the court proceedings, this is not about Johnson & Johnson, it's about that there is an opioid crisis, where we have less than 1% market share. That's not just for the State of Oklahoma, but across the country. When those facts were ignored and we couldn't find a reasonable settlement approach. We decided to pursue with that case and we are currently appealing that case and have made motions to do that. In Ohio, you saw something different. We saw a reasonable amount in proportion to other companies that were involved as defendants. We were particularly pleased to see that the funds were going to victims of opioid addiction. And so for many reasons there, we thought the best path for all stakeholders was settlement, and that's something that we will always kind of take into account in terms of what is the best solution for all stakeholders, including investors who obviously want certainty. Lastly was talc; this to me is probably the poster child for how big a business plaintiff's attorneys have made this type of approach. If you think about the outstanding cases, product liability cases in the U.S. court system today, about 50% are related to life sciences or are against life science companies, when products have never been safer and have never been more effective. The plaintiff's bar in total has spent over $400 million this year alone in advertising on TV, trying to drum up the numbers in class action suits. It's become a $36 billion industry. And what you may not realize, you'll see the headlines, certainly when verdicts are ruled against us, and I will remind everyone that there is currently not any case that's been fully adjudicated that stands in judgment against us. But last week alone, there were three decisions that were in favor of the company, and you don't see headlines on that. So in that case, we're going to continue to defend a product that we know to be safe, that we know it does not cause cancer, and that's not just the opinions of Johnson & Johnson scientists, that's the opinion of respected institutions like the National Cancer Institute, the FDA, and numerous prestigious universities. So we'll continue to evaluate each situation for its unique merits. But what I can't underscore enough is, we've got a small great legal team working on these matters. As today's results hopefully demonstrate to all of you on the phone and anybody who is reading the press release, is that we continue to be focused as an organization of 135,000 associates, trying to bring better solutions, better innovation to healthcare. That will eventually win out. We're very strong in our conviction around that. It has for 133 years. We know how to navigate these matters, and we're going to stay focused at the task at hand. With that last point, it may be good, sometimes we get a question, especially as it relates to talc, if there's been any overhang on the business. And for that I'd like to turn it over to Thibaut, maybe just to give some quick commentary with respect to the Consumer business and whether he's seeing any impact from it. Thibaut Mongon : Sure. Good morning everyone. The short answer is no. We do not see any significant effect across the Consumer business. As Joe just referenced, our employees around the world in the consumer sector are hyper-focused on delivering personal health in a very differentiated way, with very strong brands that are rooted in science and endorsed by professionals. In Q3 as Chris highlighted earlier, we delivered solid growth in our key priority areas that we declared at the beginning of the year. You heard about 5.2% growth in OTC, 2% in beauty, strong performance by brands like TYLENOL, NEUTROGENA, AVEENO. Full perspective to ground you, the baby franchise represents only 12% approximately of our revenues, and approximately 80% of those sales outside the United States, where there is less of an impact from the U.S. events. So you see the performance of the business. In the U.S., we continue to gain share. In beauty and OTC we are outperforming the market. We are well positioned in segments that are growing 2% to 2.5% in the markets and segments where we compete. You also saw that we increased our adjusted IBT [ph] significantly this year, 210 [ph] basis points so far year-to-date at 22.4%. So we are focused on executing our strategy. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thanks Thibaut. Chris, thanks for the question, Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One for China, - one on China and one on MedTech for Ashley. So first on China, Joe, any color on what you're seeing across divisions there and your expectations going forward? Obviously there has been some concern about the environment in China, and just remind us as to how much China accounts for as a percent of total J&J sales, and I just had one follow-up for Ashley. Joseph Wolk : Yes sure, Larry. Good to speak with you. So China continues to perform extremely well for us. So if you look - if I strip out significant divestitures of LifeScan and ASP, our overall growth was about 15%. I would say Medical Devices, which we know is the number one company for medical devices in China, we were up around 19%, 14% in Pharmaceuticals and about 5% in consumer, so very healthy across the board. We have not seen any impacts on tariffs and we don't know of any that are pending around healthcare. So we've been fortunate in that way. We continue to monitor it. The business overall was $1 billion for the quarter. So that's I think a high watermark for that business, as it continues to go fairly strong in terms of growth levels. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's very helpful Joe. And Ashley, European surgery business has been growing outside the U.S. nicely, but has been soft in the U.S. So my question is, what turned that around in the U.S., and will these recent trends continue until you launch your surgical robot? Thanks for taking the question. Ashley McEvoy : Thanks Larry. I mean before I kind of get specifically into kind of the surgery business, I do think it's helpful to share - I had talked at the last quarter, some of our hotspots on how do we address some of those, and then will we look at some of the areas that are really on fire. As Joe mentioned in China, like our Asia business continues to perform double digits, and we actually performed high single-digit, if not double-digit, in all of our franchises, in orthopedics, in surgery, as well as in interventional. And as I talked last time, really, the U.S. is our largest market, how do we continue to accelerate growth there.  So, I am pleased to see that year-to-date, that business is up around 2.2%, and this time last year, that number was a little bit south of 1%. And then when I look at our global orthopedics business where we are, we do command the world-leading position in orthopedics. We've accelerated that revenue in 2019. So year-to-date that business is up around 1%, really fueled by very strong quarter. In quarter three, up of around 2.3%, which is our strongest quarter since 2016, which is growth acceleration versus a year ago, where that number was about down 1%. So if I turn my attention to surgery, I would say our energy business has a very strong performance, really double-digit growth OUS. In the U.S., we will be challenged until we get our digital surgery offerings out there. And then similarly for endocutters; endocutters globally had a softer quarter versus the second quarter, really due to some phasing between quarter two and quarter three, and due to a very healthy comp last year, where we grew 10% in endocutters. Similarly, we're seeing very strong performance outside of the United States, high single-digit, but we are challenged versus the robotic penetration happening in the United States. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thank you, Larry. I appreciate the question, Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I appreciate all the commentary on Medical Devices. I love to see the growth this quarter. Ashley, just a quick question for you, as we think about that 4.5% growth, you talked about like some one-timers. How should we think about the sustainability of this? I know there's probably going to be volatility quarter-to-quarter, but just wanted to make sure this level of growth isn't going to fall off for any sort of reason. So I am wondering if you could talk about this, as we look out over the next four to six quarters, the sustainability of that 4% to 5% growth level, or are there any headwinds at any particular quarter coming up that we should be thinking about? Ashley McEvoy : So thanks for the question. Danielle, and listen, it's really good to see a number four, and we're pleased with quarter three, and we're pleased with really kind of the year-over-the-year enhancement. So I feel confident in that continued year-over-year progression. I don't anticipate us having a perfect linear line every quarter-to-quarter. The market is just - we will have to adapt to the market. But I really think that we're going to accomplish that. What you're seeing is really the benefit of strength in commercial execution. But I would say what I'm equally bullish on, is really the innovation agenda. And when I look at 2019, I think we benefited from some really novel innovations in our circular -- powered circular stapler for complex oncology cases. We had a first in contact lens with a light adaptive lens. We are launching our cementless, which is a high-growing segment in knees in quarter three. In quarter four, we'll have some news in spine, related to our Symfony launch for our complex posterior cervical and deformity. So I really think that those are going to have an effect, but equally important is really what I look at the innovations coming out over the next, let's say 18 months. And we're going to have a first-in-kind, smart micro catheter in our electrophysiology business under QDOT, which is going to deliver about two to three times the amount of energy, and take the procedure from four hours to two hours. We're going to have another novel innovation in Vision, related to the first ever drug-eluting contact lens for allergy. More premium intraocular lens coming, and we're going to have some digital surgery robots in our orthopedics business really beginning with the filing in 2020, let alone all the digital surgery offerings that we have with Monarch and the future with Verb and Eye platform. So thanks for the question. Christopher DelOrefice : Thanks Danielle. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just as we think about margins, obviously posted a really strong quarter, it looks like Consumer and MedTech were the key drivers of the improvement. Just wondering if that level is sustainable here, or if there is room for further improvement in each of these segments as we look into 2020? And then on DARZALEX looking ahead into 2020, is it reasonable to assume that year-over-year growth in the U.S. should inflect positively next year, given the front-line label? Thanks. Joseph Wolk : May be Thibaut and Ashley, if you'd like to address your levels of investment with respect to your businesses and then Jennifer you can handle the DARZALEX question. Thibaut Mongon : Sure, I can start with Consumer, Terrence. On - as you saw, we are very focused on improving our profitability level. I just talked about the sequential improvement we are seeing this year. As I look at 2020, we expect to see moderate acceleration in the topline, with market growing around 3% and we remain focused on driving our productivity agenda. So that's the agenda for 2020. Joseph Wolk : Yes, I think that the best way to characterize it relative to this year, Terence, is that this year was the bigger lift in terms of profit improvement - profitability margins improving for the consumer unit. So you will still see continued improvement, as Thibaut mentioned, but not to the same degree you probably saw in 2019. Ashley McEvoy : And just to build, Terence, this is Ashley, on the kind of the investments and what the expectations are, I think we're seeing very strong performance in Asia. We've made continued investment in Asia, and continued investment in China. We command a leadership position in China and we command leadership position in emerging markets, and it's really nice to see emerging markets up 10% and China up 19% and we will continue to make those very, very select investments. And then in areas like commercial infrastructure around having a world class sales force and world-class professional education, I think we're seeing the investments that we made, particularly in new deployment models in the United States, having an effect. And then clearly in innovation, both in digital surgery, through the Auris acquisition, and what we're continuing to do with our Verb and Orthotaxy, and some robotic programs in spine, and as you know, we've invested about $12 billion in M&A since 2017 in Medical Devices to make sure that we're playing in the most attractive spaces. Joseph Wolk : To be fair Terence, it's a little bit of a tough question for our business leaders to answer at this point in time. As I mentioned at the outset, we're still developing our plans for 2020, and for us, when we go through those planning, we're really looking at what investment opportunities are available to us, in terms of fortifying not just the short term, but the long term. What's going to make us truly competitively advantaged two, three, five years down the road. So that's why it's a little bit difficult to answer. But we're always looking to make sure that we've got over sustained periods of time, sales growth that exceeds the market in the respective segments, and then profit a little bit better growth than sales growth. Jennifer Taubert : Hi Terrence. Our oncology business had another strong quarter and DARZALEX was really one of the key drivers of that, with 57% growth versus the third quarter of last year. As you noted, we've got a great opportunity to make strides in the front line setting. Right now DARZALEX is a leader in line 2+. However, at the end of June, we gained approval in the front line setting for transplant in eligible patients, in combination with REVLIMID and at the end of the third quarter we gained approval in front line for the transplant eligible patients in combination with Velcade and Thalidomide, are based on our CASSIOPEIA data. And so we're really looking to continue to expand DARZALEX across the various lines of therapy and in various combinations to really be the backbone of therapy. Importantly for us, and I believe the key growth driver for the future, we filed our subcu formulation, which is going to take us from a several hour infusion on this product, down to under five minutes. And so we think that's going to be an important catalyst for growth, particularly in the outpatient settings, the more community settings, and we're also importantly studying DARZALEX in amyloidosis, smoldering myeloma, so we think that there is both near-term, short-term growth, as well as continued long-term growth potential on this asset. So based on the strength of the performance to-date, the additional data that we're seeing and the opportunities that we have in the front line setting and growth potential, coupled with the subcu formulation that's coming up, we believe that there is very good reasons for a very strong, continued growth for DARZALEX going forward. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thanks Terrence. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to I guess clarify just some of the timing around the digital surgery platforms. I think Ashley mentioned filing for Orthotaxy in 2020. Just wanted to get some clarification there, and then also any updates on progress with Monarch and then timing around Verb? And I think you might have a Medical Device Day next year, just wondering what we should expect with that, and just kind of Verb and thoughts with Medtronic I guess showcasing their platform too? Ashley McEvoy : Thank you, Kristen for the question. So listen, I couldn't be more bullish around how J&J is going to create value in this space, and really kind of the goal that we're trying to achieve is really to make medical interventions smarter, less invasive, more personalized, quite frankly to change the standard of care, not just for the next 10 years, but to 20 years and 30 years. So it really starts with, as you know, a very strong footprint that we actually have today in - as a world leader in open surgery and a world leader in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. I'm very pleased to share that Monarch is off to a great start, as a first in, in endoluminal surgery. We've conducted over a thousand bronchoscopes using the Monarch system. You'll see in the chest, at the end of October, we will be sharing our post-market surveillance data, and so stay tuned for that. We have a very healthy pipeline with Monarch, for not just lung biopsies, but potentially lung treatment via ablation, and potential treatment via oncolytic viruses, so that program is well on its way. We also are looking at applications of Monarch in endourology for the treatment of kidney stones, and we also are assessing the potential application of [indiscernible] in GI endoscopy. So very encouraged with Monarch, equally encouraged with the acquisition of Auris as well as Verb. We brought in a new leader to head our Verb program, Kurt Azarbarzin. He's got over 30 years experience in minimally invasive surgery and robotics. It's pretty fun to watch Kurt and the community of Dr. Fred Moll, again one of the founders of Intuitive, Peter Shen, he has grown up on Ethicon instrumentation and then Andy Conrad from Verily, kind of put those thought leaders together with over 30 different key opinion leaders from around the world, who've been really assessing how we can create value with all of these assets over the next several years. So I am encouraged to say both programs have conducted - and I mean both programs both the [Auris-I] platform and Verb have conducted end-to-end procedures in multiple different indications in general surgery. We've gotten very good feedback from over 30 plus surgeons, and we're going to take the absolute best of all of those, as we in parallel advance both of those programs. Equally pleased to see Dr. Fred Moll engage with our orthopedics team. We plan to file our orthopedics program for filing middle of 2020. And so, when I take a step back, I really see us having a healthy cadence of news starting last year, with the launch of Monarch, every single year having meaningful news. We are completing our assessment, Kristen, as you had mentioned around the eye platform and Verb and how do we create the most amount of value. Right now, we're not changing any timelines until that assessment is complete, so stay tuned. Joseph Wolk : Great, thanks, Ashley. And may be just another update to Ashley's point on the progress of the Monarch platform, while it's early and limited revenue today, we're very pleased with the progress of the placement of systems, two times the amount year-to-date versus where we were in 2018. So, that continues to progress well from an adoption standpoint in the marketplace. Christopher DelOrefice : Thanks, Kristen. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning, congratulations on the strong quarter. I was hoping to start off around on the Pharma business. I just wanted an update on the generic/biosimilar headwind, you guys have called out a kind of $3 billion number for 2019. And is there any way you can help us think about where that headwind will sit, as we head into 2020? And then the second question, another pharma question just on XARELTO; congrats on the line extension. Any help there, just in terms of how you would perceive launching into this new indication? Are there any pricing considerations you need to undertake and can XARELTO return to growth? It has been a blockbuster that's been relatively anchored over the last number of quarters? Thanks a lot. Jennifer Taubert : Hi Josh, it's Jennifer. So as we take a look at this year, first on your question regarding sort of biosimilar and generic impact. We think we're seeing about $2 billion of incremental impact from biosims and generics. This is a little bit less than what we had anticipated this year. However, the number of generic approvals and the erosion rates are starting to catch up. And so we think as we enter into next year, we'll work through the rest of that. So part of it - a little bit of it's going to carry over into till 2020, and then we'll be working through and be done with that. As it relates to XARELTO, we are very excited about the new indication. This is actually the eighth indication for XARELTO and that product really remains unmatched in the oral space, in terms of the number of indications. So the asset has indications in AFib, VTE prevention and treatment, and then also in CAD, PAD. So how to think about the acute medically ill indication? First of all, it broadens XARELTO's base of indications across these three areas, and it's that's really unmatched. And so that can help from a formulary and from a payer perspective. And then within the market, there are over 7 million Americans that are hospitalized each year with acute medical illnesses and so these patients are at increased risk of clots for up to three months post discharge. So currently they are treated in hospital, with a product like Lovenox, but because of the complications and the difficulties with injections, they typically go untreated, once they leave the hospital. What we now know from our studies and our data, is that it's much better for these patients to actually be treated for about 31 to 39 days, following their medical illness. And so this is a - we believe that patients will start on XARELTO in hospital, when they're there with the acute medical illness, and then our goal is a transition out of hospital with a script and continue on oral medication for that 31 to 39 days. Now you may have the question, how do we go about doing this? The good news is, XARELTO 10 milligram, which is the right dose for this indication, is already available on hospital formularies, that's the dose that we've had in the market now for a number of years, for post knee and hip surgeries. So we do have very broad availability in hospitals, formulary access and also payer access for this. We've also got teams that are already deployed to hospitals across the other range of indication sets. So in our typical way, we do next day launches. So the team is already out in the markets, getting ready and working on this indication, as well as continuing to drive uptake in the paradigm-changing CAD, PAD indication, and fighting out for a competitive share in both AFib, as well as the other VTE treatment and prevention indication. So we feel very good that we reached flat this year, that's obviously not where we want to be, but we are moving forward and getting past some of the donut hole and rebate issues, and we do believe there is an opportunity for growth for this asset as we take a look, and completing the year and going forward. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thanks Josh. I appreciate the question, Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So just two follow-ups, if I could, one on the digital surgery side, Ashley, I appreciate the color on the strategy across the major business lines. The one that I wanted to ask about was just spine. You have a partnership with Brainlab, and that continues to progress. You have pretty solid set of new products that you mentioned are going to drive improving growth in spine. But just if you could, what amount of the competitive pressure there is coming from this sort of increase in robots in that space, and how do you think about that strategically? And then just one follow-up for Joe, if I could? Ashley McEvoy : Sure. Thank you, Matt. So spine, we're number two in the world in spine. We have been challenged. Our revenue performance has been challenged, and really what we've been working on is, one to give very dedicated focus to - if I'll call it like the top six markets in spine, that are really going to be the growth contributors in stabilizing those, from a leadership point of view, from a commercial execution point of view, from a clinical acumen of how we engage with spine surgeons and then rebuilding the spine portfolio. And so, I think we are starting to see the fruit of that on stabilization. And we mentioned some of - Chris had mentioned some of the innovations around VIPER PRIME, around CONDUIT Interbody cages, around Symfony which is going out in quarter four, and so clearly digital surgery is also going to be important that we launch that. To date, that has had a very minimal effect. As you know and you referenced, we do have a strategic partnership with Brainlab, which is offering us an end-to-end navigation solution, and we actually in quarter three entered into a co-marketing distribution and R&D agreement with Tinavi, who is the market leader in orthopedics robotics in China and actually is the only arm based robotic technology approved for spine in China. So clearly, we feel like we have to have a digital surgery offering as well in spine. Matt Miksic : That's helpful. And the question for Joe, if I could, just I understand from your comments on the call that you're working through the plan for next year and it's still not a full outlook for next year, but just if you could help us understand perhaps the puts and takes and how you think about spending as you've mentioned balancing near-term to long-term, again some of the year-over-year challenges you may have elsewhere in the P&L that would be super helpful just to maybe walk us through R&D and SG&A and any potential ForEx or opportunities you have in gross margin just at a high level Joe, that would be super helpful? Joseph Wolk : Yes so, I appreciate the question Matt. I think I'm going to be respectful to the teams on letting them finalize their plans. But I would say in terms of puts and takes I feel very good about the top line growth. We need to see where the net of all the incremental generic and biosimilar erosions will eventually land as we go through the 4th quarter here that will give us a pretty good insight. As you saw, with Medical Devices we expect to be around the markets of 4% to 5% is where we see that market overall. As you know, some of that is influenced by some of the higher segments where we yet don't have a, I'd say a pronounced presence but working our way towards that. But again, Ashley and the team have their line of sight in continued acceleration there. Maybe as a step back for the overall pharma market, we see about 4% growth for next year. And then in Consumer you've heard from Thibaut that we expect to be competitive with the market, which we anticipate will be around 3%, but the focus there has been on prioritization to skin health and self-care and improving the profitability profile, We're going to continue to invest in R&D, that's been a bias of ours for a number of years, you can see that when we issue our P&Ls that there is a disproportionate share and that's where we grow as a percent of sales more often than not. And we're going to continue to look for those opportunities to advance the pipeline. I was really thrilled with the press release today, not simply because of the financial results, although, I was very pleased with those. I would say it was the 15 items that were listed across our businesses of notable advancements in our pipeline and that really just bodes well for the future. So, Matt, I appreciate the question, I apologize, I can't give you a little bit more detailed guidance today, but stay tuned for our report out in January and we'll be pretty specific then. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thanks, Matt. I appreciate it. Rob, next question please. Operator : And your next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Oh, thanks very much for taking the question. Just two really quick ones; given the strength in Medical Devices, I was wondering if you could comment on two quick things. One, you had very strong growth in hips and knees outside the United States. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what drove that incremental growth? Was it market share, was it market strength? And then just one last one on Verb, I was just wondering, when you think you'll be able to be in a position to provide us with a more detailed update on the timelines for filing and approval? And I ask in part, because your comments on endocutters, and in part because one of the other large competitors has now provided pretty specific timelines, so, just those two quick device questions? Thank you. Ashley McEvoy : Sure, thanks Bob. I think I'm pleased with the performance that we've had in hips, around 3%. We have a strong portfolio in hips and we're really leading the way on the anterior approach. We actually just completed a new acquisition of JointPoint, which is going to help us with kind of an intra-operative software program, to enable a more digitally oriented procedure in hips. I'd say hips is pretty balanced between OUS and U.S. Knees, I am encouraged. This is our first quarter in several quarters that we actually posted growth in knees of around 2%, really fueled by OUS performance. The U.S. I'll come back to that. ATTUNE is performing well in the U.S., we've seen a pivot and start in primary and revision in ATTUNE. We're working off some legacy transition in some of our legacy knee brands in Sigma. Really what's enabling knees is just a couple of things; one, strength in commercial execution in our top six markets. It's also about innovation. We have a very strong foundation in our ATTUNE knee platform that we've invested over 10 years in bringing to market. It's performing very well from an efficacy and safety point of view. We now have a full portfolio in the ATTUNE Revision, both fixed bearing and rotating platform and we've also launched our cementless in quarter three. And then you could add to that, Bob, you can see next year when we'll have cementless in fixed bearing, and we'll have our digital surgery offering in knees, I feel pretty confident that our join platform will start to get back to the market performance. As it relates to Verb, we have been progressing Verb and all of the milestones to bring this to market. We have been preparing for kind of validation studies. We've been in active discussions with all regulatory authorities, both in the United States as well as in Europe. As I mentioned, we brought in a new CEO of Verb, Kurt Azarbarzin, about 60 days ago. So we've been letting him get underneath the hood of what needs more focus, what needs acceleration. Very pleased with, again, the customer feedback from Verb. What we've done is, we've brought in the combination of Auris. There are leaders with Dr. Fred Moll and Kurt and Verily, our partner, Verily are creating kind of this connected OR [ph] of the future, and we're in the middle of assessing how do we really optimize all of these assets to make a difference in healthcare systems. So we're still in the middle of that, and I expect to have that completed before the end of the year. Right now, we're holding to the timelines, but I expect probably in quarter one with some updates, we will keep you posted. Thanks for the question, Bob. Christopher DelOrefice : Great, thanks, Ashley. Rob, we have time for one last question, and then after that I will turn it over to Joe Wolk for some closing remarks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Hi, good morning. I'll keep it to one question and thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe for Thibaut and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but your International Consumer business seems to lag year-to-date about 1% growth. Can you give us a little detail on why the international growth has been a little slower? And then you've alluded to bit of a pickup in market growth next year in consumer, what are the big factors driving that better growth? Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, thank you for the question. Regarding -- as you said, we had a very strong quarter in the U.S., a bit softer outside of the U.S., a number of factors internal and external -- externally we see some softness in some emerging markets, Latin America, especially, and we are rolling out our baby, our new Johnson's Baby brand around the world. The rollout will be completed by the end of this year and this has an impact on our shipments outside of the U.S. In the U.S. we have already completed this rollout last year as we just talked about. Regarding next year, we anticipate modest acceleration in the markets and geographies in which we compete, from 2% to 2.5% this year to 3% next year. And as Joe just mentioned, we are finalizing our plans to grow competitively in these markets while continuing to work on our profitability agenda, so we can improve our profitability and at the same time invest behind growth opportunities we see in our priority areas. Great, thank you, Jayson. I appreciate the question. Joe, final comments from you? Joseph Wolk : Sure. Well, first let me thank all of you on the webcast today for your time and your continued interest in Johnson & Johnson. Ashley, Thibaut, Jennifer, Chris and I were certainly proud to discuss the quarterly results and also engage in discussing the overall health of our business. What you hopefully saw from today's press release and the discussion that we're about to conclude is that you have a focused organization here on delivering transformational innovation for the betterment of healthcare and much broader society. We manage through any challenges that we face to deliver those results, not just over one year or five years, but many, many years, many, many decades and hopefully you saw that on display today. So again, thank you for your time and look forward to the next encounter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Christopher DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K, which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Our SEC filings, including our 2018 Form 10-K and our most recent 10-Q, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Alex will then provide some perspective on our overall results and business highlights for the year. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment, and our guidance for 2020. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. Worldwide sales were $20.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 1.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 2.6% as currency had a negative impact of 0.9 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.1%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.4% worldwide, 2.7% in the U.S., and 4.1% outside the U.S.  For the full year 2019, consolidated sales were $82.1 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2018. Operationally, full year sales grew 2.8%, with currency having a negative impact of 2.2 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 0.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 0.7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. increased by 5.3%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.5% worldwide, 2.3% in the U.S., and 6.7% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.50 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.12 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.88, representing decreases of 6.4% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3%. Regarding the full year, 2019 net earnings were $15.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.63. 2019 adjusted net earnings were $23.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.68, up 4.5% and 6.1%, respectively, versus full year 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8.8%. Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2019 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.6 billion, growing 2.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.4%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.6% due primarily to strong performance in our OTC franchise. Growth outside of the U.S. was 1.3%. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 5% operationally, and on an adjusted basis. In the U.S., OTC growth was around 10% and is growing share in multiple products, such as Adult Tylenol driven by rapid-release gels, PEPCID, and Zarbee's. However, U.S. growth was aided by about 200 basis points of stocking due to incremental distribution and trade promotion programs. The Beauty franchise grew 4.3% or just under 1% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of Dr. Ci Labo and the RoC divestiture. NEUTROGENA delivered strong performance globally with growth of 4% outside the U.S. driven by anti-aging and cleansing innovation in EMEA as well as hand and body moisture category strength in the Asia Pacific region. In the U.S., share and market growth were largely offset by lapping of prior year new product pipeline builds and higher 2019 trade investment in NEUTROGENA.  Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care declined 9.3% globally or negative 7% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. This decline was primarily due to continued competitive pressures as well as comparisons to prior year relaunch activities, most notably in the United States. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.5 billion grew 4.4%, enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. The segment delivered its seventh consecutive quarter above $10 billion in revenue. Sales grew in the U.S. about 4% and increased outside the U.S. by almost 5%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 180 and 310 basis points, respectively.  Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above-market levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of over 10%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing about 45% globally. The U.S. grew almost 38%, with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline medication for the multiple myeloma transplant-ineligible population.  The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains. IMBRUVICA grew over 26% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. In the U.S., based on third quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained above 7 points of market share in CLL line 1 therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 13%, with declines of almost 45% in the U.S. due to generic competition, which was partially offset by continued strong growth of almost 13% outside the U.S.  We continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which generated global sales of $116 million in Q4 and $332 million for the full year, primarily in the United States. We continue to grow market share in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, gaining over 2 points in the U.S. this quarter. Sales in the U.S. reflects the first full quarter for the approved indication for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are also pleased with the launch progress in EMEA where ERLEADA is now available in 12 countries. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of just over 6%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of about 16% due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. STELARA growth of almost 19% was primarily driven by the Crohn's disease indication, where market shares increased by 6 points in the U.S. versus the fourth quarter of 2018. In October, we received U.S. FDA approval of STELARA for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. SIMPONI ARIA delivered sales growth of 7.6%, driven by strong market growth and SIMPONI ARIA share gains in the U.S. TREMFYA grew over 55% and achieved an 8.3% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2018. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 15%, with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO. Patient demand continues to build, and the unmet need remains very high. New patient starts continue to steadily increase each month with over 3,500 patients being treated to date. Further, we are pleased to report that in December, SPRAVATO was approved in Europe for adults with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 9.6%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 9.5%, primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO was flat with volume increases offset by rebates primarily due to an increase in the legislative rate for the doughnut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and doughnut hole utilization. In our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio, sales declined 6.2% as a result of a distributor model change in the U.S. to realize efficiencies by leveraging our distribution capabilities. This change negatively impacted sales growth by about 800 basis points, with sales growth of 2% when adjusting for this onetime impact. We continue to see strong share growth for OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And when adjusting for the onetime distributor model impact, their worldwide sales were about 10% and 30%, respectively. Portfolio growth was also impacted by declining sales in TRACLEER as a result of continued generic competition. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 0.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.7% worldwide. Onetime items negatively impacted growth in the quarter by about 70 basis points, largely related to a bleed down of the forward buying in Q3 in Japan ahead of the consumption tax change, which primarily impacted our Vision business. The majority of this has sold through in Q4, with the remainder expected to occur in Q1 2020. Additionally, on a year-on-year basis, we are pleased to report that Medical Devices has accelerated underlying sales growth worldwide by 130 basis points, with the second half of 2019 delivering 4% growth. Interventional Solutions grew over 13% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business, achieving about 14% growth worldwide and almost 16% for the year, continuing its trend of double-digit growth for the 11th consecutive year. Growth was strong in all regions, driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Additionally, our CERENOVUS business delivered its sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong market growth and new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Vision grew 0.9% or 3% when adjusting for the negative impact of the Japan consumption tax forward buy I mentioned earlier. Growth was primarily driven by contact lenses, which grew 2.6% globally or 5% adjusted for the bleed of the Japan consumption tax forward buy, led by double-digit growth of daily disposables in the OASYS family. For the year, contact lens grew almost 5%, which we expect to be in line with the overall market, representing the fourth consecutive year that contact lens has grown at or above the market. In surgical vision, we saw continued strong OUS growth in the cataract business due to above-market performance in IOLs, primarily in Asia Pacific. This was offset by weak U.S. performance due to competitive pressures and lower market growth in refractive surgery.  We continue to see positive momentum in Orthopaedics, delivering growth for the quarter of 1.2%. On an annual basis, each major platform accelerated versus the prior year, and adjusted growth for this franchise improved by 180 basis points. This progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance. Hips grew 4.2%, driven by our leadership position in the Anterior Approach; continued strong demand of our primary stem, ACTIS; and enabling technologies such as the KINCISE Surgical Automated System and Joint Point navigation system. Knees growth was 1.4% in the quarter, driven by strong performance of new innovations such as ATTUNE Revision, ATTUNE S+ and the ATTUNE Cementless rotating platform, which launched at the end of Q3. OUS growth of 3.2% was led by Asia Pacific. Additionally, the United States returned to growth this quarter.  Trauma growth of 2.5% globally was driven by market growth, supported by strong adoption of newer innovations such as our Femoral Neck System. Spine declined 5.8%, with the U.S. being the primary driver, partially due to not repeating a onetime Q4 2018 favorable pricing-related true-up, which negatively impacted global growth by 250 basis points. Excluding this impact, performance for the quarter was in line with the full year. While we lost share in the quarter, we continue to see positive uptake of newer products and are pleased with the strong start of our newly launched SYMPHONY surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures.  Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopaedics. U.S. pure price in Spine declined about 3% after adjusting for last year's pricing-related true-up. Trauma price was consistent with the Q3 decline of 2%. Price in hips and knees both improved compared to Q3 at negative 1% and flat, respectively. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery delivered global growth of over 3%, led by biosurgery growth of about 4% with growth in all regions, led by Asia Pacific share gains and market growth. However, growth in the quarter was tempered as SURGIFLO continued to ramp back up in the United States. Energy and endocutters grew approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, with OUS growth driven by share gains and new products in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by competitive pressure in the United States. Wound closure grew over 2%, driven by continued strong market growth in China as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures. As expected, selling days had an immaterial impact on our global growth rates in the fourth quarter. In 2020, selling days will negatively impact Q1 Medical Devices growth by over 50 basis points, with the majority being offset in Q2. I would now provide some commentary on our earnings for the year. Please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $8.68 reflects reported growth of 6.1% and operational growth of 8.8%, exceeding the high end of both our reported and operational adjusted EPS guidance range from October, driven by our strong performance. Consistent with our guidance, we did see a slight decline in adjusted pretax operating margins of 30 basis points, driven by investment in digital surgery in Medical Devices. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2019 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 170 basis points versus 2018. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices at 35.4% is higher than the previous year primarily due to increased divestiture gains in 2019, partially offset by an increase in investments in digital surgery. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 200 basis points to 40%, driven by reduced divestiture gains and higher cost of products sold due to the negative impact of currency. Consumer margins improved by 90 basis points to 21.4%, driven by planned prioritization and spending reductions, partially offset by reduced divestiture gains in 2018. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019, please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 fourth quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $1.88, a decrease of 4.6% versus the fourth quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was $1.91, down 3% versus fourth quarter 2018. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by an increase in amortization expense, partially offset by favorable segment mix. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of planned prioritization in the Consumer business and favorable segment mix, partially offset by increased investment in the Medical Devices business. R&D investment was consistent year-over-year with slightly lower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business offset by increased investment in digital solutions in the Medical Device business.  Net interest expense was lower by $50 million, primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements, partially offset by reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances. The change in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, higher unrealized gains on securities, partially offset by lower gains from divestitures.  Regarding taxes, in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 tax rate of 2.6%. The current quarter includes an estimated tax expense for the transition provisions of Swiss tax reform partially offset by reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional impacts of recently issued regulations associated with U.S. tax reform. We encourage you to reference our 10-K for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.7%, relatively consistent with the same period last year, which was 11.1%. Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the fourth quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.6% to 27.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the impact of divestiture gains in Q4 of last year. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 830 basis points, driven by the LifeScan divestiture gain reported in Q4 2018 as well as an increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in 2019. Consumer margins declined by 280 basis points, primarily driven by the divestiture of RoC in Q4 2018. The slight increase in Pharmaceutical margins of 30 basis points was primarily driven by reduced milestone payments.  That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.  I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be highlighting our fourth quarter and full year performance. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in 2019, exceeding the financial performance metrics that we set at the beginning of the year. Now we accomplished this while also making strategic investments that advance the pipeline of opportunities and innovation across all 3 of our business segments and as we faced a variety of challenges : from debates about the health care system in our country to uncertainty with global trade, to today's litigious environment, to name a few. Now I'm very proud that despite the challenges we still remain focused and delivered on our credo, commitments and responsibilities to our patients, employees, communities and shareholders, ultimately driving our purpose to advance health for humanity. And I'm confident that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and solid foundation as we move into 2020 and beyond. We remain focused on the long term, a mindset we've maintained for more than a century; a mindset that is directly linked to our focused execution, our relentless pursuit of innovation, our talented and passionate people, our culture of caring for the world and our unwavering focus on value creation for all our stakeholders. In fact, I'm proud to highlight that 2019 marked our 36th consecutive year of adjusted operational earnings growth for Johnson & Johnson. Now this performance is indicative of the strength of our broad-based business, and we remain focused on driving the next generation of innovation across our entire portfolio in new markets, in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete and in the markets where we lead, which include our 26 platforms that each deliver $1 billion or more in sales annually. In Pharmaceuticals, our strong track record of success continued again in 2019 as our pharma segment outpaced the market, growing operationally at 5.8%, which more than offset the loss of exclusivity due to biosimilar competition and generic erosion as well as new competitive entrants and other market pressures. Now it's important to note that our robust growth can be attributed to volume, not price, and our sales growth is a reflection of the increased number of patients we're reaching with our transformational medicines for unmet needs. This strong growth not only enabled us to deliver life-saving and life-changing medicines to people around the globe, but it also enabled us to become the third-largest pharmaceutical company in the world, retain our number one leadership position in the U.S. and be recognized as the number one pharmaceutical company on Fortune Magazine's annual most admired companies list.  Our pharma investments in R&D continued to fuel exceptional growth as well. We achieved double-digit growth for 10 key products and delivered strong performance across all regions, including in both developed and emerging markets. We're very proud and excited that we gained approval to launch 2 new transformational medicines : SPRAVATO for treatment-resistant depression and BALVERSA for metastatic urothelial cancer. We also continue to maximize the value in our market brands, submitting numerous filings and receiving approvals for line extensions for key brands, including STELARA, DARZALEX and ERLEADA, many with peak sales potential that is greater than $500 million.  And we continue to expand our portfolio with strategic licensing and acquisition of new assets and platforms, including cusatuzumab from argenx, an investigational antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; a gene-regulation platform for MeiraGTx; and bermekimab from XBiotech Inc., an anti-IL-1 alpha in Phase II development to treat atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. With this industry-leading pipeline, our commercial capabilities and robust R&D productivity, I'm confident that we are well positioned to continue delivering sustained long-term above-market growth in 2020 and beyond Now 2019 marked a year of significant transformation for the consumer health business. We reestablished our brand and purpose and made strategic decisions that over time will accelerate growth, reduce complexity and improve operating margins. Fueled by science-based, professionally endorsed brands and strong consumer insights, we placed a concerted focus throughout 2019 on establishing a clear plan and path to achieve benchmark profitability in 2020, and the segment is already well on its way, delivering 90 basis points of adjusted pretax margin improvement for the year.  Additionally, we successfully integrated the acquisitions of Zarbee's, Inc., a leader in naturally based over-the-counter remedies; and the Dr. Ci Labo line of dermocosmetic skin care products, strengthening our position in these higher-growth categories. Our U.S. Consumer business continues to grow above the market, and our priority areas of Beauty and OTC delivered solid operational growth for the year. I'm also pleased to share that Medical Devices accelerated growth again in 2019. As a result of our relentless focus on execution, innovation and portfolio management, our underlying growth was just under 4%. Now our improved performance was driven by electrophysiology achieving its 11th consecutive year of double-digit growth, contact lens which delivered growth at or above the market for the fourth straight year, energy and endocutters businesses growing mid-single digits and improved performance in Orthopaedics with each major platform accelerating compared to 2018.  During the year, we also fortified our commitment and accelerated our entry into one of the fastest growing health care categories and exciting transformative field of medicine, digital surgery. Consistent with our historical pioneering spirit in Medical Devices, we are focused on the next frontier of surgery. The acquisition of Auris Health, Inc., a developer of robotic technologies currently in lung cancer, accelerated our entry into robotics as part of the digital surgery ecosystem designed to make medical interventions smarter, less invasive and more personalized to elevate the standard of care. Additionally, just last month, we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining stake in Verb Surgical to further strengthen our ecosystem.  Now we also successfully launched critical products across each franchise throughout 2019, including the ATTUNE Cementless Knee system; our first-of-its-kind ACUVUE OASYS contact lens with TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT technology; the industry's first powered circular stapler, ECHELON; and the VIZIGO steerable sheath in our market-leading electrophysiology business. Our team continues to focus on improving our cadence of innovation as well as our portfolio optimization, which included the completion of the Advanced Sterilization Products divestiture and the execution of more than 50 acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we expect will further augment our future growth. We are committed to building upon this momentum in 2020. And I'm pleased to share that we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13 to highlight the strategies that we believe will drive further growth and provide additional insights into the team's plans in digital surgery. Looking ahead, across all 3 business segments, we know we've got more work to do, but we are committed to continuing to deliver above-market growth in our Pharmaceutical business, broadening the reach of our Consumer business and meeting the full potential of our Medical Devices business. And one of the most critical factors in achieving the goals of all of our business strategies is sustaining our investment in innovation. And once again, in 2019, we achieved record levels of investment, investing more than $11 billion in research and development. And across all industries, we remain 1 of the top 10 global companies that invest at the highest levels in R&D and innovation. Across Johnson & Johnson, we recognize the powerful impact that technology, innovation and health care breakthroughs have in creating meaningful change in people's lives and establishing a competitive differentiation within the industry. Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that all of these many accomplishments would not have been possible without the efforts, passion and engagement of our approximately 132,000 global Johnson & Johnson colleagues who continue to demonstrate a commitment to delivering health care solutions that benefit patients, consumers and communities around the world. Our purpose-driven credo-based culture puts patients and people first, and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees and work to consistently cultivate the world's best, healthiest and most engaged workforce. The fact that our Johnson & Johnson colleagues are truly the driving force behind our successful performance and in fulfilling our purpose is something that we never, never take for granted and always celebrate. We share the common objective of always making the health and well-being of the patients and consumers who use our products every day our number one priority, and it has been this way for the last 134 years. We are on the front lines of developing medicines and revolutionary products that are literally saving people's lives. And we're working to prevent cancer, offer less invasive surgeries and to end Ebola and HIV. This is what the world expects of us, and this is what our global workforce is united around, committed to and prepared to do. Now putting the needs of those we serve first also means protecting our shared environment and natural resources. We know that human health is directly linked to the health of the planet. Healthy people and communities go hand in hand with a healthy environment. This is why we are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, products and supply chain, with 2020 targets to reduce carbon emissions by 20% and procure 35% of electricity from renewable resources. Looking over the long term, we are optimizing our operations to improve water and energy efficiency while focusing on sustainable design and reduction in product packaging as well, all with the goal of delivering better health for people everywhere. So now I'd like to close where I began. In spite of the numerous industry challenges we faced throughout 2019, I'm very pleased that we remain focused on meeting the needs of patients and consumers globally, delivering value to all of our stakeholders, innovating, driving growth and achieving solid performance. Our sustainable business model is built for the long term and provides us with increased confidence about our business, our strategic direction and the health care industry in what may sometimes feel like uncertain times. You have our unwavering commitment that we will hold ourselves accountable to fulfill all of our credo responsibilities where we always keep the patient at the center of everything we do and also ensure the continued long-term success of Johnson & Johnson. We have an incredible opportunity to play a leading role in defining and driving the future of health care and putting it within the reach of everyone everywhere. This is why we are so very excited and confident about 2020 and beyond. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I'll now turn it over to Joe who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2020. Thank you. Joe? Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Alex. Hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I will be providing additional context around our 2019 performance, including our year-end cash position and the capital allocation actions that we executed throughout the year and then conclude with our guidance for 2020. As Alex and Chris mentioned, we delivered solid fourth quarter results, which capped a strong year of performance for Johnson & Johnson. Our full year results reflect a continued commitment to our long-term strategic objectives. Throughout the quarter and the year, we maintained our focus on delivering life-saving and life-changing products to patients and consumers across the globe. Heading into 2020, we are confident in our overall strategy and ability to drive results across the enterprise that will yield strong shareholder returns. Our solid results during the year generated strong cash flow, our highest level ever of free cash flow, of nearly $20 billion. With respect to our cash position, at the end of 2019, we had approximately $8.4 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $19.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27.7 billion of debt. Although we don't provide cash flow guidance, for transparency, as we come off a record year of free cash flow generation, we do expect a decline in 2020 of approximately 10% as we are planning for a payment related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, as previously disclosed. In 2019, we executed on all 4 elements of our capital allocation strategy. Our first objective within that framework is to invest in growth opportunities to solidify and advance our current business. Delivering transformative health care solutions and creating access is the top priority for Johnson & Johnson. And as Alex mentioned, we invested more than $11 billion in R&D during 2019.  As investors in Johnson & Johnson know, delivering a competitive and increasing dividend is a capital allocation priority for us. In 2019, we returned almost $10 billion to investors, which is approximately 50% of our free cash flow, increasing the quarterly dividend by 5.6%.  Once we've satisfied our dividend objectives, we seek M&A opportunities where our capabilities can create compelling value. During the year, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions totaling almost $6 billion to further strengthen our portfolio, which Alex outlined earlier in the call. Finally, after executing on these 3 important capital allocation priorities, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders, such as the $5 billion share repurchase program we began in December of 2018 and concluded in the third quarter of 2019. Let's move the discussion to guidance and information to assist your financial modeling for the year ahead. I'll begin with some qualitative comments that we considered in our outlook. First, our projected sales growth includes the benefit of an additional 2 to 3 shipping days associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. This will be partially offset by a SKU rationalization program in our Consumer segment. As part of our efforts to further improve profitability in 2020, the Consumer segment will continue to invest in platforms where we have differentiated brands with the greatest potential. Therefore, we plan to rationalize approximately 10% of the SKUs across the global portfolio, translating to a negative impact on 2020 top line growth of slightly over 100 basis points for the segment. This program will be primarily focused outside the U.S., with a larger impact coming in the second half of the year in the baby and Beauty franchises. Considering both the additional shipping days associated with a 53rd fiscal week and the consumer SKU rationalization program, the net impact is approximately 50 to 100 basis points of benefit to the company's sales growth outlook. Specific to each segment, our adjusted sales guidance also assumes continued above-market performance in our Pharmaceutical segment, driven by continued strong growth from key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA due to increased penetration and new indications; continued acceleration of sales growth in Medical Devices generated by recent launches and improved execution. And in the Consumer Health business, we will continue to grow above the market in the U.S. while executing the SKU rationalization program to position the segment for benchmark profitability.  Given these factors, we expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year of between 5.0% and 6.0% or 5.5% at the midpoint. The adjusted operational sales growth of 5% to 6% is on a constant-currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. Considering a negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures, which we estimate at 50 basis points, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $85.8 billion to $86.6 billion. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.11, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4% and 5% compared to 2019 or $85.4 billion to $86.2 billion. Let's now discuss earnings per share. As you can see on your screen, here's a slide depicting the components and assumptions included in our 2020 EPS guidance. Using the sales growth guidance I just referenced provides approximately $0.40 growth to EPS. The next column is based on expected operating margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points, which translates to an incremental $0.25 of contribution, net of continued investments across our segments. Operating margin improvement will be primarily driven by continued efforts to improve manufacturing capabilities; optimize sales, marketing and administrative expenses; and the consumer SKU rationalization just discussed. This results in strong adjusted operational EPS growth for the core business of $0.65 or 7.5% versus the prior year.  Offsetting those two operating components is the anticipated reduced level of other income of approximately $0.30 compared to 2019. You may recall that we benefited from a large divestiture gain from the sale of our Advanced Sterilization Products business in the second quarter of 2019. The final element to this EPS waterfall chart is the 2020 benefit we will have from the share repurchase program completed in 2019, which adds $0.05 to EPS compared to 2019, resulting in an adjusted operational EPS of $9.08 at the midpoint or a growth rate of 4.6%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.03 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4%. Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of additional P&L items to better provide insight into our full year 2020 guidance. As referenced earlier, for 2020, we are expecting our adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points while still prioritizing investment in our business that accelerates and further strengthens our pipeline of new products for the long term. Although we are continuously evaluating external value-creating opportunities, for purposes of your models, we currently assume no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash and are therefore comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between 0 and $100 million.  As a reminder, other income and expense is the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as litigation, investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2020 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This is lower than 2019 as we had elevated levels of divestiture gains, and we do not expect an event of that magnitude in 2020. Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020, excluding special items, is approximately 17.5% to 18.5% or higher than where we ended 2019, driven by expected changes in the mix of global earnings and miscellaneous onetime benefits not expected to reoccur in 2020. Considering all these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $9 to $9.15 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.7% to 5.4%. Again, while not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS, using exchange rates from last week, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. Therefore, our estimate for 2020 reported adjusted EPS is between a range of $8.95 to $9.10 per share or $9.03 per share at the midpoint. As a final comment, our guidance assumes no formal share repurchase program at this time. I wanted to provide this reminder since the last time I looked, street estimates utilized an average share count, which is significantly lower than what we are assuming for our 2020 guidance. We estimate the average diluted shares outstanding to be largely in line with the fourth quarter 2019 share count or 2.67 billion shares. Although we do not provide quarterly guidance, there are a few factors for you to consider in your models beyond the selling day fluctuations Chris mentioned in his remarks for Medical Device. For sales, you can expect the fourth quarter of 2020 to have the benefit of the additional shipping days, partially offset by the consumer SKU rationalization program that we are projecting throughout the year, but more pronounced in the back half. With respect to earnings, the first quarter of 2019 included an equity gain related to the consumer acquisition of Dr. Ci Labo, and the second quarter of 2019 included the gain associated with the ASP divestiture in Medical Devices. We don't anticipate similar events for other income and expense in the first half of 2020 but would expect elevated levels of other income aligned to today's guidance in the second half of 2020. Lastly, based on today's spot rates, currency will have a more negative impact in the first half of 2020. That concludes prepared remarks of our financial summary of 2019 results and 2020 guidance. Our 2019 results reinforce our confidence in our broad-based business as we head into 2020, and we look forward to delivering continued value on behalf of all stakeholders. As Alex mentioned, we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13, and I look forward to seeing all of you in person at this exciting event, which will be held in New York City this year. For your planning purposes and based on investment community feedback, please note that we will be highlighting our Consumer segment at consumer-focused events, such as notable CPG conferences this year. A special thank you to our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their tireless efforts and commitment who make the results we have attained possible and the outlook so bright. I will now turn the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A. Christopher DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. The first was just on pharma. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectations for growth in 2020? I guess, specifically, what are you expecting in terms of patent exploration headwinds for this year? And can you also elaborate on the competitive dynamics you're expecting for both TREMFYA and STELARA in psoriasis with the launch of Skyrizi? Joseph Wolk : Chris, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. So with pharmaceuticals, as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, we do expect a continued growth above the market. I think, as we would have sat here last year, we expected a bigger impact in 2019 from the loss of exclusivity and generic and biosimilar competition. To our products and to our team's credit, based on the data, the safety, the efficacy, the familiarity of the products and comfortability for physicians and patients, those products were able to retain that business a little bit longer. We would expect that to bleed into 2020. And -- but we still do, even with that, I'll call it, a neutralized headwind. It's not a tailwind per se, but I'll call it a neutralized headwind. Compared to 2019, I think we do certainly expect that the portfolio of products will continue to outperform the general market of pharmaceuticals in general. Alex Gorsky : Chris, this is Alex. Just to add one comment on to that. Look, we're extremely proud, overall, the performance of our pharmaceutical group, particularly our immunology group within pharma. If you just step back a moment and look over the past several years, at -- first of all, the way that they were able to manage the biosimilar impact with REMICADE while simultaneously launching multiple new indications for compounds like STELARA, launching TREMFYA. To note, that TREMFYA had 55% growth in the quarter, STELARA at 19% growth. And frankly, also, it's the clinical development and the competitive differentiation with TREMFYA, for example, having comparative trials, not only versus our own compounds, but also against Humira and Cosentyx. And I think what's really important is that in areas that -- where these products are used, it's not only the short-term results, but it's particularly important for the long-term results. So many patients on psoriasis will shift from product to product and are suffering from this condition for a long time and having in excess of 48 months' worth of duration and treatment effect, by a compound like TREMFYA, I think, really helps explain its uptake and continued confidence and use by physicians and patients in the marketplace. So if we combine that with the penetration rate of probably somewhere in the 30% to 40% rate in this overall category, we think that there's still a lot of unmet need. We think that there's still a lot of opportunity with these compounds. And that doesn't even include some of the additional clinical development programs that we're having in areas such as GI as well for these, where, particularly for a compound like STELARA, we're seeing great impact. We think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead. Christopher Schott : Great. Great. And I can do one other really quick one here. Other income, $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. I think that's still a bit above your historic levels of other income. I know this number can be a bit lumpy, but should we think about this type of level as a new norm or could we think about that number declining further as we look beyond 2020? Joseph Wolk : Chris, thanks for the question. I would say it's certainly down from what we experienced in 2019. And I would expect not to provide any insights into 2021 just yet, but I would expect that number to come further down as we look out. So as you see, this year, we're improving our operating margins by nearly 100 basis points to offset some of the effect that we had the benefit of in 2019, and I think we'll continue to do that. But to be truthful, we continually look and manage our portfolio in a very rigorous fashion, making sure that we're the best owners of the assets that we have, and that works both ways. So, we look to complement our portfolio, but we'll also look to take underperforming businesses and create value for shareholders in other ways. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Just one on the extra week and one on the litigation. Joe, can you talk about the impact of the extra week in 2020? In 2015, it was about 4% in Q4, 1% for the full year and neutral to EPS. Does it impact U.S. more than international? Does it impact some businesses more than others? I heard your comments on Consumer, but I'm thinking more about pharma and med tech. And I have one follow-up. Joseph Wolk : Yes. So Larry, with respect to the fiscal 53rd week, that translates to about 2 to 3 shipping days. I would say that's pretty much the norm for the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical units that you've asked about. It's a little bit less in Consumer in terms of impact because it doesn't impact stocking during the holiday season. So -- and you're absolutely correct. We have the same assumptions around EPS. It's pretty much neutral because you still have a full week of expenses without really the benefit of a full week of sales. Lawrence Biegelsen : And Alex, just one on litigation. Just what's the latest on the opioid litigation, the latest on the $4 billion settlement you had previously announced? Any important dates, milestones we should think about. And just lastly, on talc, when do you expect the decision from the Daubert hearing? Thanks for taking the questions. Joseph Wolk : Hey Larry, this is Joe. I'll take that. So thanks for the questions. With respect to the opioid settlement and agreement in principle that was announced shortly after our Q3 earnings, where we set aside $4 billion, we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state Attorney Generals to finalize the agreement in principle. We remain, I would say, cautiously optimistic that that's progressing very well. We're highly engaged to the extent we can be to finalize that agreement in principle, and we hope to hear more over the coming months from the lead negotiators representing not just the states, but as you know, the counties and municipalities. With respect to talc and the Daubert litigation, we are awaiting Judge Wilson's verdict in that. Again, as you know, that's an evidentiary standards hearing, so we'll be able to make sure that there's great clarity and certainty as to the type of scientific evidence that needs to be presented, as you know, and you probably saw in the Journal of American Medical Association, the article published just a few weeks ago, probably one of the most comprehensive reports evaluating all studies from independent sources, found no link between talc and cancer. So we think that's, again, another independent source. And we think those facts, those -- that data, that scientific research will bear out in the end. Operator : Your next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Great. Just a couple of questions this morning. Joe, just one clarification and one qualitative on revenue. So the 5% to 6% operational guidance for 2020, the way to think about that is that includes about 50 to 100 basis points of the net effect of selling days adjusted for the Consumer SKUs? Joseph Wolk : That's exactly right, David. David Lewis : Okay. And just a follow-up on revenue. And then one more quick one after that. Just qualitatively, Joe, can you sort of help us understand 2020, how you see it framing up from a Pharmaceutical, Consumer Medical Device business? And historically, you've given us a sense of sort of which businesses are likely to accelerate and which businesses are sort of more stable. So across Pharma or MD&D and Consumer, how do you see sort of the qualitative parameters driving the 2020 guide? Joseph Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. So we have, I think, great narratives across all 3 of our businesses. If you look at Pharmaceuticals, we will continue to accelerate growth. I would say we'll be above market. It's probably not as robust as we would have thought this time last year, again, because we were able to retain some of the business that was subject to generic and biosimilar competition. But again, very healthy growth above market. And we'll be looking to complement the portfolio certainly with advancing our pipeline. We've got a couple of things that are -- hopefully will be filed this year around Ponesimod for multiple sclerosis. We hope to gain approval on the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, which is a tremendous benefit for patients. And we'll see continued uptake of BALVERSA and SPRAVATO. In Medical Devices, we're very pleased. And just to put it into some context for the analyst community here, in 2017, we grew 1.6%. And in 2018, I'm sorry, we grew 2.7%, and now we're up to 3.9%, and we're not done. So we're going to continue to accelerate growth, be towards that in the middle of the market range that we believe is on the horizon for 2020. And that's before we have the opportunity to launch what we think will be a very differentiated offering around digital robotic surgery. In Consumer, again, as Alex mentioned in some of his remarks, we have focused on profitability there. We focused putting investment behind our stronghold categories of skin health and self-care. So that would be TYLENOL and MOTRIN for self-care, AVEENO and NEUTROGENA for skin health. Those brands continue to do extremely well. I would suspect we grow more in line with the market for that category, except for the SKU rationalization, where we'll be looking to deprioritize some less productive brands. David Lewis : Okay. And then Joe, just one a quick question, follow-up on margins. In some of the years, you've had sort of other income headwinds, you've been able to offset it with more significant SG&A gains driving margins. You're talking about, about 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2020. Medical Devices, but the JV agreement continues to track well. Other just spending dynamics and more visibility on sort of the 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion in 2020 headwinds and tailwinds that we should be thinking about? Joseph Wolk : Yes. I don't know. Chris, do you want to add something? Christopher DelOrefice : I just wanted to amplify on Consumer. Just examples of that, TYLENOL and NEUTROGENA for the full year this past year. NEUTROGENA at 6% growth. Tylenol, 9% growth, just to build on what you were sharing on Consumer. Joseph Wolk : Right. Okay. Thanks, Chris. With respect to margin expansion, David, I think we would look to certainly manufacturing capabilities, improving our productivity there. I would point to the consumer SKU rationalization, the design behind that is specifically to improve profitability. And then we'll continue to look at other opportunities for enabling functions across finance, HR, information technology and procurement to get savings. So we think we're in pretty good shape to deliver that for 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Just one clarification. The extra week with the SKU rationalization, it's a net impact overall. It's 50 to 100 to the top line. Is that correct? Joseph Wolk : That's correct, Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Perfect. Just want to clarify that. And then just a big-picture, I guess, question, just portfolio and capital allocation. I know you had mentioned just in terms of models need to take into consideration with the share count, no further share repurchase activity. You guys are in a pretty good position, obviously, from a share -- sorry, cash flow perspective, generating $20 billion this year. It sounds like your expectation is to pay out the opioid settlement. But I guess, why not get more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective? Just how should we think about capital allocation going forward? Alex Gorsky : Kristen, this is Alex. Thank you very much for the question. And look, we're really proud of our strong performance across our businesses. And frankly, as it relates to our capital allocation model this year, and we're very confident in it going forward. As we mentioned in the results earlier, if you think about the free cash flow spin-off that we had in 2019, I think it is indicative of not only great discipline across our various lines. And you see the P&L in front of you. So overall, it was quite healthy. But it's also important to note that we did that in the context of also continuing to invest in more than 11 acquisitions, about 6 licensing agreements, where we invested almost $7.5 billion just in the course of the year. So as we talked about in the past, we'll continue to invest in our brands and in research and development at an appropriate rate. If you go back over the last 4 years, I think if you add the numbers up in R&D, we've invested more than $45 billion during that time frame. And we think that based upon the number of new product launches in our Pharma, Medical Device business and our Consumer business, that we've gotten a good return on that. We continue to keep a healthy dividend, at the same time, we realize how important that is. During that same time frame, 4 years, it's a pretty similar number to our R&D. It's about $40 billion to $45 billion. And of course, after that, we always take a look at value-creating acquisitions. And again, during that same time frame, I think the number comes to about $50 billion that we've invested. Over the past year of note was -- you might say the additional investment that we made in Auris, and we think combining that with the later buyout that we did with the Verb -- with Verb and Verily is the right thing. If you think ahead in Medical Devices, there are probably a few things that are going to represent a more secular shift in that domain, then the shift into digital and robotic surgery. And bringing those together, we think, creates a very exciting opportunity for us. But we also continue to do value-creating tuck-in opportunities as well as our Pharmaceutical business. As we just talked about at the end of the year, we brought in 2 really exciting compounds, bermekimab in particular, in both AS as well as other conditions, we think, represents a great opportunity. And it's certainly an area where we've got a lot of capability and a lot of expertise. And finally, we talk about share repurchases. And I think we've demonstrated over the last 4 or 5 years that we'll certainly employ share repurchases when we think that we're undervalued, particularly in a significant way. And again, I think an outcome of the way that we manage our overall P&L, it means that we can do these things simultaneously. It's not necessarily in order, and we continue to -- we expect to continue that strategy going forward. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Kristen, just a quick comment out, and thanks for noticing the comments around share count. I have to tip my hat and complement the investment community because when we go through the consensus P&L, the income in terms of absolute dollars was almost spot on. It was eerily close, in fact. And then where the disconnect came in the form of share count, where the average share count used in consensus was about 14 million shares less, which translates to about $0.05 or $0.06. So we thought we were very much in line with what consensus' expectations were. And while we don't provide guidance assuming any share repurchase that's not currently authorized, it seems that a few analysts may have made that assumption. Operator : Next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Joshua Jennings : First is on robotics, and you clearly have put a stake in the ground in with investments. You're pursuing leadership in digital surgery ecosystem. I just wanted to see if I understand we're going to get a big update at the Med Device Day in May. But if you could wet our appetite at all today, just give any updates on progress of the Auris launch, a time line for Orthotaxy? And then any indications that you see where robotics is not in play today that could come into play over the next 3 to 5 years in your portfolio? And then second question is, just for Joe and Alex, I guess, is just on the other income line has been a focus. I think the concerns are where that could fall up next year within the out years. And when you talk about your process for a portfolio review and then pruning maybe underperforming assets or assets that don't fit under your roof. If you could just talk about that process and how regiment it is? Is there a formula? Is there 1% of the portfolio that gets pruned every year? Or is it just a strategic and opportunistic annually? I apologize for the background noise. Alex Gorsky : Josh, thank you very much for the question. Look, I'm really glad that you mentioned robotics and digital in terms of an entire platform for us because, of course, that's exactly what it is. And let's start first with our acquisition of Auris Health. And overall, what we would say, it's off to a great start, where we couldn't be more thrilled to have the robotics pioneer and former CEO, Fred Moll and his team at J&J. The Monarch platform is off to a very good start. It's going to play a critical role in our lung cancer initiative. And when you just look at the science and the technology and what it can do with the distal parts of the lung, what it brings in terms of potentially ablation, leveraging it with our NeuWave technology, and even longer term, having the potential to dispense oncolytic viruses in treating cancer in very new and unique ways is exciting. Physicians have performed more than 2,000 bronchoscopy procedures with them on our platform. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing with it. Second, you saw our announcement on Verb. And we think combining Auris and Verb really helps ensure that we have a very strong role in the next-generation of the digital surgery platform and ongoing development. Our teams are working now together in a really comprehensive way. We do look -- sorry for that feedback. But we do look at this as a platform that is something that will be in place for the next several decades. Therefore, it's really important that we step through this in the right way. And what I would say is the early results from the collaboration and the partnership that we're seeing between these teams is very encouraging. And that's why we're excited to give you this preview that Joe mentioned on May 13 in New York because we think it will provide a very clear, transparent kind of tangible evidence of not only the machines, but also the digital platform component of this as well. Next, we're really excited about the progress that's being made with VELYS in our Orthopaedics robotics platform as well. It's an exciting technology. We think that it's going to offer a portable, low-cost system that's easy to use, will improve accuracy. It also is a nice combination to ensure the surgeon remains intimately involved. And if we look at the training and technical support, it's something that will be easily coordinated between ORs and surgeons. So we're progressing towards a mid-year 2020 regulatory submission for this. So really, if you just step back and you think about what we have going with Auris and Monarch, if you think about the plans now that we have in placed with VELYS in Orthopaedics, longer term, as we bring out that next generation of digital and robotics platform more broadly across surgery, we're very excited about it. Joseph Wolk : And Josh, to address your question regarding the management of our portfolio, so I would say it's rigorous. It's not formulaic, though. So we meet as a management team and executive committee monthly on what additions or deletions from our portfolio makes sense. And makes sense probably should be defined in terms of we have aspirations in all the markets we play in to be either number one or number two in that space with the promise of bringing better solutions in that space to patients and consumers across the globe. We have plans in place for all of our businesses to do that. But after a period of time where those plans don't come to fruition, we'll assess other alternatives. I would say, under Alex's leadership, we've gotten very disciplined in this rigor, and that's proved to be pretty productive, I think, in terms of how we've been able to take underperforming businesses, turn that into gains and reinvest back in businesses and areas that we think we've got a differentiated right to win. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : So I just had 1 follow-up on one of your business lines in the Med Devices. Then in Orthopaedics, clearly, it looks like you were able to deliver a pretty solid improvement in knees, in the U.S. And I just was wondering if you'd be willing to offer any color on the spine growth within the sort of spine and other category, like which parts of that were the drivers of the decline. And then I had 1 follow-up, if I could, for Alex on digital health. Joseph Wolk : So thanks for the question, Matt. Good to speak with you. So we are very proud of the knees performance. If you look, that was a declining business in 2018. We've had almost a 2-point improvement there. So the team has done a very nice job. We have ATTUNE both the primary as well as the Revision platform available for patients. We've also made an entry into the cementless side of the business, which, as you know, is the fastest-growing piece of that business. And as Alex mentioned, we look forward to what VELYS could do on the horizon. With respect to spine, I think you have to take into account the impact of a 2018 U.S. rebate adjustment, which impacted comparative growth about 250 basis points. If you look at the growth, on the U.S., it was probably about half of the decline of what you saw based on that comparison. We continue to see pretty good growth outside the U.S., specifically in Asia Pacific. I don't know, Chris, if there's any other commentary in spine out there. Christopher DelOrefice : Yes, Matt, I would just say, if you adjust for that, I would say the business has stabilized at low single-digit declines. Where we're seeing success is where we have new innovation, in particular, in degenerative spine with our 3D cage and our VIPER PRIME Systems. I think the next level of improvements will come from SYMPHONY system in posterior cervical, which was launched later this year. So we really didn't get that benefit in this year at all, and we'll expect to see that continued improvement through next year and beyond. Matthew Miksic : That's great. And then just a follow-up. I appreciate the update and overview on the robotic surgery strategy, Alex. But I guess, one of the things that we've noticed is just how quickly -- and I realize it's sort of a buzz-worthy term, and we see it in a lot of magazines, but artificial intelligence in digital health. For whatever reason, implementation and innovation, but it seems to be moving perhaps the fastest of the categories of digital surgery and digital health. And just wondering, one of your competitors is partnered with a smaller innovator in that space around stroke. I'm sure you're watching it. I'm sure you're making investments and looking at it. I'm just curious if you could give us an update or a preview perhaps of what you'll talk about in the spring. Alex Gorsky : Sure. Thanks again for the question, Matt. Look, I -- there are few areas across our different innovation or technology platforms that are not being touched by some of this new technology, whether it's AI, whether it's ML, whether it's digital, whether it's the cloud. I mean if you think about just our Pharmaceutical portfolio, for example, and you've talked to Paul Stoffels or Mathai Mammen or Bill Hait, I think what they would tell you is one of the most important areas supporting that is our data sciences' capabilities. And the insights that we can gain from reviewing these large data sets and coming and developing much better insights, frankly, is helping lead us to a much faster and more productive identification of new targets. And it certainly is helping us when we apply those same skills and capabilities of the clinical development programs as you work with hospitals and large medical systems, and you can review medical health records, for example, in a much more detailed way in terms of patient selection and tracking through development. So we're certainly excited about it there. As it relates to Medical Devices, we've been, I think, very consistent in sharing our thinking that, again, this next generation is certainly about the robotics component that helps facilitate perhaps having more consistency in an exact procedure, perhaps getting into a tighter space, having better access. But we think, longer term, the digital AI component of that in terms of helping preoperatively and developing a very detailed plan, even being applied intraoperatively, in terms of additional guidance systems. And by the way, then that can -- not only to help a surgeon get to a particular area, but it could also be to help him or her stay away from areas that may and could cause a problem. And then, of course, how that information can be utilized by large health care systems to really ensure that they've got the most effective and efficient and value-added health care delivery programs in place, we think, will be more important than ever. So hence, our reason for partnering with Verb and Verily and Alphabet, in building those capabilities. And again, it's something that more broadly across Johnson & Johnson, we're spending a lot of time thinking about how all those capabilities are going to become more and more part of our doing business, of our doing research and development across each one of our sectors. Operator : Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Just wanted to talk a little bit more about Medical Devices. Specifically, you guys saw a pretty strong sales growth acceleration on an operational adjusted basis this year. How do we think about the next year? I know Ashley have said, in the past, it's not linear quarterly, but I suspect we should be looking for another uptick. Can you help talk about that what specifically will be the drivers in 2020 of that? Alex Gorsky : Sure, Danielle. Thank you very much for the question. Look, we're -- again, we're really proud of the progress that Ashley and her team has made over the last several years. Joe took you through the improvement from 2017 to '18 to 2019. And we certainly expect that trajectory to continue in the coming years. If I just got to 0 down for a moment, though, on 2019, we saw first half growth of about 3.8%, and we saw growth in the second half at 4%. And while there's a little bit of lumpiness in the quarters, and consistent with Ashley's comments -- and look, we're still taking a look at Q4, we think that the timing of the holidays and a few other things, I think you always have to be careful what you attribute. But if you just look at the number of days between some of those, we think that, that could potentially have had an impact. But it really doesn't change the overall trend of accelerated growth in second half versus first half. Now if we look at our business, it's really being driven by a number of factors. In our surgery business, what you're seeing is strong performance in areas like electrophysiology, another 14% growth in this quarter with great new technology. We expect a continuous launch in the coming year as well with new products. You also saw good performance in our energy business at just about 3% growth, and biosurgery coming in at about 4% growth. We think one of the growth drivers, frankly, is just overcoming our supply issue in 2020. That probably cut our biosurgery growth rate in half, especially in the latter part of the year. So we think once we work our way through that, that's going to be a growth driver for us. Our CIRCULAR Stapler launch is also going well. We're going to lap the recall as well that we had in the past year. So we think those are definitely drivers in our core surgery business. If we look at Orthopaedics, here, too, we've seen this steady cadence of improvement. Our knee business, ATTUNE, the launch of the Cementless, the Revision is going very well. And if you think about it, we've turned that from being down almost 0.5% to 1% to growing at 1.4% in this quarter, which, again, shows physicians' increasing confidence in that platform. And we're starting to see an uptake again in ATTUNE primaries, and so we're really pleased to see that. And then, of course, our hip performance coming in at over 4%. Strong trauma at about 2% -- 2.5%, we think is pretty consistent with the market. Chris addressed some of the issues in spine and how we see that moving forward. And then, of course, there's Vision Care. And I think what we see in Vision Care is fundamentally strong performance in contact lenses. You saw about 3% growth overall in our contact lens business, but what's important to note there is we had 9% growth in the United States. So the transition lens, the astig lens, daily disposables continue to go well. Frankly, we've been disappointed in some of our surgical performance, particularly in the U.S. We've got plans in place to address that. If you look at the ongoing rollout that we're going to have with the TECNIS and the SYMPHONY and the Synergy, we're very optimistic that it's going to make us more competitive, not only in the astig area, but really across that entire platform. So we're confident that that's going to lead to continued growth trends as we go through 2020 and certainly setting ourselves up for even continued growth beyond that as well. Operator : Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Maybe just two for me. You guys presented additional data at ASH from your BCMA CAR-T program in myeloma and recently got breakthrough designation or planning to file for approval later this year. Would love your initial thoughts on overcoming some of the hurdles faced by other CAR-T drugs and longer term where you see this drug playing a role in the treatment paradigm. The second question relates to the FDA announcement of a meeting next month on testing methods for asbestos and talc. I was just wondering if the company is participating. And then what do you think the key issues that are going to be discussed there? Alex Gorsky : Sure, Terence. Thank you very much. Let me take the first one regarding the CAR-T data at ASH. As I'm sure you saw when we released the data, we were very excited when we saw those results. And again, here, too, I think it's maybe important to just step back and think about the steps that our team has taken over the last several years regarding CAR-T therapy. And when you look at the different development programs that are out there, how we were able to support or source this from Legend, the way that we were able to accelerate the development time lines, the ongoing and great work that our supply chain is doing as well to ensure that we've got the strong integrity of that supply chain, the dependability that's put in place, we're really proud of the progress they made. And I think the results that we shared at ASH demonstrate our increasing confidence. And by the way, we think this is great news for patients, particularly those who have failed multiple other treatment lines in a very difficult-to-treat condition like multiple myeloma. And as we think about it going forward, look, we think that this is truly an opportunity to transform the way patients are treated in this space. We've got a lot of confidence in our reimbursement teams. I think we demonstrated in other areas that we can work with payers in a very collaborative way. We're also innovative not only in the products that we're bringing, but frankly, in the reimbursement programs that we introduced as well. And we intend to work just that way with payers and providers both in the United States, but also abroad, ultimately to make sure that this therapy is available for patients that they can get access to it. And that it's not only as effective as the data that you -- that we saw at ASH, but it's also cost-effective to the overall health care system. Christopher DelOrefice : Joe, do you want to... Joseph Wolk : Sure. And Terence, with respect to the meeting, I believe it's next month, February 4, regarding testing methods around talc. We certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product, specifically. We will not be active participants at that meeting. However, I can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current FDA standards for cosmetic talc. Operator : That last question will be coming from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : So my first question for you is, what your view on M&A is this year? And what areas you're most interested in? Is it pharma, consumer or devices or all of the above? And then my second question is how optimistic are you regarding a universal settlement for opioids. Alex Gorsky : Okay. Let me take the first part of that, Louise. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, I think we demonstrated in 2019, as I mentioned earlier, that we remained active really across all 3 areas. I think we did 11 acquisitions, 6 licensing agreements and putting more than $7 billion worth of capital to work. We have continued, I think, our pattern of tuck-in acquisitions where we get new technologies, as you saw that we did with both XBiotech and other opportunities in our Pharmaceutical business. We would expect to continue that. We also did -- had a fair amount of activity in our Medical Device group, led by Auris that we did earlier in the year. And then in our Consumer group, of course, that was led by Dr. Ci Labo, which also gave us a great toehold that you might say, into the premium beauty segment, particularly in Asia, but with plans to expand that into the United States. So we'll be looking across all three of our segments, but we would expect there to be an ongoing cadence of M&A activity in those different areas. Joseph Wolk : And Louise, with respect to the opioid settlement. So we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state attorney generals to finalize the agreement in principle. I would say we remain optimistic and confident that the agreement is moving forward, but certainly can't predict when that agreement in principle will be finalized. So we'll continue to monitor that, engage as needed and hopefully come to a resolution. Christopher DelOrefice : Thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex just for some closing comments. Alex Gorsky : Well, thank you, everybody, for your ongoing support across 2019. As we mentioned earlier, we're very proud of our strong performance. But we're even more excited and more confident about what the prospects hold for 2020 and beyond. I think we had a chance to review a lot of the opportunities that lie in front of us, and we look forward to continuing to keep you updated throughout the year as we progress through our plan. So thank you very much, everybody, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company\u2019s review of business results for the first quarter of 2020. I hope everyone is healthy and remaining safe during these times. With safety in mind, we are utilizing a more virtual approach in exercising social distancing while conducting this call. Joining me on call today to address Johnson & Johnson\u2019s response to the coronavirus global pandemic along with our first quarter results are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee, will also join Alex, Paul, Joe and myself. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com where you can also find additional materials, including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules. We would like to draw your attention to the fact that there are slight changes to the sales reporting of the medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses which I will comment to as I review the segment commentary. Additionally, those changes are noted and reconciliations are available on the website. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. In order for us to provide insights related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to allow for ample time for Q&A, the call will last around 90 minutes. Please note that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today\u2019s presentation, which identifies certain factors that may cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at anytime and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company\u2019s business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today\u2019s date. Our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today\u2019s discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today\u2019s agenda, Alex will start with his perspectives related to the COVID-19 pandemic and JNJ\u2019s response. Paul will then update you on our efforts to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus along with JNJ\u2019s therapeutic development efforts. Next, I will cover consolidated and segment sales information along with some operational highlights from the P&L with the estimated COVID-19 impact framed where applicable. Joe will conclude by providing insights on the status of our operations, including actions we are taking to maintain business continuity, how we think about our capital allocation during this time and will provide an update on our full year guidance. The remaining time will be available for your questions. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Chris and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels for joining our first quarter webcast. As the Vice Chairs of Johnson & Johnson and given the leadership role they are playing as we mobilize our efforts and resources across the company to address COVID-19, I thought it would be helpful to have both of them available to answer potential questions and convey key information. Paul will also share more detailed perspective in his prepared commentary which will follow my remarks. Clearly, COVID-19 is at the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind, which is why we plan to spend a fair amount of time during the earnings webcast discussing this unprecedented global pandemic, the profound impact it is having on global public health, and our unwavering commitment to create and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Johnson & Johnson was built for times like this and our strong first quarter results are just one reflection of our sustainable business model. Our Johnson & Johnson colleagues remain focused on delivering on the commitments and responsibilities to our patients, doctors, nurses, employees, parents, children, communities and shareholders as defined in our Credo. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $1.01 which is another reflection of our stability and further underscores our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. This marks the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases for Johnson & Johnson and we believe that taking this action is the right thing to do for our shareholders at this time and importantly a strong example of the confidence we have in our business now and in the future. Given Chris and Joe will discuss our first quarter performance and outlook in greater detail, I would like to take just a few minutes to highlight four pillars of strength that reinforce why Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. These pillars serve as the foundation of our resiliency and response to the current COVID-19 crisis and provide the dynamic foundation for Johnson & Johnson to continue to build a stronger, healthier and successful future for all of our stakeholders. And we recognize the challenges that individuals, companies and the world are facing right now. As we look forward, we are confident that together we will win this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and we are maintaining a long-term view of optimism. The first pillar is our longstanding belief in driving both performance and purpose with equal commitment. Across Johnson & Johnson, we operate with the belief there is a tightly linked connection between our company\u2019s purpose, which is to advance health for humanity and our financial performance which has helped us deliver lifesaving medicines and lifesaving products as well as invest and support communities around the world. We recognize the challenges that families and their loved ones are facing in these volatile and unpredictable times and this is exactly why across our enterprise we have been working so hard our help those in need and to accelerate our collective efforts towards ending this pandemic. Some examples of note include, we are applying all of our capabilities to support nurses, doctors, midwives and community health workers. Recently, it was announced that Johnson & Johnson family of companies and the Johnson & Johnson Foundation are increasing our previous $250 million commitment over 10 years by an additional $50 million for immediate COVID-19 response. This contribution will primarily focus on supporting frontline health workers who are truly modern day heroes and the backbone of the healthcare system. We are also working diligently to convert manufacturing lines of several facilities around the world for products most in need during the pandemic so we can continue to provide important medicines and products to patients. The second pillar I want to highlight is of strategic advantage of being the most broadly based healthcare company in the industry. Leading across the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices segments provides us with the unique and powerful perspective that enables us to see more, reach more, learn more and do more across the full spectrum of health as well as throughout every age and stage of our patients and consumers\u2019 lives. In fact, in our pharmaceutical business, we are thrilled to have identified a lead candidate for a potential vaccine. In consumer, Tylenol is one of our most iconic and trusted brands by consumers and healthcare professional for reducing fever and we have increased production running our Tylenol manufacturing plant 24/7 to maximize supply. We have also refocused our manufacturing lines to make our easiest-to-produce pills, which are the white Tylenol caplets, so we can increase production and throughput. In Medical Devices, we are experiencing a near term negative impact and expect this to continue while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address patients impacted by this pandemic. That said, Medical Devices has historically been a strong market and we believe the underlying fundamentals of the market remain intact. We continue to see tremendous potential over the long-term to serve our patients and customers. And at this time, and in this time of need, we are utilizing our supply chain delivery in 3D printing expertise in collaboration with Prisma Health to manufacture and distribute the VESper ventilator expansion splitter device, which addresses the acute ventilator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and at no cost to healthcare providers. Additionally, we continue to support and share product availability to healthcare workers, hospital systems and surgeons in critical need areas such as trauma, stroke and other life saving surgeries that cannot be deferred. The third pillar is our unparalleled scientific expertise. Innovation is integral to our ability to deliver breakthrough healthcare solutions and the remarkable and ambitious work that we have underway to eradicate COVID-19 is a true testament to this fact. Based on 134 years of experience, we know that the power of our science, the scale of our business and the dedication of our employees is critical in driving innovative solutions that can change people\u2019s lives for the better and change the face of healthcare. In collaboration with scientists from various external institutions, we have been able to identify a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We will leverage the scientific expertise of our internal teams with a decade of work spend developing vaccines for HIV, Zika and Ebola to apply the groundbreaking science and scalable manufacturing platform that we already have in place. This is monumental and is much needed. We are accelerating timelines and plan to begin production at risk imminently. And we are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The fourth and last pillar is the world-class talent, capabilities and dedication of our 132,000 colleagues worldwide. We always take actions and employee tactics to support our Johnson & Johnson colleagues, both professionally and personally, to ensure they are safe and well equipped and today is no different. We are ensuring employees are able to play their part in helping to fight the COVID-19 outbreak at home and at work. Some examples include we\u2019ve implemented significantly enhanced sanitizing procedures and appropriate distancing to ensure we maintain safe, clean and well functioning facilities across our manufacturing, distribution centers and research and development sites. We are rolling out a one-time award of $1000 per essential employee with cost of living adjustments globally whose presence is required on site to recognize the extraordinary work these employees are doing to advance our science and ensure supply of our most essential products and medicines. We are providing 100% of base salary and benefits through April 30 to employees who are primary caregivers and are unable to work remotely due to COVID-related family care responsibilities, underlying health issues, connectivity issues or other unique circumstances. And we are granting up to 14 weeks of paid leave to employees around the world with medical training who volunteer or who are called to serve the communities in diagnosing, treating and providing health support related to COVID-19. And underpinning each of these four pillars is our Credo. Our Credo has been a source of both inspiration and confidence for me and my Johnson & Johnson colleagues, especially in times like these. For more than 75 years, our Credo has been the moral compass that guides our business decisions and it\u2019s the blueprint that outlines how we operate and care for the world. Guided by our Credo and unyielding sense of purpose, we have created a powerful legacy of improving the health and well-being of people worldwide, while delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders. We have a century plus history of leading in times of great challenge. We have done it before and we can do it again. This is what the world expects of us and this is what we are all committed to, and prepared to do. Now as the world continues to face the significant and urgent public health crisis, I want to emphasize that across Johnson & Johnson, we are leveraging our broad base, size and scale to think, lead and operate with the same level of incredible urgency relying on the same courage, conviction and core strengths that set us apart and empower us to make a positive impact on society and healthcare. I am both proud and amazed at the level of dedication that I\u2019ve witnessed from every Johnson & Johnson business, function, team and person over the last several weeks. Now, we certainly don\u2019t have all the answers today. We\u2019ll find the ones needed to ensure our success for tomorrow and we won\u2019t take shortcuts to compromise our standards or values as we move with speed and determination. As I said earlier, Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. We take a long-term strategic view, which means we\u2019re in this for the long haul delivering value to all of our stakeholders. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I\u2019ll now turn it over to Paul, who will provide an update on the progress we\u2019re making with the COVID-19 vaccine development. Thank you. Paul? Paul Stoffels : Thank you, Alex. I\u2019m pleased to provide an update on a multi-pronged approach to addressing COVID-19 including developing a vaccine and screening of compound libraries to identify potential new treatments to address this pandemic. In addition, we are exploring immunomodulators to protect against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS in COVID-19. While we focus today on finding potential new treatments, ultimately a vaccine is key to eradicating the ongoing threat of the pandemic. Since 2011, Johnson & Johnson has invested heavily to build state-of-the-art vaccine capabilities which we used to develop and manufacture our Ebola, Zika, RSV and HIV vaccine candidates. We are bringing to bear those same capabilities to rapidly accelerate our efforts towards the potential COVID-19 vaccine. We are pleased to see that there are many approaches to vaccines for COVID-19 which show the importance of ongoing research in industry over the past several decades. Our COVID-19 vaccine program leverages Janssen Adeno vector and PER. C6 technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. Based on the WHO criteria for key attributes for prioritizing vaccine platforms, here on the right, the attributes of our platform put us in a leadership position. First, our Adeno26 viral vector platform induces potent and long lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in humans. Further this approach has very low to no risk on the respiratory disease enhancement based on the immune responses observed across our programs. This is in line with the observation that targeted preclinical models used in context of the RSV vaccine development have shown that this platform is not associated with enhanced respiratory disease. Our platform has a proven safety profile. More than 50,000 people have been vaccinated and we have demonstrated that it\u2019s well tolerated. Our PER.C6 cell line offers a high yielding vaccine manufacturing platform and is scalable and fully industrialized providing us the ability to make hundreds of millions of vaccines per year. Capacity in our Leiden-based vaccines launch facility is as high as 300 million doses per year. Finally, we have 2 to 8 Celsius stability data on our vaccine making it compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and therefore will not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it. We began working on a vaccine candidate in early January as soon as the coronavirus sequence became first available. As you can see in the infographic on the right, to make vaccine candidates, we insert a piece of the spike protein into the genome of a non-replicating and therefore non-infective adenovirus, a type of common cold virus. The research teams at Janssen in collaboration with BIDMC at Harvard Medical School constructed and tested multiple vaccine candidates. The vaccine constructs were tested then to identify those with most promise in producing an immune response in pre-clinical testing. Based on this work, Johnson & Johnson announced for March 30 that we have identified the lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate along with two backups. In order for any vaccine to be manufacture to GMP in large quantities, it is necessary to first produce a Master Seed bank which is den for genitive of all future large scale vaccination batches. All three candidates are now entering pre-Master Seed production. Final selection of start of Master Seed production is expected in June 2020. As we have already announced, we are expanding our global manufacturing capacity in parallel, including the establishment of a new U.S. vaccine manufacturing capability. We are also in discussions with other potential partners to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe and Asia and look forward to making those announcements in the coming weeks. We plan to begin production at risk imminently and our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally. We are on track to start Phase 1 clinical trials in early September in the U.S. and Europe with clinical data on safety and immunogenicity expected to be available by the end of the year. This could allow vaccine availability for emergency use authorization as early as early 2021. We are confident in this vaccine candidate because we have now seen good data in animal models. While we are moving with extreme speeds, we are absolutely committed to making sure that our vaccine follows all guidelines with regard to good manufacturing practices and quality controls. We are not cutting any corners when it comes to safety. We are able to achieve the speed because we are doing several processes in parallel many at risk rather than in sequence. In addition to our work on vaccines we are screening compound libraries, including compounds from Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies to identify potential treatments against COVID-19 and exploring immunomodulators to protect against ARDS. The antiviral screening efforts are being conducted in partnership with the Rega Institute at the University of Leuven in Belgium. As I mentioned, we have been able to reach this point as a result of multiple collaborations. As you also saw in the March 30 announcement as part of our new partnership with BARDA, we have together committed more than $1 billion of investment to co-fund vaccine research, development, clinical testing and accelerated manufacturing. If a vaccine is approved, we will work with relevant healthcare authorities to ensure that our products are accessible wherever needed. We are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health challenges we have seen in our lifetimes, but at the same time, we have unprecedented science and technology available today to help us mount a false and effective response. Johnson & Johnson is committed to harnessing the latest tools sharing knowledge and resources and fueling global collaborations to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now, I will turn it over to Chris to discuss our results for the quarter. Thank you. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Paul. Now, I will provide our Q1 results. Worldwide sales were $20.7 billion for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 3.3% versus the first quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 4.8% as currency had a negative impact of 1.5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 5.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1%. However, operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4%, with currency negatively impacting our reported o-U.S. results by 3 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.6% worldwide, 6.7% in the U.S., and 4.5% outside the U.S. These global sales results include an estimated net impact of COVID-19 which negatively impacted worldwide sales by about 80 basis points. This includes a negative impact to our medical device business segment across all regions with Asia-Pacific and the U.S. regions seeing the most prominent impact. Partially offsetting this was a net positive sales lift in our consumer health and pharmaceutical business segments as communities prepare to ensure they have the necessary access to healthcare products and medicines. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter net earnings were $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share, was $2.17 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.39 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.30, representing increases of 8.7% and 9.5% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.5%. Beginning with consumer health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the first quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Additionally, I will be providing additional insights using our best estimates on the contribution of COVID-19 to our performance in the areas where this had the largest impact. Worldwide consumer health sales totaled $3.6 billion growing 11.3% with operational growth in the U.S. of 21% and growth outside the U.S. of 3.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 11%. Our consumer health segment realized a net positive impact of nearly 700 basis points associated with consumers ensuring they have access to products during the COVID-19 pandemic. We do expect some of this benefit to reverse over the subsequent quarters this year. This benefit was mostly realized in our over-the-counter medicines franchise. The benefit was also most prominent in the U.S. with a small benefit outside the U.S. primarily in Europe offset by declines in Asia-Pacific in mostly the skin health beauty and baby franchises. Excluding some one-time items and the net benefit of COVID-19, our consumer health segment delivered solid performance with continued strong performance in the U.S. in priority areas within our OTC and skin health beauty franchises. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 26% operationally with about 36% growth in the U.S. and 17% outside the U.S. COVID-19 contributed about 17 points to the global growth. In the U.S., we estimated COVID-19 contributed about 24 points to growth and excluding that impact, our growth was strong enabled by share increases multiple products such as Adult Tylenol, PEPCID, ZYRTEC and Zarbee\u2019s. U.S. performance was also aided by a stronger allergy season. Additionally, there were some favorable one-time benefits resulting from competitive dynamics. COVID-19 contributed about 10 points to growth outside the U.S. Excluding that, growth was strong driven by an elevated cough and cold season in key markets like Russia. The skin health beauty franchise grew 3.5% or just under 2% when adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures driven primarily by the acquisition of Dr. Ci:Labo. This franchise experienced a net negative impact due to COVID-19 by slightly over 100 basis points with the largest negative impact in Asia-Pacific, especially in China partially offset by a favorable benefit in the U.S., the U.S. operational growth of just over 12%, benefited by about 450 basis points from COVID-19. Additionally, our core business in the U.S. remains competitive with strong performance in NEUTROGENA Facial Care. The U.S. also benefited from some timing of promotional orders. And in our remaining consumer health franchises, our oral care, women\u2019s health and wound care other franchises all reported strong growth primarily driven by COVID-19 and excluding the favorable impact of COVID-19. Each of these franchises delivered solid performance. Baby Care declined 4.9% globally or negative 2.7% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. The majority of this decline was primarily due to the execution of SKU rationalization actions primarily in EMEA and a smaller net negative COVID-19 impact partially offset by solid growth in Aveeno Baby globally. Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $11.1 billion grew 10.1% enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 8.6% and increased outside the U.S. by 12%. Global growth was aided by over 200 basis points of one-time items including about 100 basis points of impact from favorable prior period pricing adjustments in the U.S. with REMICADE being the largest product impacted and about 100 basis points of net favorable estimated impact from COVID-19 resulting from healthcare providers and wholesalers ensuring there is access to essential medicines. This benefit occurred across our portfolio with favorable benefits in the U.S. and Europe offsetting downside in the Asia-Pacific region in mostly China. Incremental COVID-19 demand primarily impacted IMBRUVICA, XARELTO, STELARA, the pulmonary hypertension portfolio and HIV products. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to continue to deliver global growth at above market levels. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of almost 22%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing over 51% globally. The U.S. grew almost 32%, with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline medications for multiple myeloma. The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains. IMBRUVICA grew over 34% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. In the U.S., based on fourth quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained almost 8 points of market share in CLL line 1 therapy. We continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA. As part of the sales reporting changes I mentioned earlier, we are now disclosing ERLEADA sales separately which were $143 million globally and more than doubled versus last year driven by continued share growth in the U.S. and continued launch progress in EMEA with availability in 18 countries. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered double-digit global sales growth of 13.1% driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. STELARA growth of over 30% was primarily driven by the Crohn\u2019s disease indication, where market share increased by over 7 points in the U.S. versus the first quarter of 2019. TREMFYA grew over 37% and achieved a 9% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2.5 points from the first quarter of 2019. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing almost 13%, with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO where the unmet need remains high. Patient demand continues to build with new patient starts steadily increasing with over 5,000 patients treated to-date. In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 11%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 13.1% primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO also declined by 2.7% with volume increases offset by increased rebates including channel mix dynamics. In our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio, sales increased 14.7% driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of about 29% and 27% respectively driven by increased market penetration and share growth. This portfolio growth was net of declining sales in TRACLEER as a result of continued generic competition. Note, as part of the sales reporting changes I referenced, TRACLEER is now included under other pulmonary hypertension. I will now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $5.9 billion declining by 6.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales declined by 4.8% worldwide. Our global medical device portfolio realized a significant impact on sales estimated to be worth 750 to 800 basis points as a result of procedures being deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic which were partially offset by stocking primarily in Asia-Pacific in anticipation of procedures ramping back up. Approximately, 50% of the net impact occurred in Asia-Pacific, about 30% was in the U.S. and the remaining balance was primarily in Europe. I will provide further context shortly about how this impacted each platform. Additionally, one-time items negatively impacted growth this quarter by about 90 basis points primarily related to there being fewer selling days in this period. Adjusting for these one-time impacts and the estimated impact of COVID-19, our adjusted operational sales growth reflects continued strong underlying fundamentals consistent with our full year 2019 adjusted results. Interventional solutions grew 0.4% globally with U.S. growth of 6.6%, offset by declining sales outside the U.S. of 5.1%. COVID-19 had a net negative impact to our global growth rate by about an estimated 14.5 points reducing U.S. growth by over 8 points and o-U.S. growth by about 20 points. Growth, excluding the impact of COVID-19, was led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Vision declined by 4.5%. The estimated net impact of COVID-19 to growth is around 550 basis points. Additionally, results in the quarter were negatively impacted by both the final bleed-down of the Japan consumption tax forward-buy that occurred in Q3 2019, along with an unfavorable prior year comparison due to an inventory forward-buy related to Brexit uncertainty, which were worth over 200 basis points in total. While contact lenses realized a slight decline, when you adjust for the aforementioned items, the business delivered another quarter of competitive growth globally versus the market led by continued strong performance of daily disposables in the ACUVUE OASYS family. In surgical vision, sales declined 15.9% with the primary driver of the decline driven by COVID-19 which impacted results by an estimated 12 points. The business excluding COVID-19 saw continued strong o-U.S. growth in the cataract business due to strong performance in Asia-Pacific, which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S., primarily due to competitive pressures. Orthopedics declined by 6.5% in the quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted growth in this franchise by about an estimated 750 basis points with the U.S. market realizing the largest dollar impact at just over 40% of the total and the balance of the negative impact split relatively evenly between Asia-Pacific and Europe. Total orthopedics growth, adjusting for this impact, was relatively consistent with our prior quarter performance, reflecting the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance. Hips declined by 5.6%. We estimated COVID-19 negatively impacted growth by about 9.5 points. Excluding this impact, hips continue to deliver competitive performance driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach, continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS and enabling technologies such as the KINCISE surgical automated system and the VELYS Hip Navigation System that came from the Joint Point acquisition. These declined by 6.1% adjusting for the estimated COVID-19 impact of about 11 points, meaning its underlying fundamentals continue to improve and delivered solid performance in both the U.S. and o-U.S. driven by new innovations such as ATTUNE Revision, ATTUNE S+ and the ATTUNE Cementless rotating platform which launched later in 2019. Trauma declined by 3.5%. COVID-19 negatively impacted results by an estimated 400 basis points. Additionally, performance was impacted by overall market softness as a result of a mild winter season, leading to lower procedures, as well as competitive pressures. Spine declined 10.6%. However, adjusting for COVID-19\u2019s estimated impact of over 750 basis points, spine\u2019s underlying performance remain consistent with recent results. While we lost share in the quarter, we continue to see positive uptake of newer products such as Conduit and VIPER PRIME. We are also pleased with the rollout of our newly launched SYMPHONY surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures. Pricing pressure continued in orthopedics. U.S. pure price in spine, hips and knees eroded versus Q4 2019 declining about 5%, 2% and 1% respectively. Price in trauma improved compared to Q4 and was essentially flat. Moving to the results for the surgery business. As I noted earlier, we made some minor adjustments to how we report our Medical Devices sales and you will see that we moved the platforms previously under specialty surgery to general surgery, now that we have closed the divestiture of the ASP business, which was the majority of the specialty surgery sales. Advanced surgery declined by 1.4%, but was significantly impacted by COVID-19 which we estimate was almost an 800 basis points impact. COVID-19 primarily impacted o-U.S. results, particularly in endocutters and energy, with an estimated negative impact to global growth of about 900 basis points to each platform. Excluding this negative impact, performance was strong led by energy. Both energy and endocutters performed well outside the U.S. driven by share gains and new products primarily in Asia and were partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S. Biosurgery had an estimated negative impact of over 550 basis points, driven by COVID-19. However, underlying fundamentals, excluding this negative impact, remains strong with growth balance between the U.S. and o-U.S. U.S. performance in biosurgery was driven by continued uptake of SURGIFLO after last year\u2019s stop shipment, coupled with new products such as VISTASEAL. o-U.S. performance continues to be led by market and share performance in the Asia-Pacific region. We also continue to see great uptake of our Monarch system for the diagnosis of lung cancer. Q1 procedures grew 150% compared to the prior year, and almost 2700 procedures have been performed since launch. Wound closure declined over 7% in the quarter with COVID-19 negatively impacting results by an estimated 800 basis points. Growth, excluding COVID-19 was driven by continued strong market growth as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures in China. I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings, for the first quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings, adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.30 reflects reported growth of 9.5% and operational growth of 10.5%. I would like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold de-leveraged primarily as a result of product mix and the establishment of inventory reserves associated with the COVID-19 impact in the Medical Devices business. Selling marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved, driven by leveraging in the pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses and favorable segment mix partially offset by de-leveraging in the Medical Devices business resulting from the COVID-19 impact on sales. We continue to invest in research and development and competitive levels, investing 12.5% of sales this quarter. This was lower than the first quarter 2019 by 180 basis points, driven by timing of pharmaceutical milestone payments partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in the Medical Devices business. The other income and expense line show net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to net income of $22 million last year. This was primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition partially offset by higher unrealized losses on securities. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate declined from 15.2% in the first quarter of 2019 to 11% in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of additional favorable impacts from Swiss tax reform and the reversal of the Auris contingent liability. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15% versus 17.6% in the same period last year, driven by certain tax costs incurred in the first quarter of 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 70 basis points versus the first quarter of 2019 to 35%. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Pharmaceutical margins improved by 360 basis points to 45.3% primarily driven by timing of R&D milestone payments. Medical Devices declined by 540 basis points to 24.2% due to COVID-19 impacts on the business, including incremental inventory reserves and de-leveraging in selling and marketing in addition to continued increased investment in robotics and digital solutions. Consumer margins declined slightly by 50 basis points to 24.5% driven by a one-time gain in 2019 related to the company\u2019s previously held equity investment in Dr. Ci:Labo which was partially offset by leveraging selling marketing and administrative margins in the current quarter. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2020. For your reference, this slide summarizes notable developments occurring in the first quarter. Of note, we submitted new drug applications to the FDA and EMA for Ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. We appreciate that you decided to join the call today unlike others on this call who spoke before me, I hope you and those close to you are safe and healthy. Let me state right upfront, the fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business are strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed combating the current crisis is anything but usual. However, many aspects of Johnson & Johnson continued to operate with a business as usual focus such as advancing breakthrough innovation, fostering consumer and patient access and being financially disciplined. We are motivated by never stopping when it comes to taking care of you, our stakeholders and we can have a profound positive impact, because we are built to lead, built to last and quite frankly, built for times like this. My central focus in today\u2019s prepared remarks is twofold. First, I will share with you our ongoing business continuity plans. It is important particularly in times of challenge that you understand the steps we have put in place recently and over a number of years to ensure reliable supply of the important products we provide. Second, I will outline how we are thinking about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and what that will have on our near-term financial performance in the context of changes from the guidance we issued in January. I trust at the end of the my remarks and at the end of this call, the obvious conclusion is that Johnson & Johnson is strong in a financial position to meet its obligation to all stakeholders and poised for many years of success. The fundamentals of our business are intact. As Alex mentioned earlier, as the most broadly based global company in the healthcare industry, we have established a sustainable and resilient business model with flexibility designed into our research, manufacturing and commercial capabilities. We have robust active business continuity plans across our network, which have been instrumental in preparing us for events like COVID-19. Some steps we have taken recently include leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers to address high risk areas and ensure adequate and effective distribution, working closely with suppliers, distributors, local governments and regulatory to gain better insights to address their concerns through our commercial organizations supporting healthcare providers in the safest way possible by moving to virtual connections to serve as a resource for physicians. Where needed, we directly engage to support them in areas like trauma surgeries ensuring we follow all health protocols to keep everyone safe. Within clinical operations, our first priority is always to protect the health and well-being of participants currently enrolled in our clinical trials. Our next priority is to complete these trials in a manner to fully satisfy regulatory requirements. This pandemic does not change these priorities. As a result of these efforts, we are able to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs. Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to provide insights on a few topics that we typically don\u2019t detail, but are likely top of mind these days for most. From a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $18 billion generating approximately $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter consistent with first quarters of the previous two years. Coupled with our AAA credit rating, we are able to access the capital markets if needed and would anticipate securing the most competitive credit spreads available. A strong balance sheet has been a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson and is most valued in times of macroeconomic distress. We are able to use this strength to benefit many constituents. Some recent examples include partnering with BARDA to jointly invest approximately $1 billion to not only develop and deliver a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, but potentially, in record time. We are complementing the efforts of communities and healthcare heroes through numerous donations and other activities which Alex highlighted. We are supporting small and diverse suppliers and customers, offering financial flexibility at a time when they need it most and we responsibly increased our dividend to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities are clear and remain unchanged. We continue to invest in our business with a bias towards innovation that delivers meaningful products and services to address unmet needs or commercial capabilities that generate greater access to healthy living for more people. It is investing in innovation, particularly in times of uncertainty that will not just bridge the next few months, but the next several years. After investing at or above competitive levels in our business, we look to allocate capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We know that many of our shareholders prioritize that aspect when investing in Johnson & Johnson. Alex announced earlier in the call that for the 58th straight year, we are increasing our dividend. While certainly notable from a historical standpoint, this announcement is important in that it underscores our confidence and optimism for the future. We intend to continue generating strong cash flows and be financially well positioned. Our next priority is to invest our capital in value creating M&A, pursuing transactions that bolster our portfolio or enhance our pipeline while targeting returns that compensate shareholders for the risk we are bearing on their behalf. The current crisis does not reduce our desire to do these transactions. In fact, given our financial strength, we may be in a better position to fund opportunities that will augment sustainable long-term growth. While a second quarter event, a good example of this in practice, is our recently signed preclinical research collaboration with Fate Therapeutics to develop and commercialize off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies for up to four tumor-associated antigens, which we believe has the potential to significantly change the current cell therapy paradigm in the treatment of several distinct cancer types. Finally, within our capital allocation paradigm, as you saw the past few years, we also simultaneously allocate capital to share repurchase programs. We do not have an active program at this time and have no plans to announce a new program as we feel other capital allocation priorities take precedence at this time. Given it is often a question, let me offer a few remarks related to ongoing litigation. With respect to opioids, as announced last October, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigations. The state attorneys generals are engaged and there continues to be cooperation working towards broad participation by the states, cities and counties involved in this litigation. Regarding Talc, as we have previously stated, multiple sources of independent science and third-party testing supports the safety of our products. We await the Daubert hearing outcomes from Judge Wolfson in the Federal District Court of New Jersey. Okay. Let\u2019s move to our guidance for 2020. We know some companies in our peer set have pulled their guidance. We also know that some sell side models have not been updated. We understand that may have been an option for us as well, but in uncertain times, we look forward to offering you as much transparency and credible insight into our view of our business. We have decided to provide updated guidance, given what we know today, with the objective of finding that right balance between bolstering your confidence in Johnson & Johnson, while not providing false assurances. Things will change in the coming days, weeks and months, but at least, still have the benefit of our perspective to consider among the numerous sources you rely upon to make financial sense of the near term outlook. During the next few minutes, I will touch upon each part of our business with greater emphasis on Medical Devices. That segment is currently projected to experience the most significant impact. Let me start, however, by sharing a few assumptions that apply across our entire business. Our guidance attempts to account for the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and the potential impact it will have on the overall healthcare system capturing the potential negative impact on the number of insured individuals and how people may prioritize disposable income in the near term. Second, utilizing the experience in earlier affected markets as a reference, our estimates of the COVID-19 impact assume the relative shape of the COVID-19 curve as being more of an acute shorter-term impact rather than a prolonged impact. For our largest market, the U.S., this assumption is consistent with the estimated mid-April peak assumed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation or IHME. The IHME also predicts mid-to-late April peaks for several European countries. Third, taking into account recent statements by Dr. Fauci and other scientifically accomplished sources, our estimates do not assume the virus returns in the fall with the same intensity currently experienced. What do I mean by that? As the experts have noted in various forums, if the virus does return, the world should be much better prepared to test, identify and isolate it. There may also be therapeutic options available. So, our premise is that elective procedures and doctor visits will largely be permissible in the second half of this year. Finally, we assume a recovery for procedures that begins in the third quarter and improves further in the fourth quarter. We do anticipate some disruption to the economy and have considered it on a smaller scale. Coming out of the second quarter, we assume an improving global economy with lower unemployment, better insurance coverage and higher procedure capacity than what has been or will be experienced at peak. Let\u2019s delve into the segments. The story for Pharmaceuticals is fairly straightforward. Our results in the first quarter confirm the strength of our Pharmaceutical business and we expect it to be resilient. We provide valuable solutions in critical disease states with high unmet need and we largely expect patients will continue to receive and seek treatment. Quite frankly, it is important that they do so to avoid unintended health consequences related to COVID-19 beyond the pandemic itself. With that said, based on what we have seen to date, we do expect a small level of disruption associated with delayed diagnosis and new patient starts. This is driven by two factors. First, data from IQVIA suggests that office visits have recently declined by 30% and that interaction is not being entirely offset by the escalating use of telehealth services. We also know that benefit inquiries have declined suggesting new patient activity has slowed. The second factor is related to physician-administered drugs. For example, some infusion centers are being repurposed as COVID-19 treatment centers and there are staggered infusion times with fewer chairs to comply with social distancing practices. The extent in duration of those two factors comprised the largest variable in our pharmaceuticals outlook. However, the net of it all is that we remain confident in delivering the Pharmaceutical expectation we had in our guidance at the start of the year and anticipate the business to grow above the market again. Looking slightly ahead to next year, we also remain confident in the progression of our pipeline, which should fuel growth beyond 2020. We are partnering with health authorities on the status of our 2020 projected regulatory filings and approvals and have not received notification from regulatory authorities regarding any delays for our major submissions. We continue to progress our plans, prepared to work through any implications related to COVID-19. At this time, our major filings and approvals planned in 2020 are on track. Let\u2019s transition to consumer health. As you heard, the first quarter was very strong for this segment as our essential products are in high demand across the globe. We operate in key categories such as over-the-counter medicines that should continue to perform well as consumers look to self-manage conditions such as fever and pain. However, the first quarter surge was partially due to pantry loading that will not continue for the full year. Access to necessary consumer products across most of our portfolio will continue, but perhaps differently. There will be some impact in certain categories, as a result of reduced store traffic and social distancing behaviors that are not likely to be fully offset by higher e-commerce activity, so we expect some category softness in franchises such as skin health, most notably, sun care products. With that said, we think the upside opportunities at least offset the downside risks and are therefore projecting that here too our full year assumption in January remains intact for the segment. We continue to expect growth above the market in the U.S., while executing the SKU rationalization program mostly focused outside the U.S. So let\u2019s move on to Medical Devices, which is at the core of our guidance change and remains the most uncertain. When I referenced at the outset of this section that some companies have withdrawn guidance, it has been primarily in the medical device segment. So that is a good indication of where the uncertainty exists. Consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter, we expect our medical device business to be negatively impacted as many procedures continued to be deferred and hospital resources are diverted to address the pandemic. We are assuming the most significant negative impact occurs in the second quarter, a lingering impact but signs of stabilization in the third quarter and then some recovery in the fourth quarter. To determine the impact, we started by reviewing external data, including surveys, expert panels, epidemiology, data and capacity constraints. We then reviewed our internal data at the procedural level and weekly sales results at the country level compared to reported cases of coronavirus. Given China was the first country impacted by this pandemic and is believed to be further along in the COVID-19 curve than the rest of the world, we modeled this first. Then given the success that Japan and Korea appeared to have had thus far containing the virus, we decided to bucket all three of these Asia-Pacific markets together, which represents approximately 20% of our medical devices revenue. We then look at the remaining 7 countries in our top 10 markets, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Russia, which collectively makeup approximately 60% of our medical devices revenue. The remaining rest of the world markets outside of our top 10 countries therefore account for 20% of our medical devices revenue. As you know, we have a broad portfolio in medical devices. As this slide depicts, approximately one-third of our medical device business supports urgent procedures that aren\u2019t candidates for deferral, in other words, non-elective such as events that address trauma, stroke and critical surgeries associated with cancer. Based on this procedural classification data and the geographic split I outlined, we develop a range of scenarios to inform the low end and the high end of our estimates. In those key Asia-Pacific markets, we assume that elective procedures will decline 20% to 60% during the second quarter based on trends we are currently observing in those countries. Elective procedures could be down less than this if recovery occurs earlier and ramps backup quickly, but given how much is still unknown we felt this was an appropriate view at this time. We do see stabilization occurring earlier in these countries compared to the rest of the world and expect to start seeing deferred procedures being made up primarily throughout the second half of this year. Using similar methodologies for the other remaining major markets, we assume deferred procedures declined 65% to 85% in the second quarter and declined 20% to 60% in the third quarter versus our prior guidance. We see stabilization in the fourth quarter with these countries starting to recover deferred procedures. The rest of the world assumptions are consistent with these 7 countries. You can also see that we are assuming declines in urgent procedures as well. Individuals are spending less time outdoors engage in physical activity, which we expect to impact procedures even urgent ones, particularly in a market like trauma. In terms of recovery, if hospitals everywhere were doing procedures 24 hours a day, including weekends, they could only increase capacity by about 30%. So we have looked at that as the highest possible increase in capacity which we view as unlikely. We believe hospital systems will have capacity to makeup deferred procedures from earlier in the year, but we suspect it could take time for patients to get comfortable scheduling an elective procedure, hospitals and surgeons may still be recovering from peak COVID-19 impacts and all the economic challenges we have discussed earlier, namely a potential impact to the number of insured patients and a changing prioritization of income in the near-term. Those factors lead us to assume a recovery in a range of 0% to 15%. These assumptions are our best estimates at this time. And again, we are not assuming a recurrence or significant mutation of COVID-19. Similarly, we are not assuming potential aggressive recovery measures that maybe implemented sooner by hospitals, who are experiencing or will experience minimal COVID-19 impact faced with managing unexpected financial challenges resulting from being underutilized. As a result of all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our prior guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact in Medical Device is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise. So let\u2019s summarize this for you. Given all the factors I have described, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following : adjusted operational sales of minus 3% to plus 0.5% incorporating the range of the Medical Device operational sales negative impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion. Moving to operational sales, our guidance is $79.2 billion to $82.2 billion or minus 3.5% to 0%. As we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.09, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points versus the negative 50 basis points provided in our January guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 5.5% to minus 2.0% compared to 2019 or $77.5 billion to $80.5 billion. Moving to items impacting earnings, regarding adjusted pretax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pretax operating margin for the year to decline about a 100 basis points due to higher manufacturing costs related to COVID-19 sales impact, which is partially offset by spending reductions of approximately $2 billion. Net interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $150 million of expense due to lower rates on interest income earned. We are lowering our expectations for net other income. As mentioned earlier, our financial strength may present us with near term opportunities to execute transactions that enhance our current or future portfolio. There is another element to that strength. We are not dependent on selling assets to achieve our long-term objectives. Given the current market conditions and to ensure we create appropriate returns, we are assuming previously planned divestitures will be deferred until such time we can secure commensurate value for these very solid businesses. This decision results in us reducing our previously guided other income by $700 million to a range of $800 million to $1 billion. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be approximately 16.5% to 18.0% wider than the previous range given the variability associated with the sequence and pace of economic recovery across the major regions. Given those updates, we are now comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 11.9% to 7.3%. Again, while not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS, using exchange rates from last week, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share versus our prior guidance impact of negative $0.05. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.50 to $7.90, a range of minus 13.6% to minus 9.0% based on what we know today. A quick illustration of our EPS guidance change from January is presented here. The biggest impacts are obviously from the estimated decline in Medical Device sales and what we believe is a prudent decision to delay some previously planned divestitures. We also have some earnings impact associated with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s multifaceted leadership to combat COVID-19, from vaccine development, employee well-being and addressing healthcare worker needs, totaling close to a $0.25 billion. To help partially offset these items, we are reducing spend by approximately $2.3 billion on a pre-tax basis. But let me be clear, this is largely a reduction aligned to expenses that we believe will naturally be lower. We are not reducing important programs, initiatives or practices that best serve all stakeholders for the long-term. Our investors convey to us that they want us to continue managing for results 2, 5 and 10 years into the future. We do not provide quarterly guidance, but there are two items worth noting for you to consider as you update your models for Q2. The first is likely apparent. We expect the greatest COVID-19 impact on sales to occur in the second quarter. Second, for comparative purposes, recall that in the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a significant divestiture gain as other income. Today\u2019s revised guidance is a clear indication that a gain of that size will not occur in the second quarter of 2020. Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A, let me thank many on the phone listening today. We appreciate the insights you have shared to enhance our thought process and while a 100% precision is not the order of the day, we hope you found the explanation of our guidance updates useful. I also want to thank our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for the extraordinary effort and dedication they have displayed these past few months. I am humbled by the magnificent leadership stories I hear on a daily basis. They serve as an inspiration. Our performance in the first quarter highlights the resiliency of our business during challenging times and showcases the commitment of our employees to advance solutions that enhance the lives of patients and consumers seeking better health. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning and thanks for all the significant work you are doing on behalf of patients in the system as well as the very significant guidance that Joe just provided. Just a couple of quick questions for me. The first for Paul just you talked extensively about the vaccine program and I know your goal is to produce 1 billion doses and you are ramping [production] [ph] throughout the year. So just first question is by the first quarter of \u201821, where do you think production capacity will be and how could that scale through 2021 relative to that 1 billion doses? And I had a quick follow-up for Joe. Paul Stoffels : Yes, production capacity would be ready to go at 600 million to 900 million in the first quarter going up to 1 billion in the course of the year, north of 1 billion by the end of the year. So \u2013 and that\u2019s on an annual basis. So we will have 4 manufacturing sites going on one by one bringing the whole capacity up to 1 billion in the course of the year. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful, Paul. And then Joe just your detailed guidance on medical devices is very much appreciated. On consumer and pharma, obviously we saw in the first quarter some hoarding benefit in consumer and the OTC franchises and probably some stocking benefit in pharma. So those businesses for the year I appreciate are stable. Can you give us any help first to second quarter how we should be thinking about the relative trends of those businesses? Should we expect them to be below trend in second quarter versus first and then pop back up in the third quarter just based on the stocking and hoarding benefits? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Great. Sure, David. Thanks for the questions. I would say you could probably expect that in our consumer unit, you saw significant stocking across the globe probably as Chris referenced was about 7 points of additional growth for the consumer franchise. We were off to a good start, but then you saw the benefit of pantry loading. I would say in pharm remains to be seen. As you know, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. It was only worth about 1 point of growth in the quarter as some PBMs moved from 30-day refill cycles to 90 days. I would imagine that activity will still continue, but we have to see how that plays out a little bit further into the second quarter here when you have stay-at-home protocols. David Lewis : Thanks so much. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, David. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much and again appreciate all the color on the COVID dynamics, very helpful given all the uncertainty out there. So just my two questions here was one, can you just elaborate on the sensitivity of your business to elevated unemployment levels as we look past some of the near-term shutdowns. I guess we are in an environment where we have double-digit unemployment in the near-term and maybe still rates are elevated as we look out into 2021, what does that do to the business as we think about things starting to normalize? My second question was a question about China and just share a little bit about what you are seeing with the business as the economy begins to reopen there and are there any learnings we have found from China that could be helpful as we think about recoveries elsewhere in the world from what you have seen today? Thanks so much. Chris DelOrefice : So, Chris let me take the first question with respect to how we factored unemployment into our modeling specifically around the Medical Device business and maybe I will turn it over to Alex to provide some commentary around what our team is telling us with respect to getting back to things in China. With respect to unemployment, we look back at the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 tried to draw inferences from GDP growth and what that meant relative to elective procedures and procedures in general. So we will have to see how that kind of plays out relative to the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. The team has done a nice job relying on many of the reports and surveys that you in the sell side have conducted to make some assessments, but we will really have to see how it plays out. And that\u2019s why we have widened our range much more than we have traditionally. I think at the outset of the year we had about an $800 million range on our overall enterprise sales guidance. Here you can see it\u2019s about $3 billion of a range and it\u2019s exclusively tied to medical devices. So more to come on that front, but we believe we have got at least a fairly sizable element of that already baked in. Alex, can I turn it over to you for some thoughts on China? Alex Gorsky : Sure, Chris. Thank you very much for the message. And look maybe before I answer that, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, once again acknowledging the tremendous impact that this is having on citizens around the world let alone patients and consumers, this is likely one of the most significant events that any of us have ever experienced in a very personal way. And I think making sure that throughout this particularly as the world\u2019s largest healthcare products company that we remain just incredibly focused on serving them is our number one priority. I think secondly, it\u2019s really acknowledging healthcare workers. I am privileged to have a number of family members frankly who are out there on the frontline making a difference everyday. And when you see what they are doing and literally going into battle and preparing for the worst hoping for the best, working 24/7, without them, I couldn\u2019t imagine the situation we would be in. And then last but not least is the work of our employees. I am incredibly inspired you\u2019ve heard earlier the great progress, the strong progress that we have made on our vaccine program. And while Paul reviewed that perhaps in 10 minutes which is I think really important to keep into perspective is that the work that he is talking about accomplishing literally in 6 to 12 months would usually take between 5 and 7 years. And to do that in a way where there is a relentless focus on safety, on efficacy, on affordability, but also while accelerating those timelines to do everything we can to be touching as you heard in those numbers up to 1 billion people with vaccines in the course of 2021 is it\u2019s a huge undertaking and we have got people working 24/7 everyday of the week right now to really make that possible. Now as it relates to China, Chris, I think that there too it\u2019s important to acknowledge the work of our team member when we first saw this starting to break in late December, early January, we immediately assembled the team. And they began taking actions very quickly obviously to ensure the safety of our employees, but also to ensure the integrity of our supply chain and being able to support the healthcare infrastructure within China. And what we have seen over the past several weeks, I would say is a gradual return of the business. It\u2019s important to remember that in our case in addition to the economic statistics that I think many other people can share given the number of associates that we have on the ground that are literally visiting hospitals even in some more of the remote areas, we are confident that we are starting to see what I would call a reentry into procedures depending on where you are that can range from 50% to as high as 60% or 70% as of today. And there still are areas that are at the low end of that spectrum. We have also heard some comments recently about some concern about a follow-up wave or resurgence and then responding accordingly, but I think overall, we are starting to see a return to a more normal rate of surgical procedures and frankly just the provision of healthcare services vis-\u00e0-vis our pharmaceutical business and our consumer business as well. We have more than 50% of our employees back to work following very specific protocols and directives to ensure their safety, but we are confident that as we proceed in the coming months that we will see a more of return to normal continuing. Thank you. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for all the very helpful color. One question on Medical Devices and the recovery there and one on the vaccine, first on devices, Joe, could you share with us your preliminary thoughts on believe it or not 2021 just the postponed procedures, I heard your comments about the capacity and little catch up assumed for Q4. Just qualitatively, should we think about a lower base in 2020 and normalized growth in 2021 or how should we think about those postponed procedures potentially coming back next year? I had one follow-up. Joe Wolk : Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. As you might imagine, while we hope 2021 looks a lot like we thought it was going to look like maybe 3 months ago. We really have to let that play out. We did see and put into our modeling anywhere from normal level of procedures in the fourth quarter to a recoupment if you will of plus 15%. But it\u2019s really going to depend on the pandemic itself what\u2019s the health priorities, how are patients and consumers feeling about going to the hospital for these procedures. So I believe from what we have heard from hospital CEOs that they would like to get back into business of elective surgeries. Many of you saw recent announcements, Mayo Clinic most recently with respect to just only 25% utilization in their elective suites. That is putting financial strain on major hospital systems and we want to make sure that when we return to normal that there is good quality healthcare still in place. So I will defer I think it would be a little bit irresponsible for me at this point in time to comment on 2021. The hope and the optimism is for whenever the pandemic abates, we will be at or above expectations that we have all once had. Larry Biegelsen : Great. Alex Gorsky : Larry, Larry? Larry Biegelsen : Yes, Alex. Alex Gorsky : Larry, just one other comment on that that I think might be some important perspective is you know as Joe said and as I am sure you can appreciate over the past several weeks we have done our best to be in very close touch with hospital CEOs, with physicians who are working in systems around the country. And what we are currently saying I think is a \u2013 this was consistent with what you have seen in some recent press articles where look there are clearly areas where it has been just a relentless pace of patient care in areas like New York, areas like Northern New Jersey, other hotspots such as New Orleans, Detroit, and there are also other areas in the Midwest where you might say there are hot zones. Outside of that, however and very consistent with Joe\u2019s comments what you see in many cases are hospitals that are well under 50% of their capacity that have also increased some of their investments to the threefold sometimes more and appropriately so preparing for the absolute worst case in a pandemic. But at the same time, they have lost a very significant portion of their income, seeing a cost increase putting potential financial stress on them. And so \u2013 and we are also hearing a consistent theme of making sure that as they think about returning ensuring that we can get consumer and patient confidence back up to the right kind of testing programs, the right kind of protocols in the hospital in place to make sure that we can get healthcare professionals that is physicians, nurses, the kind of assurance that they are going to need to get back to a more normal state of working as well as in some cases given the amount of work they have been doing make sure that they have got the kind of backup resources in place to be able to do that is going to be very, very important as the healthcare systems work with governors and frankly even with Congress making sure the Cares 3 and Cares 4 are accounting for this significant strain on hospitals around the country. So I hope that\u2019s helpful. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s super helpful. Chris, if I can just get one in on the vaccine for Paul, my understanding is Moderna is targeting 4x of base immunity. Paul, what\u2019s your understanding of the base immunity in effective COVID-19 patients? What level do you think you need for an effective vaccine, what are you targeting? Thank you for taking the questions. Paul Stoffels : Well, I can\u2019t definitely give a scientific answer of that, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s tested yet, but what we learned in from Zika, from Ebola and from other vaccines is that we get a strong humeral, but also a cellular immunity with one injection, especially in Zika we saw that. So we think that we can get to very high level of protection with one single vaccine and that it will give us an ability to then protect for longer term, so eventually boosting 1 year later and we think would be sufficient, but we are going to study that in large scale studies in Phase 1 and that will start early September. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for all the work that you are doing during this time and for all the information for modeling. It\u2019s really appreciated. I have two questions. The first one has to do with as we think about procedures coming back in Medical Devices in your conversation with hospitals and physicians and also experienced during other economic downturns, which types of procedures generally come back first and recognizing this is a different lay of the land, but also I just want to think about ortho versus vision care versus surgical or anything that you can add there? And I will say my second question now which is in your conversation with the FDA, what are you seeing or expecting to see in terms of clinical trial enrollment and FDA product approvals? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Okay. Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you for the first one. Look, what we are seeing in the first case and again referring to my earlier comments is I think that there is a keen sense among hospital executives and physicians of the need to try to return to a more normal state of surgery as we see our system be able to work their way through this curve and the virus. And that\u2019s being driven by the way for also a broad recognition that many of the procedures that are currently being delayed will have a healthcare impact on these patients. And we also know for example that the more of a significant hit the economy takes will likely lead to greater rates under insurance and those studies would demonstrate that in a poor economy, healthcare outcomes are poor. So these are not only economic issues, but these are actually healthcare issues driving their desire to get back to work. Also similar to Joe\u2019s point I think every system is trying to decide what does that pace look like as they have to return their operating suites, even some of their ambulatory surgery centers back to more elective procedures. That\u2019s not going to happen overnight. That\u2019s going to take some time for them to reestablish the system. I think there is clear recognition of that. And then regarding the specific procedures, look, we would expect obvious areas such as oncology in general surgery to come back sooner. We would expect there to be also certain areas in orthopedics, while elective, that can have a significant impact on mobility and overall standard of living to come back in next. And then look we think the longer term procedures perhaps cataract surgery in areas of like that, could be what I\u2019d call a third tier. We also believe that the EP, the electrophysiology business would be one that we would also see at faster return too. I mean, there is some concerning data actually regarding the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 and how that could manifest itself in some of these conditions, but at a high level, I think that\u2019s the way we are thinking about it today. Paul or Joaquin, did you want to discuss the impact on clinical timelines? Joaquin Duato : Yes. Thank you, Alex. Joe Wolk : Go ahead, Paul. Why don\u2019t you go? Paul Stoffels : Yes. On \u2013 first on the regulatory, there are not, at the moment, \u2013 we have not got any information from regulatory authorities that the current reviews on review timelines on our current submissions have changed. So that\u2019s going like planned. For our anticipated filings in 2020, we progress as planned and at the moment, for the submissions that are fully recruited, our deal stay unchanged. And then maybe for the submissions that are continuing to recruit patients, we will evaluate in the next few weeks. Clinical trials, we do our best \u2013 utmost best to keep going with minimal delays as we are changing sides and to less impacted areas as well as have different ways of reaching patients and working with the investigators. Alex? Alex Gorsky : And, Joanne, another - just one comment that I would like to make more at a global level here too is to acknowledge the great work that the FDA, and frankly, European authorities and others are making in partnering in an appropriate way to this pandemic our sense is that they have been extremely collaborative in helping to ensure that our ongoing clinical trials that patient care is not interrupted, they\u2019re working with us on how can we make, again, appropriate adjustments along the way. So we\u2019ve been really pleased by the partnering that we\u2019ve been able to have with them, and I just think it\u2019s really important to acknowledge, given all the other dynamics that are taking place right now that they\u2019re making that a priority. Joaquin? Joaquin Duato : Yes. I would also add that this is going to be a particularly strong year for the Pharmaceutical Group in terms of approvals and submissions. In terms of approvals, in the second half of the year, we are expecting four key line extension approvals, one being DARZALEX subcu that we expect in the second quarter, very important for us and very important driver for DARZALEX. We also are expecting TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis. it\u2019s going to give us the opportunity to be the only IL-23 with both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We are expecting SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with suicidal intent and finally we are also expecting IMBRUVICA in frontline CLL in combo with Rituximab, so four major line extension approvals in the second half of the year. Additionally, this is going to be a very strong year for Johnson & Johnson in submissions. We submitted in the first quarter, Ponesimod, a new NME for multiple sclerosis. And we plan to have three additional submissions also during the second half of the year. One is our BCMA CAR-T in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma that has breakthrough designation. The other one, niraparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, that also has breakthrough designation. And finally, our latest one is our bispecific EGFR-cMET in non-small cell lung cancer that will be also submitted at the end of this year. That also has breakthrough designation. So, very strong year from a filing and approvals perspective for the pharmaceutical group. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Operator, we have time for two more questions. I would ask folks to keep their questions to just one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the work the company is doing on the COVID front. Would you be able to share any high-level perspective on what a framework for reopening the country looks like and maybe what are the leading indicators that you\u2019re watching here to understand if you will need to potentially adjust your guidance again? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Yes, Terence, thank you very much and, look, I would also like to acknowledge the great work that I think our teams have done in trying to provide you with a very thoughtful balance and fact-based projection on what we\u2019re seeing in each of our markets. And again it\u2019s been extremely rigorous using a number of quantitative as well as qualitative sources to \u2013 and hopefully the kind of transparency that you are hearing and you\u2019re seeing on this call is indicative of the way we are trying to proceed to ensure that you have got as much information as possible to help understand what we are dealing with. It\u2019s difficult to predict, overall, but I would tell you that there are many efforts here in the United States, certainly, with organizations like the business roundtable there others taking place on a global basis and obviously I think everyone believes that they should start with the science and the data on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of disease progression, particularly in some of the hot spots and what you\u2019re seeing in Italy and Spain, let alone watching the ongoing issue in China with an emphasis on what could happen in a round two or round three, as well as what we\u2019re seeing here in the United States, be it in New York City, Northern New Jersey, but also relative to other places. Frankly, we\u2019re seeing some quite encouraging signs such as California and other areas. So understanding the data in terms of what is the rate of new patient infections versus the rate, for example, of discharges or deaths that are taking place, we think is an important factor. Next, it\u2019s also the availability of some of the testing kits that are available, both at the front end with antigen testing, but at the back end with antibody testing. We\u2019re really encouraged by some of the work that we\u2019re seeing in the diagnostics area and the way the companies who stepped up to try to accelerate availability. Clearly, there were some challenges early on and that are likely \u2013 continue to be some challenges but the more that we can ensure the kind of capacity really that\u2019s necessary with kits, with reagents, with swaps and in these new testing procedures, we think that, again, that\u2019s going to give citizens and others a lot more confidence. I think, third is going to be \u2013 well, likely to be in a state where it will be a combination, the testing and protocols for some time. Even as we return to work, understanding that the workplace, that our lives will be a bit different, but understanding that we can use that data and sometimes maybe even by new tracking devices in conjunction with the test kits, along with these protocols to form, what I\u2019d call, a progressive or more gradual reentry, again ensuring that we continue to build confidence, we continue to watch the data and we do that, by the way, while we\u2019re developing hopefully a therapeutic that would give us an opportunity to intervene in this disease in the coming months. As you know, the biopharmaceutical industry has invested billions of dollars over the past decade \u2013 several decades and it\u2019s not only Johnson & Johnson, other companies are doing tremendous work and working with regulators to see what can be done to accelerate that. And if we can have one or several of those in combination, perhaps, later in the summer or certainly as we head into the fall and then if we can get success with a vaccine, and again, we\u2019re certainly proud of the work that we\u2019re doing that Paul mentioned, but also by the other companies. This would give us a very comprehensive approach as soon as we head into the back end of 2020 and early 2021. This is a disease that can be managed and one that we will have a much better understanding of and hopefully be able to put behind us at the right point in time. Chris DelOrefice : Joe, did you want to comment on leading indicators related to guidance? Joe Wolk : Yes, I would think it really dovetails to what Alex outlined there in terms of returning to work, opening up the economy. We\u2019re going to look for those same telltale signs, how safe is the environment at large with respect to people\u2019s comfort level to going back, being in social settings, going to hospitals to get procedures that they would \u2013 might otherwise defer during a time like this. So we\u2019ll continue to watch those on each weekly basis and the volume that comes through our major markets. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Terence. Appreciate the question. Rob, last question please. Operator : The last question is from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So first question I have for you is could you provide more color on your variable cost structure and what\u2019s in that $2.3 billion decline in spend for this year? And then secondly, how should we think about cash flow for 2020 and 2021 in light of your new guidance? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Louise. So with respect to what\u2019s in the $2.3 billion that I referenced in my prepared remarks. Those are expenses that we expect to naturally fall out as a result of the social distancing or stay-at-home measures, the work-from-home measures that have been instituted across the globe. So think of those in categories such as travel, company meetings. There will be some project delays naturally when people aren\u2019t on site to execute them. I want to be very clear though, we are not rushing to judgment and cutting valuable scientific programs, valuable initiatives within our commercial capabilities or programs that benefit our employees to manage our P&L in the short term. As you heard me say, we think we are very well-positioned for the long term. You heard from Paul, Alex and Joaquin that our clinical trials for our major submissions this year continue to be on track. We are not looking to disrupt this. So we talk to investors regularly. They want us managing for two, five, 10 years out with a long term perspective. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re living into. We think that\u2019s appropriate given with the guidance we provided today and should the need arise, we will look to of course correct as appropriate. With respect to our cash flow, clearly, we will have a little bit of a hit to our original projections. But as a reminder, we are a strong generator of cash flow. Last year, we had an all-time high of about $20 billion in cash flow. We were still up very well into the teens this year in all of our projections. We will see how it plays out relative to this guidance. But we are very well-positioned with $18 billion of cash and access to credit markets, should we need them on a short term basis. But we feel very comfortable with the position, not just for getting through 2020, but then being very strong into 2021. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies, I know we weren\u2019t able to get to a lot of you, but certainly the Investor Relations team is happy to engage with you in more detailed discussions and we appreciate your time on the call today. We hope you find this information valuable and I will now turn the call over to Alex just for some final comments. Alex Gorsky : Hey, thank you, once again, everybody, for your time and the work that you\u2019re doing and I want to end where we started by once again acknowledging the significant impact this is having on citizens, on patients, on consumers around the world. We also believe that this demonstrates the importance of healthcare in everyone\u2019s lives, the impact that it has in a very personal way on people, on families, but also the impact that it has on countries, on economies, on almost every aspect of our lives. And what I can absolutely commit to you is that when we say that at Johnson & Johnson, we are built for time like this, it\u2019s out of humility, knowing the important role that we play and ensuring healthcare is available and accessible in a way where we can truly make a difference for billions of people around the world. So thank you very much. And we will look forward to our upcoming discussions and updates in the coming weeks and months. Bye everybody stay safe and stay healthy. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Christopher DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the second quarter of 2020. I hope everyone is healthy and continues to remain safe during these times.  Joining me on the call today to address Johnson & Johnson's response to the global coronavirus pandemic, along with our second quarter results, are Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of Executive Committee, will also join Paul, Joe and myself.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.  Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.  Our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures, are also available at investor.jnj.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will cover consolidated and segment sales information, along with some operational highlights from the P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Next, Paul will provide an update on our vaccine platform, including our efforts to develop and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine. Finally, Joe will conclude by providing insights on our cash position and how we think about our capital allocation during this time. He will then provide an update on our full year guidance. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.  Worldwide sales were $18.3 billion for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 10.8% versus the second quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, decreased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. In the U.S., sales decreased 8.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported decline was 13.4%. However, operational sales decline outside the U.S. was 9.6% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 3.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales decline was 8.8% worldwide, 8.1% in the U.S. and 9.4% outside the U.S. Results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did see improvement throughout the quarter as countries and states began to reopen. China, for example, returned to growth in the second quarter, led by a strong rebound of our Medical Devices segment.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.36 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.08 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.67, representing decreases of 36% and 35.3%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 34.5%.  Beginning with Consumer Health, I would now comment on business segment sales performance for the second quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will also be providing additional insights using our best estimates on the impacts of COVID-19 to our performance in the areas where it had the largest influence. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.3 billion, declining 3.6%, with operational growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and a decline outside the U.S. of 7.4%. Our Consumer Health segment realized a negative estimated impact associated with COVID-19 of about 700 basis points. This impact was the result of consumers stocking products during the first quarter and lower consumption due to government lockdowns during the second quarter. Our year-to-date growth was 3.6% and normalizes for some of the timing of consumer stocking that occurred in the first quarter.  Excluding the negative impact of COVID-19, our Consumer Health segment delivered solid performance, with continued strong performance in our U.S. OTC and Oral Care businesses. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 11%, with about 30% growth in the U.S. and a 5% decline outside the U.S... In the U.S., we estimate about 2/3 of the growth was due to the COVID-19 pandemic as we continue to see strong demand and share gains for Adult Tylenol. Additional brands driving growth include U.S. PEPCID due to share gains from a competitive withdrawal from the market and continued strong performance of Zarbee's Naturals. Outside the U.S., declines were primarily driven by COVID-19 restrictions, most notably in China, partially offset by an increase in antismoking consumption.  Our Oral Care franchise was positively impacted by COVID-19 as the franchise grew 6.3% from strong demand of Adult Listerine primarily in the U.S. across multiple channels. Growth outside of the U.S. was also driven by Asia Pacific from promotional activities and new product launches of Adult Listerine.  The Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 14.3% and was the franchise that was most negatively impacted by COVID-19 due to changes in consumers' skin health and beauty routines. The U.S. declined by 19.2% from reduced consumption of sun care, cosmetics and facial care products, impacting the NEUTROGENA and AVEENO brands. Outside the U.S., our Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined by 8.2%, primarily from the COVID-19 impact in Asia Pacific and SKU rationalization initiatives in EMEA.  And in our remaining Consumer Health franchises, Baby Care, Women's Health and Wound Care/Other all declined primarily due to COVID-19. Global Baby Care declined 11.6% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. The U.S. grew when you exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture, primarily due to increased COVID-19 demand. The COVID-19 increased demand in the U.S. was more than offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 outside the U.S., primarily in Asia Pacific. The slower performance outside the U.S. was also negatively impacted by the SKU rationalization program and lapping of Johnson's restaged launch in EMEA. Globally, we continue to see strong growth in AVEENO Baby.  Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.8 billion grew 3.9%, enabled by growth across all regions and in all key therapeutic areas, except for the cardiovascular, metabolism and other therapeutic area, due primarily to biosimilar competition on PROCRIT. We realized double-digit growth in 8 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 5.8% and outside the U.S. by 1.4%.  Our growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by COVID-19, driven by delayed diagnosis and slower new patient starts due to office closures and access to physician-administered drugs as well as the phasing impact of stocking in the first quarter. The products most impacted by COVID-19 were DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, STELARA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and our pulmonary hypertension portfolio. And we estimate impact on these products to be worth roughly 300 to 350 basis points to our worldwide Pharmaceutical growth. Despite this impact, global operational growth for the first half of the year is strong at 7%, which remains above expected market growth. While not significant in total, our second quarter results did include favorable prior period pricing adjustments in the U.S. to XARELTO and INVOKANA, partially offset by a negative adjustment to STELARA.  Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 5.7%. Our prior year results included a favorable onetime adjustment for DARZALEX related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries. Excluding this impact, growth for the total oncology portfolio was about 9% for the quarter or 15% on a year-to-date basis.  DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 18.8% globally. Excluding the previously mentioned onetime adjustment, worldwide growth was about 33%. And excluding the negative impact of COVID-19, we estimate that DARZALEX growth would have been more in line with previous quarters. The U.S. grew 32.9% with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline indications for multiple myeloma. During the quarter, we launched a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and Europe, an innovative fixed-dose formulation, which can be administered in 3 to 5 minutes and offers a clinically meaningful reduction in infusion and administration-related reactions. We are pleased with the uptake of this new product and the benefit it provides to our patients and health care providers.  IMBRUVICA grew 17% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. While negatively impacted by delayed diagnosis and the reversal of Q1 stocking related to COVID-19 in the quarter, IMBRUVICA growth year-to-date is strong at over 25% as IMBRUVICA remains the best-in-class BTK inhibitor and is the new and total patient share leader in CLL line 1, CLL line 2+ and MCL line 2+.  ERLEADA continued its strong launch trajectory with sales more than doubling versus prior year. During the quarter, we presented results at the Annual ASCO Conference from the final analysis of the pivotal Phase III SPARTAN study, demonstrating that ERLEADA significantly improved overall survival in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Slightly offsetting these results were declines in ZYTIGA and VELCADE, primarily due to generic competition.  Moving now to immunology. Globally, sales grew 3% in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Internationally, sales grew double digits at 11%, offsetting a slight decline in the U.S. of under 1%. Second quarter growth for our immunology portfolio as well as the overall market was impacted by COVID-19-related delayed diagnosis, access and the impact of first quarter stocking. Year-to-date, immunology growth is 7.9% worldwide and U.S. growth is 5.1%.  STELARA growth of about 10% was driven by continued share gains in Crohn's disease with about a 7-point share increase in the U.S. and growth from the recently approved ulcerative colitis indication. STELARA growth was negatively impacted by a prior period price adjustment impacting growth by over 250 basis points globally and was negatively impacted by COVID-19. On a year-to-date basis, STELARA growth remains strong at about 20% globally. TREMFYA, the first-in-class market-leading IL-23 inhibitor therapy, grew 46% globally and achieved roughly a 10% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 3 points from the second quarter of 2019. We are excited to share that TREMFYA received FDA approval earlier this week for adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.  Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of about 14% from share loss due to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing almost 9%, led by double-digit U.S. growth of 13.8% due to market growth in the U.S., along with share gains for INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA. We continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO, where the unmet need remains high.  In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 4.7%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products.  Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio posted double-digit growth of 15%, driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of 17.6% and 39.5%, respectively, driven by increased market penetration and share growth.  I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $4.3 billion, declining by 32.7% due to the negative impact of COVID-19 restricting elective procedures across all regions. Sales declined in the U.S. by 39.6% and declined 26.4% outside the U.S. Given the negative impact of COVID-19 across all platforms, my commentary will focus on key trends in each platform. As expected, our Q2 results included 1 additional selling day versus prior year, positively impacting results by about 50 basis points. We expect a minor benefit in Q3 from selling days. Interventional Solutions declined by 20.5% globally, with a U.S. decline of 30.5% and an OUS decline of 10.9%. Interventional Solutions saw improvement throughout the quarter, returning to growth in June at almost 3%. China had a particularly strong recovery, growing double digits in the quarter. The U.S. returned to growth in June, led by electrophysiology performance. Procedures in electrophysiology over the last 2 weeks of the month averaged 91% of pre-COVID levels across the U.S., with the Northeast part of the country recovering at the slowest rate, primarily due to the New York City metro area.  Orthopedics declined by 33.9% in the quarter due to market declines from restrictions on deferrable procedures and reductions in general activity such as travel and recreation that negatively impacted trauma. The U.S. saw the largest recovery of all regions, with June declining less than 8% versus prior year as U.S. hips grew high single digits and U.S. trauma was flat. Knees and spine also showed improvement globally throughout the quarter with June declines of around 21% and 15%, respectively. For the quarter, U.S. pure price improved slightly versus previous quarters across all platforms. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery declined by 22.9%, with worldwide energy and endocutters declining about 27% for the quarter and less than 20% in the month of June. Biosurgery declined less than 13% in Q2 as results were positively impacted by almost 9 points due to the recovery from the SURGIFLO stopped shipment in Q2 2019. Biosurgery returned to growth in the month of June, led by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. General Surgery declined 39.5%. In addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, global sales were negatively impacted by 10 points due to an unfavorable prior period pricing adjustment in the U.S. The impact was primarily related to COVID-19, providing enhanced insight into the level and mix of inventory in our distributor channel, resulting in the need to increase our reserves. Wound closure declined almost 28% for the quarter, with June declining 17%.  Vision declined by 39.3% in total, with contact lenses declining 33.6% and surgical declining 55.2%. Contact lenses was negatively impacted by COVID-19, which resulted in less new wearers entering the category due to the shutdown of optical stores and lower consumption for existing wearers as people spent more time at home. The e-commerce channel, which primarily serves existing wearers, is estimated to have a slight decline versus the second quarter of prior year, representing significant outperformance compared to other channels. Contact lens performance is recovering overall as geographies start to open back up, with June declining approximately 26% versus prior year.  I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $1.67 reflects a reported decline of 35.3% and an operational decline of 34.5%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins declined, driven by the negative impact of Medical Device sales, partially offset by favorable segment mix, expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business and optimized brand marketing expenditures in the Consumer Health business. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the second quarter 2019 by 180 basis points, driven by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Device sales and segment mix.  The other income and expense line showed net expense of $24 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the net income of $1.7 billion last year. This was primarily driven by the ASP divestiture gain of $2 billion in the second quarter of 2019.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate declined from 20.4% in the second quarter of 2019 to 8% in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of recording additional adjustments to the transitional provision of Swiss tax, which benefited the rate by approximately 7.5 points. We expect no further adjustments to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform and encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 19.3% in the same period last year, primarily driven by Swiss tax reform adjustments.  Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise declined versus the second quarter of 2019 to 29.1%. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Pharmaceutical margins improved by 250 basis points to 44.1%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling and marketing expense leveraging. Medical Devices declined to 1.2%, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including significant sales declines coupled with continued overhead cost and idle manufacturing expenses. Additionally, 2019 results included the gain of approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. Consumer margins improved by 310 basis points to 24%, driven by planned prioritization and optimization of brand marketing expenses.  That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Paul. Paulus Stoffels : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our vaccine program, particularly our progress on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.  As you know, we announced our lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate on March 30. And since then, we have made significant progress. We have seen strong preclinical data so far, which were published in the Journal of Science in May. These data validated the preclinical vaccine challenge model and showed that prototype DNA vaccines were able to create strong immunity. Based on these data and interactions with regulatory authorities, we were able to accelerate the clinical development program of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Since then, we have initiated a study of a final Ad26 vaccine candidate in nonhuman primate challenge model. These results will be published in a major scientific journal in the coming weeks.  Based on this total package of results, we are very comfortable moving forward with Phase I/IIa studies later this month. This represents an acceleration of our time line from our original date of September to the end of July. These studies will establish both the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate as well as evaluate the single dose and the booster dose regimen. The trials will be conducted in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years as well as adult aged 65 years and older. Our study sites are located in the U.S. and Belgium. We are also planning for a Phase II study in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany and plan to conduct a Phase I study in Japan. We anticipate the initiation of the trial on July 22 in Belgium and the following week in the U.S. We are also in discussions with the National Institute of Health with the objective to start a Phase III clinical trial ahead of its original schedule, potentially in late September, to evaluate the effectiveness of our vaccine. We are using epidemiology data to predict and plan where our study should take place. We also announced that, in parallel with the clinical development, we are working to expand our global manufacturing capacity to be able to deliver more than 1 billion doses of our COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. We have made excellent progress on this front as well.  In addition to building out our internal manufacturing capabilities, we entered into collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions and Catalent Biologics and others to support commercial manufacturing of the vaccine. As you have heard me say previously, our COVID-19 vaccine program is leveraging Janssen's adenovector technology that provides the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates. The same technology was used to construct our HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates.  And to develop our Ebola vaccine regimen, we just received marketing authorization from the European Commission for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The EMA approval is the culmination of work that begun in response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014. Achieving major regulatory approval in this time frame is a tremendous accomplishment. The approval marks the first major regulatory approval of a vaccine developed by Janssen, confirming the potential of our adenovector technology. To date, more than 80,000 people have been vaccinated using this vaccine technology.  As we have previously shared, we are also working on an HIV vaccine and are pleased to report that we have reached an important milestone. Earlier this month, our Imbokodo trial, taking place across Sub-Saharan Africa, reached an important milestone with all people having completed all study vaccination despite difficult COVID-19 circumstances. And we expect the outcomes of this study in the next 2 years. Together with our partners at the NIH and The Gates Foundation, we now have the most advanced HIV candidate in clinical development. These recent milestones strengthen our confidence in our vaccine technology.  The work we are doing today to help address the COVID-19 pandemic built on more than 130 years of Johnson & Johnson's leadership in public health. We believe we have a responsibility to step in and invest in solutions for global public health crisis and are proud to be contributing to the global response to COVID-19. Our efforts to expedite the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and to identify potential treatments are enhanced by multiple collaborations with government, academia, health authorities and others worldwide. And we are working with them to ensure the broadest possible access to people around the world. Thank you.  Joe, I will now turn it over to you. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Paul, not only for that encouraging update, but to you and your team for leading the rapid and responsible advancement of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It is one of many actions that illustrate how Johnson & Johnson is deploying our range of capabilities to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as we aspire to do across health care for patients and consumers who count on us each and every day.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and those close to you continue to be safe and healthy. While the second quarter was strong relative to expectations, the main message my colleagues and I want you to take away from today's call is that the long-term fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business remains strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed. An indicator of that strength is our balance sheet, so let me briefly touch upon our cash position and capital allocation thoughts before getting into guidance commentary.  We ended the quarter in a net debt position of $11 billion, made up of cash and cash equivalents of $19 billion and debt of $30 billion. We did issue commercial paper in the quarter for additional liquidity at favorable interest rates commensurate with our financial strength. Our long-term capital allocation strategy remains intact. We'll continue to prioritize investing in innovation, returning capital to shareholders by paying dividends and increasing them annually, as we have done for 58 years, and then capitalizing on strategic acquisition opportunities that fortify our existing portfolio while simultaneously compensating shareholders for the risks we bear on their behalf. Earlier, Chris provided specific commentary related to COVID-19 impacts that our business experienced in the second quarter. I will now provide some industry context regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and what that may mean to our business going forward.  With respect to the health care industry, we are encouraged to see many procedures starting to return versus what we saw in the back half of the first quarter across the globe. For example, according to IQVIA, office visits are down approximately 10% to 15% as of late June compared to the earlier stages of the pandemic in mid-April when office visits were down almost 70%. So still down, but showing improvement. This is indicator for our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments.  Johnson & Johnson is developing programs to alleviate patient concerns related to elective surgeries and procedures as well as helping the overall industry treat patients with new public education materials and resources that increase patient confidence and inspire people to prioritize their health. In consumer, based on U.S. Nielsen data, we saw the categories we compete in decline in April by 10%. However, June data suggests those categories declined, but with an improving trend falling just 2% to 3%. With that high-level backdrop, I will now update you on how we are thinking about performance for the balance of 2020. Our objective with guidance, as always, is to transparently provide information that is useful for you, identifying key assumptions and highlighting factors less clear that may influence our current full year outlook. Similar to our guidance update in April, it is important to caveat that the impact of the pandemic is very fluid and likely to continue evolving over the coming weeks and months. As such, our perspective relies upon numerous internal and external sources to help inform financial projections related to our near-term outlook.  What does that include? Our assumptions consider external expert assessments related to the macro impact of COVID-19 and potential negative consequences it may have on the overall health care system on the number of insured individuals and evolving consumer and patient spending in addition to the frame of mind related to health care behavior when it comes to, for instance, elective procedures and office visits. We are also relying on numerous conversations that Alex, Ashley, and our Medical Device leaders are having with hospital system administrators and surgeons related to capacity, the preparedness for potential spikes of the virus, the improvements that have been implemented to treat COVID-19 patients and the economics of their institution. Lastly, we review extensive analytics on our business that account for individual weekly hospital trends.  Taking these quantitative and qualitative factors into account, let's delve into our updated 2020 guidance, beginning with our Pharmaceutical business. Our expectations for our Pharmaceutical business remain unchanged. In Q2, we did experience reduced patient interactions with health care providers which impacted new patient starts and lower activity for physician-administered drugs, but we are seeing improvement in recent weeks for those areas. You may recall Q1 was very strong, with a modest piece of that strength attributable to pharmacy providers offering longer prescription durations, which slightly impacted Q2 results negatively. All in all, the strength of our Pharmaceutical portfolio that addresses significant patient need gives us confidence to expect above-market growth in 2020 once again.  Regarding our Consumer Health segment. Here, too, we see no changes to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We are off to a fast start in over-the-counter medicines and Oral Care, with those franchises growing year-to-date 2 to 3x versus what we grew in 2019, reflecting some increased COVID-19 demand. As Chris shared, that growth is partially offset by results in other categories, namely skin health/beauty, primarily due to COVID-19. We are proceeding as planned with the SKU rationalization program mentioned in January to improve future operating margins.  Shifting to Medical Devices. Changes from the guidance we offered in April are driven by what we have learned since then. And similar to the first quarter, these assumptions are the most ambiguous at this time. As expected, the medical device industry continues to experience near-term negative impacts while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address COVID-19. We assume the most significant negative impact to Medical Devices would occur in the second quarter. That is still our expectation.  In April, based on data available at the time, we assumed a weighted average decline across all markets and all procedures in the second quarter of 40% to 60% versus our original expectations to start the year. As you can see on this slide, total Medical Devices performed better than that assumption as economies around the world began opening sooner than anticipated, but was still down approximately 35% in the quarter. Importantly, we are encouraged by the improvement we saw in each month in the second quarter, with the month of June being down the least at approximately 25% versus our original expectations. Not surprisingly, urgent procedures declined at a lesser rate than procedures considered deferrable.  As we think about the remainder of 2020, the ramp of the recovery is the most difficult variable to estimate. When we provided guidance in April, we expected the impact of COVID-19 in Medical Devices to linger throughout Q2 and Q3 with a recovery in Q4. However as just noted, we experienced a faster recovery than anticipated. And thus, the backlog of patients we originally predicted in Q4 as a result of pent-up demand is now presumed to occur earlier in the year.  Additionally, given China was the first country impacted and Japan and Korea were seeing early success in containing the virus, we bucketed these 3 markets together when providing guidance in April. As you can see, China has been the first market to recover and returned to double-digit growth versus prior year in Q2. However, Japan and Korea saw new cases rise early in the quarter and implemented restrictions, resulting in declines consistent with the rest of total Medical Devices. Similarly, the bucket of countries we defined as major markets saw some countries like Germany outperforming our overall Medical Devices business, whereas other markets such as the U.S. declined 40% versus our original expectations to start the year.  Clearly, the countries bucketed together in our April framework are performing differently from each other and therefore are no longer the best representation of how our business will perform going forward. Additionally, the dynamics within a country can be very different across communities. Our evolving detailed procedural model allows us to forecast at a granular level within each country. As such, we are not relying on the previous regionally based buckets and instead are providing our expectations for Q3 and Q4 for total Medical Devices to provide visibility to the impact in a simplified manner. In Q3, we now expect a decline of 10% to 25% versus our original expectations to start the year, a smaller decline than we incorporated in our April guidance. In Q4, we are now assuming a decline of 15% to 0%, consistent with my remarks from a moment ago, with the pent-up demand we were anticipating largely occurs throughout quarters 2 and 3. Considering all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $3.8 billion to approximately $5.3 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our original January guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact on Medical Devices is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise.  Now we often get asked about a second wave of COVID. Our thinking continues to be that, if that occurs, it should not have the same level of global impact that's been experienced in the last 4 months. This assumption is based on opinions shared by various experts as they believe, as do we, that if this occurs, the world is much better prepared. How so? Testing is more readily available. Remarkably, over 700,000 tests now occur daily in the U.S. alone. There is adequate supply of necessary medical equipment. Isolation and other preventative measures are being implemented quickly with more precision. Treatment protocols continue to improve, and there may be therapeutic options available. Finally, a portion of the population will have developed antibodies. While 1 death is too many, with a rapidly declining death rate related to the virus, the health care system is much better positioned than when the virus first appeared. Therefore, while we actively monitor the rising case rate, our premise is that procedures and doctor visits will be largely permissible in the second half of this year.  So let's summarize our Medical Device outlook. We still estimate the most significant negative impact occurred in Q2, but the impact to both Q2 and Q3 is now expected to be less than what we were anticipating in April. This upside is partially offset in Q4 compared to our April guidance as that predicted bolus of patients is now assumed to have occurred earlier in the year. We are seeing signs of recovery. And while the next few months and quarters contain uncertainty, the long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid. And most importantly, we continue to see tremendous potential over the long term to serve our patients and customers. Given all these factors, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following. Adjusted operational sales of minus 0.8% to positive 1.0%, incorporating the latest range of negative Medical Device operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $5 billion versus January guidance. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $81 billion to $82.5 billion or minus 1.3% to a positive 0.5%. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.13, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 130 basis points versus the negative 200 basis points provided in our April guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 2.6% to minus 0.8% compared to 2019 or $79.9 billion to $81.4 billion. We are maintaining our expectation for operating margins with a decline year-over-year of 100 basis points as well as April guidance ranges of net other income and net interest expense. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be 16.5% to 17.5%, tighter than the previous range. Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.85 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 9.6% to 7.3%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our April guidance impact of a negative $0.15. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.75 to $7.95, a range of minus 10.7% to minus 8.4%. I know many of you are interested in our thoughts beyond 2020, so I thought I would say a few words on very early thinking on select topics for next year. In our Pharmaceutical business, we don't anticipate new biosimilar or generic competitors and expect another year of above-market performance, largely driven by increased penetration and new indications across our existing diversified portfolio led by key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA. In our Consumer Health business, we will continue to focus on delivering solid growth in our core strongholds of OTC and skin health and continued expansion of the e-commerce channel. In Medical Devices, based on what we know today, we expect procedures to be largely permissible throughout the year. And given COVID-19's impact on 2020, we expect to deliver robust double-digit operational sales growth. Regarding the P&L for 2021. While not providing guidance at this very early stage, I will share that we are expecting other income and expense to be consistent with the guidance I just shared for 2020. In addition, while we continue to manage our portfolio with rigor, emphasizing platforms where we can optimize our success, we are planning to treat future significant divestiture gains as a special item going forward. We would expect to improve operating margins from this year's level given higher sales as well as realizing benefits from our SKU rationalization initiative in Consumer Health. And finally, as a reminder, when comparing revenue next year versus this year, our 2020 fiscal calendar has the benefit of additional 2 to 3 shipping days associated with a 53rd week. Robust plans are being developed and will be finalized as we move throughout 2020. We anticipate strong EPS growth in 2021 on an operational basis given some of the dynamics at play in 2020, and commit to providing updates as appropriate on future earnings calls. Let me conclude prepared remarks with our key developments in the quarter. As we look at our pipeline, we have been able to advance a majority of our portfolio despite COVID-19, but I'd like to highlight a few items. Beginning with the Pharmaceutical pipeline. In addition to the progress Paul referenced on the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we had a number of approvals in the second quarter included on this slide, several ahead of their PDUFA dates. Most notable are TREMFYA for active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., DARZALEX for subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, IMBRUVICA frontline in CLL combo with rituximab in the U.S. and the Ebola vaccine in the EU. We updated our filing time line slightly for our BCMA CAR-T. We remain on track to initiate the U.S. regulatory application by year-end 2020 and have updated timing of the EU submission to early 2021, which accounts for comprehensive manufacturing and commercial plans.  You will also note that we are no longer filing niraparib in line 3 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The data from the Phase II GALAHAD study did demonstrate a highly competitive efficacy and safety profile for niraparib, which supported FDA breakthrough therapy designation. However, recent approvals of other agents in this class have removed the path to gain accelerated approval for niraparib based on this single-arm study. Considering this development, we will not be moving forward with regulatory submissions with GALAHAD, but niraparib remains an important part of our prostate cancer pipeline, with $1-billion-plus revenue potential. Turning to Medical Devices. We continue to advance our innovation agenda with some notable achievements in the quarter, such as : U.S. FDA breakthrough designation for Monarch-enabled NeuWave ablation technology; CE Mark for Heliostar, our single-shot balloon catheter; and CE Mark for QDOT, a microcatheter enabling better lesion treatment, just to highlight a few. We also continued to advance digital surgery offerings. Since launch, there have been over 3,200 lung biopsies completed using the Monarch system. We will also expand the system with multi-specialty applications with endourology next in line for U.S. approval with the treatment of kidney stones, a market that is almost twice the size of the one we are in today. We continue to make great progress towards a second half 2020 U.S. regulatory submission for our orthopedic robotics solution as part of our VELYS digital surgery platform, first in knees, coming out of our acquisition of Orthotaxy. In General Surgery, we will incorporate elements from the general surgery robotic platforms of both Verb and Auris, which we believe enhances our value proposition and increases our ability to create a differentiated platform for surgeons. We continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. And based on these conversations, we will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway in the U.S. After analyzing time to market compared to overall value proposition, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022. We continue to be very excited about the overall program and that our continued investment here will offer a differentiated and competitive product to the market with better outcomes for patients. The new time lines are based on what we know today, reflecting a world that is very different than what it was just a few short months ago. One item occurring after the second quarter close and not listed on this slide was Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation's sale of the equity position in Idorsia. As part of the Actelion acquisition in 2017, you may recall that we employed an innovative deal structure resulting in the formation of a new company, which is now established. We remain very excited about our ongoing partnership with Idorsia on assets like Ponesimod and Aprocitentan.  Before I hand the call back to Chris, I want to express our sincere gratitude to our 132,000 associates around the world. Johnson & Johnson's strong foundations begin with their tireless effort and unwavering dedication to elevating the standards of health care. In a tumultuous year, they remain focused on credo values and meeting commitments to patients, doctors and nurses, employees, parents and children, communities and shareholders. Without them, our current and future success would not be possible. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion. Christopher DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just two for me. Can you maybe first talk about -- I think you addressed the potential for a second wave, but any early read in terms of what you're seeing in some of the regions in the U.S. that are seeing a rapid increase in COVID cases? Are those still -- states still seeing a recovery in procedure volumes? Or are you starting to see some slowdown in volumes in some of those regions? And then my second question was on the Vision business and just elaborate on some of the trends and how you're thinking about recovery there. It seems like that's one of the segments of the market that might be seeing a bit of a lagging recovery versus some of your other device businesses. I'm just interested in how you're thinking about that franchise over the coming quarters. Alex Gorsky : Chris, this is Alex. Can you hear me okay on the audio? Christopher Schott : Yes. Alex Gorsky : Okay. Chris, first of all, thank you very much for the question. And look, before I start off answering directly to your question, I just want to continue to acknowledge the great work of our colleagues across Johnson & Johnson, as we just shared with you in the second quarter. And while we're going to be reviewing a lot of statistics and a lot of facts and a lot of figures on the call today, I also think it's always important to acknowledge the direct impact that COVID-19 has had on patients, it's had on family and friends for all of us in some way. And also, I'd be remiss if I didn't do a shout out for the frontline health care workers, the doctors, the surgeons, the nurses, the assistants who have been showing up for the last 5 months dealing with just an unprecedented pandemic, learning real-time and adjusting as necessary, literally working 24/7.  And finally, our own J&J workers, nearly 1/3 of our workforce who have continued to show up to ensure that we could have supply of our products as well as continue the important research and the development, not only on our vaccine, but on so many other therapeutics, devices and consumer products for patients and consumers around the world. So Chris, as I have reached out and been able to connect with CEOs of hospital systems across the United States, but also more broadly with other administrators around the world, as we've taken a look at the data, clearly, we believe that the virus' spread has accelerated, particularly in the South, Southeast, the Southwest and Far West. What we're -- what they are seeing in the hospital right now is clearly a resurgence over the previous rates. Similar to Joe's earlier comments, the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in the hospitals, but it's important to note that, in certain counties, certain cities and localities, be it Dade in Florida, Miami, Palm Beach, areas around Dallas -- excuse me, Houston, San Anton, San Diego, Los Angeles, that the rates are increasing at a very significant rate.  I think the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in terms of the kind of equipment that they have on hand. Testing still depends on where you are. While testing rates have increased dramatically, there are still -- there still remain spottages in particular areas and other areas where hospitals have ramped up their own laboratory capabilities, combined with others. They think that they're getting the results in a reasonable period of time. And of course, they've got better protocols in place in terms of understanding, whether it's treating with dexamethasone, anticoagulants and other approaches that are leading to better outcomes.  I think the things that we're -- they're continuing to watch very closely is the exact incidence rate and how that unfolds in the coming weeks and months, we think it's going to be critical. I mean, thus far, as we alluded to, the death rates and the hospitalization rates have not -- while increasing, have not been the same as we saw very early. But the next few weeks are going to be critical, and obviously, we're going to have to watch that very closely.  And I think something else that the hospitals are keeping a close handle on are the staffing. Because in many cases, just as they were beginning to ramp back up with elective procedures and bring staffing back on. Now they're having to, in many cases, reallocate it based upon the surge that they're seeing take place.  I think the other important factor is they learned a lot about reopening-up their surgical suites and also how to create additional space for ICU and CCU patients. They've seen some of the detrimental effect of these delayed procedures. Therefore, they, as much as possible, want to try to continue ensuring the patients can get access to those procedures even while managing the pandemic. But again, depending on where they are, there have been some areas where they shut down elective procedures and they're managing it based upon the case load they're seeing. So that's an overall response. If I back up just one more step, if we look at the data through the end of June, I think Chris alluded to this in his remarks as well as Joe, across the United States and the majority of the surgical categories that we're operating in, we're seeing about a return to 85% to 90% of what we did in pre-COVID baseline periods. But obviously, we're going to watch that closely as we watch the numbers and the areas I mentioned increase, at least as of late and in the coming weeks. Joseph Wolk : Chris, this is Joe. Maybe just to pick up with respect to your questions around Vision Care specifically. So contact lenses was down a little bit over 30% in the quarter. Clearly the impact of COVID-19 as there's just simply less new wearers entering the category due to a shutdown of optical stores, but also lower consumption for existing wearers as people adopt shelter-in-place measures and stay at home. The e-commerce channel, which primarily serves existing wearers, was also down when you compare it to the second quarter of last year. But we are seeing an improved performance. So if you look at June, contact lenses was down almost 25% versus the prior year. So you're seeing that same quarterly improvement throughout -- the monthly improvement throughout the quarter with respect to contact lenses. In terms of Vision Surgical, I would say that's probably one of the most deferrable procedures out there. And so as we start to see elective procedures become more prevalent, we would expect that to return as well. Christopher DelOrefice : Yes. Chris, I would just add on Vision Care. I think when you think of our contact lens business going forward, we've had consistent strong performance there with at- or above-market performance levels the past 4 years and have had a very strong cadence of innovation 2019, Transition Light Intelligent Technology; 2020, we're excited about our ACUVUE Theravision, first anti-allergy contact lens. And then did receive FDA breakthrough device designation on our myopia control lens. So it's a franchise that we feel very strong about going into the future. Operator : Your next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Maybe one for Paul on the vaccines and a quick commentary on recovery for Joe. Paul, just to start off on vaccines for a second here, just two quick ones. Our sense is the FDA wanted hundreds of exposures before allowing Phase II trials. So I guess, what's your confidence you're going to have the data needed to start those Phase III trials later this year? And then a lot of investors are focused on sort of humoral versus cellular immunity. I just wonder if you could talk to the durability of neutralizing antibodies and whether we should expect the CD8 response. And frankly, does that matter, in your view? And then a quick recovery comment for Joe. Paulus Stoffels : Well first, from experience, to start the clinical trial, we have developed a vaccine platform over the last 6, 7 years. And we have now more than 80,000 people who have been vaccinated by our platform. And that is in RSV, in Zika, in HIV and Ebola. And that gives very good comfort that we have a safe platform. In addition to that, we have been able, in RSV and Zika, to use a high dose, at 110-11, for those who know what it means, is that is the highest dose you can administer, but with almost no fever. So we will be able to administer a very high single dose, which will be enabled in our Zika and in our RSV, will elicit a very strong neutralizing antibody response as well as a cellular immunity response with one single dose. Whether we need to boost for durability, we have learned that in Ebola, we have learned that in others, that maybe yes, but not immediately. We are going to test a boost dose as we start, but we think more that we will have to boost 1 year or 2 years after the single high dose.  So we're going to learn fast. And with a single-dose Phase I study, we should be able to start mid-September with the experience we have, and that's in full discussion with the regulatory authorities around the world. Joseph Wolk : David, your second point? Christopher DelOrefice : Are you there? On your question on recovery? Operator? Rob, are you there... Operator : Yes, I'm here. Christopher DelOrefice : Let's move on to the next question. We can always come back to David if need be. Operator : Sure. Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : I'll ask one recovery and one vaccine question as well. Just on the recovery, thanks so much for the data, Alex. Just when you talk at the end of June, 85% to 95% of pre-COVID levels and the spike in cases in the South, are you seeing other parts of the world offset that? And so in other words, you're still seeing improvements in trends through mid-July? And then second, for Paul. When are we going to see the initial human clinical data? And you didn't mention when you expect availability of the vaccine. I think your prior comments were maybe early 2021. Are you still going to seek EUA approval based on the Phase I/II trial? Or do you think you'll need the Phase III data for approval? Alex Gorsky : Sure, Larry. Let me respond to the first, and then I'll ask Paul obviously to cover the second. Look, the data that we're citing, we're trying to provide the most up-to-date information we had, which basically goes with the data through the latter part of June, I think for the first couple of days in July. And if we look across the world, we see basically most of the -- majority of countries up over 85%. And what I mean by that is if we're tracking their weekly recovery rate and we compare that to pre-COVID period and we adjust for that over a several-week period, those numbers are in the, I would say, north of 80% to 85% range.  The one outlier to that is the U.K. The U.K. is still below 50%. And again, we're clearly developing the ability to track this, not only on a country and a region basis, but the United States on a -- literally on state, a county and city and individual hospital bases. And again, there are differences at each one of those levels. But at an overall country level, if we take about the top 12 markets around the world, what I'd say is the overwhelming majority of them are north of 85%, with the outlier being the U.K. Christopher DelOrefice : Larry, I think on that one, China is a good example where we continue to see very good progress and momentum, with double-digit growth in recent times here in Q2. Paulus Stoffels : On your vaccine question, Larry, first, I want to also add to it that neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immunity is important here for -- not just for the response, but also for durability. Our initial data on the Phase I will be available second half of September, which they will be -- become the basis for a Phase III study. And that will start mid to end September, that's the goal. With a large number of people included and a simple design with a single dose, we could have data before the year-end, or at the latest, early next year. And availability of a vaccine will be starting early next year. We'll have some dosages before the year-end which will be used for clinical trials and maybe for other reasons, but the larger quantity will start first quarter of next year. And then in the year, we will deliver up to 1 billion dosage of our vaccine. And all of that is in place. We have the manufacturing sites. We have the filling sites. We have everything what's needed to deliver that 1 billion vaccines and more next year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Thanks for all you guys are doing to fight COVID. I just had a question on -- following up just on the robotics platform. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more detail. It sounded to me that you were redesigning, if I heard you right, the program to integrate the two systems. Could you just provide a little bit more details on that, and just the timing? I just want to make sure I understood the comments in the prepared remarks. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Kristen, this is Alex. First of all, I just want to restate our excitement about the overall digital space. And when we look at the potential of this market currently being less than 5% penetrated. And understandably, that's indicative of some markets in the United States at well over 50% for certain procedures. But on a global basis, we think there's just tremendous growth opportunity. Two, if you just look at the acceleration of technology that we're also seeing, and clearly, that's been the driving force behind our investment, both in Auris, but also our partnership with Verb and Verily. And as we brought those different capabilities, those different technologies together, I think it's actually reinforced the potential and the possibilities that we see in surgery for the future. And I also think it's important to note that we continue to see really good uptake with our Monarch system. We're going to expand the system with multiple specialty applications, with endourology next in line for U.S. approval for the treatment of kidney stones. And that market in itself is about twice the size of where we are today.  We're making good progress even with -- as our teams deal with the COVID-19 situation on the General Surgery robotic platforms, and that's for both Verb and Auris. We think that it clearly enhances not only the capabilities, but our value proposition and our ability long term to really create and launch a differentiated platform.  As Joe, I believe, Chris may have alluded to earlier in their points, we continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. We will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway for the U.S. And after analyzing time to market compared to the overall value proposition, look, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022.  And again, we think there is significant potential. We continue to be impressed by the technology advancements we're seeing with both the Verb and Verily and the Auris combination. Our teams are making very good progress as we speak. And we'll be providing more information as well on our digital, and we'll be providing you some further updates regarding a more focused digital review in the coming months. So stay tuned. But I think we're as excited as ever about the possibility and the potential in this market. Operator : Next question is coming from Matt Miksic with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : So just one clarification on the recovery side, if I could emphasize this one topic, but it sounds like the fourth quarter expectations came down as you're describing a little bit just on the backlog not being as strong, given the strength and recovery that we saw in June. And are your assumptions for the back half and for Q3, Q4 based on sort of the trends exiting June? And Alex, as you point out, we need to watch carefully over the next several weeks. Is that sort of the setup for the back half?  And then maybe, if that does -- if we pause here at all in the next month or 2, is it fair to say that, I guess, are we looking at making up those -- does the backlog go back up and this sort of brings up Q4, Q1? Is that the right sort of way to think about the flow of procedures? And I have one follow-up for Paul in vaccines. Joseph Wolk : So Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it appropriately. So we took down the fourth quarter simply because that pent-up demand or that backlog that we thought would occur from a deferment of procedures in Q2 and Q3 when we issued guidance in April is, quite frankly, not occurring. That's a good thing for certainly patients, but for the health care system, that there's not some unintended consequences with the deferral of very, very important procedures.  The model going forward is based on the best information we had coming out of June. So yes, it would reflect that. And I think that's probably a fair assumption or premise to say that if we had a slowdown here as cases rise in select areas, that, that slowdown would probably be compensated with an improvement to the outlook for Q4, possibly Q1, depending on how long elective procedures are not permitted.  Again, I do want to emphasize that collectively as a society, as a health care system at large, we're much better prepared. And when there are isolation measures that are put in place, it's much more selective than maybe the universal approach we were looking at back at the end of March or early April. So I think it would be less of an impact, but I don't think it's unfair to think that, that impact, if negative, would come back in a positive way at some point later in the future. Alex Gorsky : Matt, this is Alex. I think one other factor that we're going to have to watch closely is also what's happening more broadly with the economy, unemployment and insurance rates and coverage as we head into Q4. And I think, again, the next few weeks and the next couple of months will be very important in determining that, but that's another factor that we're watching. Of course, that's not the case outside the United States. It's over -- about 50% of our business in the U.S., so that's another figure that we're going have to watch closely. Matthew Miksic : And then the follow-up -- that's super helpful color -- and on -- for Paul on vaccines. Just it sounds like the immunogenicity is on track as you're moving into first-in-human studies. I guess it may be too early to answer this question, but any color or thoughts at this point on what level of protection this antibody creation can give us at this point? Or what do we know? And what do you expect to learn maybe over the next several months in terms of actual protection? Paulus Stoffels : Well, in nonhuman primates and in animal models, you can get to a high level of protection. So we -- it's difficult to extrapolate to humans. But typically, we have a good correlation between animal models in all of our experiments with RSV, HIV, Ebola and Zika. So we should expect significantly above 50%. Well, the barrier is for the FDA, I think you should expect 70%, 80%, in that range at least, and that is also the statistics which will go into the studies. So let's hope we reach that because that could create herd immunity and we could hopefully get a stop -- put a stop to the disease. So let's hope for a very good neutralizing antibody level protecting people at a very high level. Operator : Next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : I'll just ask one as a follow-up on the guidance, and thank you for providing that. So just on the fourth quarter guidance for devices, it sounds like the reduction from previous commentary is really just a function, as you said, of better trends in deferred procedures here in Q2 and Q3. I'm curious, does that Q4 guidance that you provided of minus 15% to zero, does that assume a slowdown from current trends due to the spread of COVID in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks? Or are you assuming that your kind of current trends continue? Just want to get a sense for whether you assume, in that 0 to 15%, that things get worse as we go forward or not? Joseph Wolk : Yes. So Bob, I would say that it probably looks at trends the way they were occurring more at the end of June. That's the best data -- official data that we had. So we rely on certainly the IHME model, but also studies that are being done and analytics from UCLA, MIT and various other sources.  As Alex mentioned, the outreach that he's had personally, that Ashley has had personally, and other medical device leaders in our company, to the customers themselves to understand what's going on in the ground is probably the most insightful qualitative analysis we put into our modeling, and that's been extremely helpful. So I would say it's largely based on the trends that we saw at the end of June.  And again, I do want to caution folks that while we are seeing a rise in cases, it is in very select communities, in very select states. So again, it's not that same universal approach. And to the size of the business in Medical Devices, it would have a relatively minor impact, in our thinking, should one of those areas slow down versus what the dynamic was at the end of March and early April. Operator : Your next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : So, my first question is just on this new-to-brand prescription pickup. How much of an improvement have you seen? Are there any metrics that you can provide here? And how will it unfold throughout the rest of the year in your mind? And then second question is, how should we think about how much of your increase in your 2020 financial guidance was already captured or incorporated into the second quarter '20 beat? Joseph Wolk : Joaquin, maybe you want to answer the new to brand? Joaquin Duato : Yes. Thank you. Let me take the new-to-brand data. Overall, what we have seen in both prescriptions and new-to-brand is that they are still below pre-COVID levels, about 9% in overall prescriptions and about 30% in new-to-brand. And I'm talking about market now in general. But what we are seeing is at -- during the quarter, a constant improvement. So, the trends are still improving, and we are seeing particularly positive trends in oncology, where diagnostics visits and IV drug administrations have already returned to the pre-pandemic levels. Joseph Wolk : Thanks, Joaquin. And Louise, with respect to your question about how much has already been captured with the second quarter results. I think if you just look purely at the numbers, a lot of the guidance uptake was dependent upon, at least for top line, on the results of the second quarter, specifically in Medical Devices. From our April guidance, we kind of knocked out the worst-case scenario, if you will. And we also saw a little bit of improvement with currency translation as well. With respect to earnings in the bottom line. As you know, I think coming into the call, at least as of Monday's data, it suggests that we beat by roughly $0.20 per share on the bottom line. We've taken our guidance up operationally $0.10 as we're going to continue to look and challenge our teams for good, solid investments for the balance of this year that fortify 2021 and beyond. And that's kind of how we're thinking of this going forward. Joaquin Duato : Yes. I would also add that, with respect to our own brands, what we are seeing both in immunology and oncology is that we continue to gain share both in total TRxs and in new-to-brand. For example, when you look at STELARA in Crohn's colonic disease, where year-over-year share gain has been 6.8 points. And when you look at our actual share in overall Crohn's disease is 16%, and our new-to-brand share is 17.7%. So, when you look at our share trends both in immunology and in oncology, in total TRxs and in new-to-brand share, in both cases, we see share gains. Christopher DelOrefice : We have time for one more question. Rob, could you introduce the next question, please? Operator : Sure, sure. Your next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : I appreciate the early insights on 2021. But just I might have missed it, but any thoughts on how we should think about margins maybe relative -- I know this year is kind of an outlier, but relative to prior years? And then would welcome your latest perspective on any impact you're seeing with respect to payer mix from elevated unemployment and how this might impact 2021. I know, Alex, you touched on this a little bit, but maybe anything you're seeing at this point and how you're thinking about that right now? Joseph Wolk : So Terence, I'll answer in terms of operating margin first before turning it over to Joaquin for some of the payer mix. In terms of margins, you -- this right -- that' you're absolutely right. This is a year that's a little bit abnormal, to say the least. So we would expect margin improvement off of this year.  I would point to a number of initiatives that we had already in place that should continue to yield better margins, specifically in our consumer unit, where we did have a SKU rationalization program which should be fully executed by the end of this year. That will help improve margins. And then some broader supply chain initiatives that we had with respect to our partnership with Jabil largely in our Medical Device unit.  So, we would anticipate that there would be margin improvement. We're still going to look to prioritize investment in R&D. I think it was a very strong sign for the company that our level of R&D investment in the second quarter of this year was actually slightly higher than what it was last year. Despite the work-from-home dynamic, we continued to progress our pipeline across all three of our businesses. Joaquin Duato : So regarding our payer mix. Just for background, our payer mix now, it's about 50% commercial and about 40% -- 43% Medicare and Medicaid : Medicare being 37%, Medicaid 6%. So a very well-diversified payer mix. At this point, we have not seen any major changes in our payer mix yet. So we have not seen those changes. Depending, as Alex referred before, on the economic recovery and the resulting unemployment rate, we could expect, in the second half of the year, an increase in Medicaid, health exchanges and also uninsured numbers, which will also create affordability problems. But again, at this point, we have not seen changes in our payer mix yet. Christopher DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Joaquin. Appreciate it. Terence, thank you. And as always, thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest. If we weren't able to get to your question at this time, obviously, please reach out to the Investor Relations team. And then I'll just turn it over to Alex now just for a final comment. Alex Gorsky : Well, thank you, Chris. And look, let me end where we started and thank all of you for your ongoing support, and also thank all of our colleagues at Johnson & Johnson who've been working around the clock over the past several quarters to ensure that we can continue to serve all of our credo stakeholders, the patients, the doctors, the surgeons, mothers and fathers that depend on us, that are ensuring that our employees have got a safe environment, the communities where we serve, and ultimately to you, our shareholders.  Hopefully, you also agree that the transparency and the strength of our results in the second quarter reinforce, I think, the core philosophy of Johnson & Johnson, and that in -- whether it be in good times or in challenging times like these, that our strategy, our business model and our value system will ensure that we're able to navigate through in a way that's best for everyone.  So, thank you. We'll -- we're committed to keeping you updated on the progress that we're making in our various programs and as we get more information. And thank you very much, everyone. Stay healthy and stay safe. Bye for now. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson Johnson's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the third quarter of 2020. I hope everyone is healthy and continues to remain safe during these times. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will be joined by Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer Health; and Mathai Mammen, Global Head of Janssen Research & Development.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K, and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will cover consolidated and segment sales information, along with some operational highlights from the P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. My comments on the segments will be shared at a high-level to allow more time for Q&A. Joe will provide high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including J&J's response to COVID-19 followed by insights into our capital allocation priorities as well as some key pipeline updates. He will then conclude with our 2020 guidance, and qualitative expectations as we\u2019re positioned for a strong start to 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.  Worldwide sales were $21.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020, reflecting a reported growth of 1.7% versus the third quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, also increased 1.7% as currency had no impact in the quarter. In the U.S., sales increased 2.7%; while in regions outside the U.S., our reported and operational increase was 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales increase was 2% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S., and 1.1% outside the U.S. Results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did see improvement throughout the quarter with procedure volume recovering faster than expected as well as positive trends in scripts and physician office visits.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.66 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.20, representing increases of 3.5% and 3.8% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 2.4%.  Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the third quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2019, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and grew 3% with growth in the U.S. of 11.6% and a decline outside the U.S. of 2.7%. Consumer Health delivered strong performance in our U.S. OTC, oral care, and wound care businesses, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 outside the U.S. primarily in our OTC, and skin health/beauty businesses. We're making good progress executing our SKU rationalization program, which as expected, negatively impacted sales results in mostly OUS markets. However, this was mostly offset by some sales related true-ups in Latin America. Additionally, e-commerce sales continue to drive growth across most brands. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally by 4% on strong U.S. sales of TYLENOL in analgesics due to share growth and increased demand driven by COVID-19, PEPCID in digestive health due to a competitive withdrawal, and ZYRTEC in allergy due to the share gains, incremental distribution, and strong in-season marketing plans. Growth was also driven by increased retailer stocking across multiple brands in preparation for a potential upcoming cold and flu season. This strong performance was partially offset outside the U.S. by the impact of COVID-19 consumption declines in China in pain, and in cough, cold, and digestive health in other regions.  Our OTC business is growing above the market gaining 0.7 points of share on a year-to-date basis. The skin health/beauty franchise returned to growth of 0.9% on strong performance of OGX due to share gains coupled with increased retailer stocking across multiple brands and a reduction in sun care returns due to a rebound in category growth. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. and the negative impact of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific and Latin America. As consumers continued to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, oral care grew by 10.8% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new product launches in Asia Pacific and increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound care grew 13.5%, primarily due to strong sales of BAND-AID Brand Adhesive Bandages, and NEOSPORIN. Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $11.4 billion grew 4.6% enabled by growth across all regions. The business realized double-digit growth in seven key products with oncology as the main catalyst. Sales grew in the U.S. by 1.5% and outside the U.S. by 8.8%. Our growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19, driven by continued delays in diagnosis and slower new patient starts. The products most impacted were STELARA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, and our pulmonary hypertension portfolio. The estimated impact of these products was worth roughly 200 basis points on worldwide pharmaceuticals growth in the quarter, which was an improvement from Q2 as office visit and script trends continue to improve. Year-to-date global operational growth was strong at roughly 6%, which remains above expected market growth for 2020. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 12.4%. DARZALEX continued to show momentum in all regions growing 43.4% led by share uptake in lines 1 and 2, with U.S. line 1 share up 2 points versus the prior year. Additionally, the U.S. and European markets exhibited increasing adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation, especially during this pandemic period. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the U.S. filing for amyloidosis. IMBRUVICA grew 11.2% globally driven largely by increased penetration and share gains in Europe. U.S. saw a strong underlying double-digit growth and continued leadership and share growth in CLL line 1, up 1.9 points. U.S. growth was negatively impacted by two comparisons to the prior year, a one-time returns reserve adjustment and higher inventory levels in 2019. On a global basis, these adjustments were worth over 500 basis points. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum contributing just over $200 million in the quarter with sales more than doubling versus prior year with strong share growth, especially in the metastatic indication. Slightly offsetting these results were declines in ZYTIGA and VELCADE, primarily due to generic competition.  Moving now to immunology, globally sales grew 1.9% in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in STELARA and TREMFYA partially offset by continued erosion in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. Internationally, sales grew at 8.4% offsetting a slight decline in the U.S. of under 1%. Third quarter growth for our immunology portfolio as well as the overall market was impacted by COVID-19 related delayed diagnosis. Year-to-date, immunology growth was 5.7%. STELARA growth of 14% was driven by continued global uptake and share gains in Crohn's Disease, with about a 5 point share increase in the U.S. and growth from the recently approved ulcerative colitis indication, despite the negative impacts to the immunology market created by COVID-19. On a year-to-date basis, STELARA growth remained strong at about 18% globally.  TREMFYA, the first-in-class market leading IL-23 inhibitor grew 12.2% in the quarter, driven by growth of roughly 50% outside the U.S., due to continued strength of new launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales were flat in the quarter. U.S. delivered strong share gains, up nearly 3 points. However, growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 along with an unfavorable prior period pricing adjustment and further investments in rebates offered to enhance access. On a year-to-date basis, global growth for TREMFYA remained strong at 30.3%. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio posted double-digit growth of 13.9% driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of 12.3% and 23.2% respectively, driven by increased market penetration and share growth. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.2 billion declining 3.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 3.3% worldwide. The medical device market continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Q3 but procedures began to resume more widely across the globe and we\u2019re reporting significant improvement in sales versus the 32.5% adjusted operational decline in Q2 and 20.1% decline in June. There was some variability by platform and across markets, but overall, we saw more stable results in total across each month this quarter with September declining in line with the total quarter declines of 3.3%. The sequential improvement compared to Q2 occurred across all segments of our business with the recovery occurring the quickest in the U.S. and China, two of our largest geographies. The U.S. returned to growth in the quarter. China grew almost 17% adjusting for the ASP divestiture despite the negative impact from the sell-through of product stocking that occurred in the first quarter to ensure there was product available to support the expected market recovery in subsequent quarters. We expect most of this product stocking to be depleted in Q4. Most other OUS markets experienced significant improvements compared to Q2. However, the state of procedure recovery has varied by market due to factors such as the structure of different healthcare systems, and localized decisions regarding COVID-19 restrictions. Consistent with what we shared in the prior quarter, the impact to results related to selling days was immaterial for this quarter. As a reminder, we will have extra selling days in the fourth quarter as a result of the 53rd week. Interventional solutions returned to double-digit growth this quarter across both the U.S. and OUS regions delivering 12.4% growth globally. The U.S. and China were the primary drivers with newer product offerings in both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS, positively contributing to both market and share growth for the quarter. Additionally, we received approval from the U.S. FDA for our THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Ablation Catheter for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation making it the only radio frequency catheter on the U.S. market with this indication. Worldwide orthopaedics declined 3.1% versus prior year, with the U.S. returning to growth for the quarter. Hips grew 1.9% globally led by strong us growth of 8.7%. This reflects both market recovery, as well as strength from our leadership position in the U.S. in the anterior approach and related demand for products like the ACTIS total hip system and enabling technologies.  Sales outside the U.S. declined by 8.4% due to COVID-19, as well as product stocking reductions in China worth over 250 basis points. Worldwide trauma returned to growth in Q3 delivering 0.7% growth globally. U.S. growth of 4.2% for the quarter reflects COVID-19 related procedural recovery, as well as continued strength of our newer products, such as the Femoral Neck Systems, and Cannulated Compression Screws. OUS declines reflect slower procedure volumes due to COVID-19. We continue to see stabilization of our spine business with recent launches of SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT. Global results for this platform were flat versus prior year. The knee market accelerated versus Q2 performance, but is recovering slower than the other segments of orthopaedics. The U.S. recovery was better than other markets declining about 2% primarily driven by COVID-19. Performance was aided by the continued success of products like ATTUNE Revision and Cementless. While improving from a Q2 decline of 55.3%, Q3 OUS sales decline of 26.4% reflects slower market recovery, especially in revision procedures where we have higher penetration than primary. Performance was also negatively impacted by a comparison to strong double-digit adjusted growth in the third quarter of 2019. Pricing continues to be a factor in orthopaedics. For the quarter, U.S. price returned to more historic levels, down low single-digits. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery showed significant improvement versus Q2, but still declined by 1.2% due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide energy and endocutters declined about 7% and 3%, respectively. We continue to experience competitive pressures in the U.S. However, relative to the market, both platforms performed well outside the U.S., especially in China due to the strength of new products. Global biosurgery increased over 5%, reflecting share gains from new products and the return of SURGIFLO plus thrombin to the U.S. market after the supply disruption in the prior year. Last year's supply disruption impacted biosurgery growth by about 400 basis points in the quarter. Global wound closure declined less than 5%, in line with the market recovery with continued competitive growth in both the U.S. and China. The vision business declined 9.5% globally. U.S. contact lens growth of about 13% was largely driven by product stocking worth about 11 points, which is expected to return to more normalized levels in Q4. OUS contact lens improved versus the prior quarter. The decline of 18% was negatively impacted by a prior year prebuy in advance of consumption tax increase in Japan worth about 5 points. We continue to advance our contact lens pipeline with the world's first and only drug releasing contact lens for patients with allergic eye itch having received approval from Health Canada for ACUVUE Theravision. Surgical vision declined 16.4% globally due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures and competitive pressures in U.S. I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see that we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.20 reflects a reported increase of 3.8% and an operational increase of 2.4%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold remained flat versus 2019 as a percent of sales as COVID-19-related fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business was offset by favorable mix in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceuticals business, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales and increased brand marketing expense investments in the Consumer business.  We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 13.5% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the third quarter of 2019 by 100 basis points driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, increased investment in robotics and digital platforms, and the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $4.2 billion last year. 2019 includes $4 billion related to the initial agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and we've recorded an additional $1 billion in the third quarter of 2020 based on continued negotiations of an all-in settlement amount for the state, local and tribal governments opioid litigation claims for a cumulative total of $5 billion. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased from a 6.4% benefit in the third quarter of 2019 to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, the third quarter 2019 tax rate was significantly affected by the aforementioned $4 billion agreement in principle. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19% versus 20.3% in the same period last year.  Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise increased by 0.1% versus the third quarter of 2019 to 34.4%. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 340 basis points to 46.4% primarily driven by favorable product mix, and selling and marketing expense leveraging. Medical Devices declined to 21.6% driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including sales declines and fixed cost deleveraging. Consumer Health margins improved by 280 basis points to 24.4% driven by favorable product mix, inclusive of progressing our SKU rationalization program. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks all of you for joining us today. 2020 has proven to be an eventful year with uncertainty sparking rapid change across many industries, particularly in healthcare. I'm honored to represent Johnson & Johnson management to acknowledge the tremendous resilience and the willingness of our colleagues across the globe to tackle the many challenges being encountered. Like in prior quarters, and for that matter, prior years, their strength, character and perseverance is the driving force behind our solid performance this quarter, while solidifying the foundation for long-term success across Johnson & Johnson's businesses. Our team continues to be hard at work pursuing a vaccine candidate to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are proud of the progress that has been made thus far. On September 23, we announced that the first participants were dosed in our pivotal multi-country Phase 3 trial ENSEMBLE, which will evaluate a single dose of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate in up to 60,000 people worldwide, including representation from high-risk populations and underrepresented communities. This follows positive interim results from our Phase 1/2a study, which showed the safety profile and immunogenicity after a single vaccination with our candidates supported for the development. These findings demonstrated that a single dose resulted in immunogenicity in all age groups with similar responses, including older adults. A single dose of a safe and effective vaccine could offer a significant advantage during a global pandemic. We also appreciate that a 2-dose regimen may have the potential for enhanced durability in some participants. Therefore, we plan to run a Phase 3 clinical trial with a 2-dose regimen beginning later this year. Simultaneously, we have scaled up manufacturing capacity and are on track to meet our goal of providing over 1 billion doses of a vaccine per year. We have committed to the public to provide the vaccine once approved on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. As we continue to progress our vaccine clinical program, we are committed to the highest ethical standards, sound scientific principles, pursuit of diversity and inclusion, and transparent communication of our processes and results. Let me be unequivocal here. We have not encountered any undue pressure, and we will maintain the rigorous requirements of research, development and manufacturing to bring a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to the public as we do for all our products. Mathai Mammen will provide a few words on the COVID-19 vaccine candidate at the conclusion of my remarks. Now let's take a deeper look into our results and outlook. Each of our business segments performed well in the third quarter despite COVID-19-related headwinds. We believe our Pharmaceutical segment once again outperformed the market, recovery in our Medical Device business was faster than anticipated. And in Consumer, our strategy focused on science-based products led to solid growth. While COVID dynamics continue to make the outlook fluid and perhaps not linear, we are encouraged by this progress and believe that we will continue to see improvement through the end of the year. As Chris mentioned in his remarks with respect to the additional accrual for opioid litigation, the amount crewed this quarter is intended to bring a comprehensive resolution to the overall opioid litigation with states, cities, counties and tribal governments for a final amount and provide certainty for involved parties and critical assistance for families and communities in need. Regarding our cash position, we ended the third quarter with approximately $7 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $38 billion of debt. Our balance sheet remains strong. We estimate free cash flow through the first 3 quarters to be more than $13 billion. In August, the company completed a $7.5 billion debt offering. We were able to secure historically low rates benefiting from the current low interest rate environment and our strong credit rating. Subsequent to the quarter, approximately $6.5 billion was used to fund our recently closed acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals. Our capital allocation strategy remains intact, committed to managing our entire business and portfolio with a long-term mindset. While all aspects of our COVID-19 vaccine program are a top priority, we continue to invest in innovation in key areas of our pipeline across all parts of our business.  With respect to M&A, we continue to evaluate potential strategic opportunities that complement the robust R&D portfolio across our broad-based business while driving long-term value for our stakeholders. As I just noted earlier this month, we closed the Momenta Pharmaceuticals transaction, bolstering our pipeline with novel therapeutics being developed for immune-mediated diseases. We are particularly excited by the lead asset, nipocalimab, a potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. The science behind nipocalimab is advancing research in rare autoantibody-driven diseases with significant unmet need with current Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic diseases of the fetus and newborn, and myasthenia gravis. We plan to build on this foundation with additional indications planned in serious dermatological, rheumatic, neurologic and hematologic diseases. Many of these autoantibody diseases have no adequate standard-of-care today. Finally, on capital allocation, our dividend remains a top priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders, in line with the 6.3% increase we announced in April. We continue to make progress advancing key pipeline assets that are expected to deliver long-term growth. Beyond what Chris mentioned in his remarks, there are a few other pipeline items worth highlighting. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline. During the third quarter, we received FDA approval for a second indication of SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. We did make a strategic decision to discontinue development of Pimodivir, an investigational treatment for Influenza A, based on recent results from pre-planned interim analysis that found Pimodivir in combination with the standard-of-care did not demonstrate added benefit in hospitalized patients. As we head into the fourth quarter, we look forward to additional planned submissions, most notably our U.S. filing of our BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma as well as the U.S. filing for amivantamab in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding digital robotic surgery in our Medical Device business, we made a significant step for our orthopaedic solution, submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the U.S. FDA in September for our VELYS robotic-assisted solutions for total knee arthroplasty. This is another important milestone in our digital surgery program, complementing the commercial success we have seen with Monarch. As you may recall, we planned a full Medical Device business review back in May and I hoped we could provide that in-person event sometime this year. However, given the ongoing limitations for in-person events, we decided to provide a shorter, limited scope virtual update on our Medical Device business featuring all of our digital surgery solutions. We scheduled this for Thursday, November 19, and we'll provide additional event details in the coming weeks. So let's now turn to our full year 2020 guidance and key updates. As I noted, based on our third quarter results across the enterprise and the continued progress we saw in procedure volumes, we are confident to increase our guidance. To provide you a little more insights regarding our Medical Devices business, as you can see from our results, we exceeded our expectations as the market recovery was even stronger-than-anticipated as hospital and surgeons continue to work through the pent-up demand resulting from restrictions on procedures earlier in the year. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are expecting continued procedure stabilization slightly ahead of our assumptions communicated last quarter. We are updating our range to be flat to down 10% versus flat to down 15% provided last quarter. As a reminder, this range is compared with our original estimates to start the year when we were expecting to continue our positive sales momentum prior to the pandemic. This updated range reflects continued improvement with fourth quarter sales expectations around 2019 levels. This forecast reflects our latest thinking based on what we know today and is consistent with our efforts throughout the year to provide transparency around our assumptions. Taking the qualitative factors related to each of our segments into account, and based on recent developments, we are making the following adjustments to our 2020 guidance : Adjusted operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $82 billion to $82.8 billion or flat to growth of 1% versus 2019. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.17, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points versus the negative 130 basis points provided in our July guidance or an improvement of 30 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales change between minus 1% to flat compared to 2019 or $81.2 billion to $82 billion. We are expecting our operating margins to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 100 basis points decline with planned investments across all of our business segments in the fourth quarter. We are tightening our other income guidance to $800 million to $900 million versus our previous guidance of $800 million to $1 billion. We are tightening the range of net interest expense, now expected to be net interest expense of $100 million to $150 million. We are also tightening the range of our effective tax rate guidance for 2020, estimated at 17.0% to 17.5%. Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.95 and to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our July guidance and now reflects no translational currency impact for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.95 to $8.05 or a range of minus 8.4% to minus 7.3%. In case you're now doing a double take, yes, that is the same range I just provided for constant currency. So essentially, on income, we are estimating no year-on-year impact from currency. While not providing guidance related to 2021 at this time, I'd like to provide some early perspectives on how we are thinking about next year for consideration in your financial modeling. We anticipate our Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, continuing to reach more patients with best-in-class products in areas of high unmet need. As such, we expect to continue delivering solid volume-driven above market growth in 2021.  In Consumer Health, we expect to grow competitively with the market, driven by priority areas and enhanced strength in e-commerce. We expect that continued SKU rationalization and 2020 COVID-related sales comparisons, primarily in OTC, can be a headwind in the first half of 2021.  With respect to margins, we have demonstrated a steady cadence of margin improvement. Our previously announced SKU rationalization will result in margin improvement. But given the tremendous progress the team has made in recent years to reach benchmark levels, the improvement will not be as significant as we've experienced the last [few] years. In our Medical Devices segment, we anticipate a continued increase in procedures associated with pandemic recovery. We continue to believe in the strong underlying fundamentals in the medical device market, such as aging demographics and unmet need, coupled with hospital systems that have successfully navigated the pandemic. As I said on our second quarter earnings call, hospitals are much better prepared for any potential COVID resurgence that become even more efficient in the allocation of resources to meet the needs of all patients. While we certainly continue to watch closely as the rest of 2020 plays out, we remain optimistic heading into 2021. And as you might expect, anticipate to deliver robust double-digit sales growth. Moving on to a few comments related to the 2021 P&L. Consistent with sales, we also anticipate strong comparative year-over-year earnings per share. This is in part due to the 2020 dynamics but also in part due to the strength of our businesses. At this time, we anticipate that operating margin will be more in the range of where we ended 2019. For R&D, we will continue to invest for the long-term and anticipate that level of spend to be in the same range of approximately 14% of sales, consistent with prior years. Lastly, it's important to note that we are committed to the incremental investment necessary to advance our pipeline, inclusive of the negative impact to EPS related to the Momenta acquisition, and that in 2021, the impact to EPS is approximately dilution of $0.10 to $0.15 as we disclosed at the deal signing. We remain confident in our strength heading into 2021 and optimistic in our long-term outlook. I want to thank the business leaders joining our call today, Jennifer, Ashley, Thibaut and Mathai to engage in the Q&A session. In fact, I'm going to take the liberty of kicking off this portion of the webcast with the topic that we are often asked, that being the impact of COVID-19, not only this year but what we anticipate for 2021 by requesting each of these leaders to provide a few brief comments on their respective businesses. And then we'll have Mathai address the state of our vaccine candidate development. Jennifer, let's start with you. Jennifer Taubert : Well, thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It's really nice to have the opportunity to speak with you today. I'd like to start by acknowledging all those who have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. I sincerely hope that you and those closest to you, remain healthy and safe. I'm really proud of the Pharmaceuticals group performance in the third quarter. We know that illnesses don't hit pause just because there's a global pandemic. So whether battling cancer, facing mental health challenges or living with an autoimmune disease, patients rely on our transformational medicines every single day. As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business grew 4.6% operationally in the third quarter, and we delivered our 10th consecutive quarter with sales that exceeded $10 billion and our second quarter with sales exceeding $11 billion. 7 of our key brands grew at double-digit rates, including our oncology brands, ERLEADA, DARZALEX and IMBRUVICA; our immunology brands, STELARA and TREMFYA; and our pulmonary hypertension brands OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And despite the pressures that COVID-19 placed on our business, our growth year-to-date is roughly 6%, definitely above market growth. During the third quarter, we kept a relentless focus on innovation and on delivering for our patients and customers around the world. So we worked really hard to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio of marketed medicines. We delivered on our pipeline of transformational medicines, and we advanced our next wave of innovation. In Q3, we continued the very successful launch of DARZALEX FASPRO, which is our subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX to treat multiple myeloma and we received approvals for SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. And we filed UPTRAVI IV for pulmonary arterial hypertension and DARZALEX for light chain amyloidosis. And on October 1, we closed our acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, which provides a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth through expansion into and leadership in autoantibody-driven diseases. 2020 has been an unprecedented year, and we've adapted our business to meet the new challenges that have been posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We quickly transitioned to scaling omni-channel capabilities to engage with healthcare providers. We enabled patients to both start and stay on therapy using virtual tools and we deployed a number of technologies to help keep our clinical trials on track. And despite some negative impact related to COVID-19 in the quarter, we also saw encouraging signs of recovery in our market performance across multiple metrics. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, and we feel confident in our ability to grow above the market on a full year basis in 2020. And also our expectations of where our business is heading remain unchanged, and we continue to plan for another strong year of above market growth in 2021.  So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today, and I look forward to any questions. But first, let me go ahead and turn it over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley? Ashley McEvoy : Thank you, Jennifer. Well, listen, clearly, the Med Dev market has been disrupted by this once in a generation event. And I, too, would like to start by acknowledging that this recovery would not be possible without the heroic efforts of healthcare workers around the world. Their selfless dedication to patient care has just been amazing. And I must give a shout out to our J&Jers who since day 1 in Wuhan have been partnering with our customers, covering cases, managing both COVID-19 patients as well as helping to stand back up other important medical procedures. So as Jennifer mentioned, COVID has really been an accelerant for shifts within the med tech industry, really creating a lot of new creative solutions related to digital patient engagement, virtual surgeon training, a shift in sites of care and continued evolution in our business models. We've risen to this challenge in rethinking how we engage with our customers. To name a couple of examples, we partnered with an education partner, Advances in Surgery, where we virtually trained over 1 million surgeons in 150 different countries on COVID-19 protocols as well as ways to safely stand back up medical procedures. We've incorporated remote clinical case support to assist and connect customers around the world. And most recently, in September, we launched resources to educate patients about the importance of routine medical visits and the implications of deferring treatment with the My Health Can't Wait campaign. During the pandemic, we meaningfully advanced our innovation agenda. We continue to increase the overall value of our new product pipeline and are shifting to more substantial and transformational innovation. In quarter 3, we received FDA approval for the indication to treat persistent atrial fibrillation in our Biosense Webster business. We were granted approval from Health Canada for a first of its kind drug-eluting contact lens for allergy sufferers. We submitted our FDA filing for our upcoming VELYS robotic-assisted knee replacement program. We received FDA clearance for our dual mobility hip, a high growth segment. And lastly, we've begun a rollout of an entire revamp of our Ethicon Endocutter ECHELON platform from [budgeted] to powered circular staplers to improve stapling mechanisms, all to reduce leaks and improve outcomes. So as we've been talking about med tech, really, we've been on this 3-year improvement journey, and we are demonstrating progress with growth year-over-year from 1.5% in 2017 to 3.9% in 2019. While COVID temporarily interrupted this progression, our results this quarter demonstrate that in addition to the overall market recovery, the strategic choices we've made to strengthen our competitiveness and our relentless focus on customers and patients are working. It's good to see our largest market, United States grow positive, up 1% growth. Our second largest market, China, delivered 17% growth and platforms like Biosense Webster and CERENOVUS grew double-digits. And hip, trauma and biosurgery, all posted low to mid-single-digit growth. So looking forward, there's still going to be factors like patient willingness and affordability of medical care, which will continue to drive some level of uncertainty in the near term. However, when I look at the end markets overall in med tech, I continue to be optimistic as there's still unmet clinical need to be met. So knowing what we know today with the impact of COVID and what it had on 2020, I expect that we're going to deliver robust double-digit operational growth in 2021. Thanks for your time. Looking forward to the questions. And now I'm going to turn it over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Ashley, and good morning to all of you on the call. As you heard from Chris, this quarter, again, we have seen that our consumer brands have been very resilient during this unprecedented time. Our Consumer Health sector grew at 33% operationally in the quarter, delivering a 3.4% operational growth on a year-to-date basis, while continuing to expand our margins and this is a testament to the strength of strategy of offering differentiated science-based brands focused on personal health and those by professionals. So in today's environment, consumers globally have heightened interest in personal health and hygiene, and it's driving high demand for efficacious trusted solutions backed by science, like those offered by Johnson & Johnson. And an example of that preference would be the tremendous growth we have seen in our over-the-counter medicine business driven by brands like TYLENOL, ZYRTEC, PEPCID and ZARBEE\u2019S, or in our oral care franchise with LISTERINE mouthwash. In other parts of our business like skin health and beauty, results have been more nuanced. We have seen a negative impact of COVID-19 in categories like sun care and makeup removers, while seeing increased demand for body wash, body lotions or premium hair care. So for 2021, we expect both headwinds and tailwinds as we saw this year. But we strongly believe that our strategy, our capabilities and our focus on execution position us very well for continued performance. We are prepared to see ongoing fluctuation in consumer demand related to the pandemic, potential pantry loading behaviors or lower incidence of conditions like cold and flu. However, even with these uncertainties in mind, we expect to see continued strong growth in e-commerce and continued demand for our leading brands with efficacy is backed by science, resulting in our Consumer Health business to continue to grow competitively with the market in 2021. And with this, let me hand over to Mathai Mammen. Mathai Mammen : Thank you, Thibaut. Let me now give you a brief update on our COVID-19 vaccine. First, a reminder of a bit of background. On the heels of some really promising Phase 1 and 2a data, we initiated a single dose Phase 3 study called ENSEMBLE a few weeks ago on September 21 in the United States, and we're in the process of opening numerous sites globally. Our vaccine, as a reminder, is based on Ad26. This is a human adenovirus and contains a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our vaccine was shown to elicit a robust immune response in humans as demonstrated by the presence of neutralizing antibodies in T cells. I'd like to now elaborate on the statement we posted on our website yesterday regarding a temporary pause in further dosing in our COVID vaccine clinical trials. First, some context. It's not at all unusual for unexpected illnesses that occur in large studies over their duration. In some cases, they\u2019re called serious adverse events or SAEs, and may have something or nothing to do with the drug or vaccine being investigated. However, as a company that always puts safety first, we take each and every case seriously. In certain cases, when we need more information, we pause the enrollment and dosing of additional participants as we take the time to gather more information. We have a very defined and well thought due process at J&J that follows high standards of scientific, medical and ethical factors, and we followed all of that to the letters here. First, preliminary information is sent to an independent data and safety monitoring board or DSMB. DSMB, as you know, are very commonly part of trials in the pharmaceutical industry. This board is comprised of outside experts who evaluate the information and then make a recommendation to us. In our case here, we were informed of an unexpected illness on Sunday evening October 11, and we followed our process exactly and quickly and posted a statement on our website the following day on Monday, October 12 pausing enrollment. The DSMB was informed immediately on Sunday, and they've requested additional information. We're now awaiting further medical information and evaluation, which we will then forward to the DSMB for their independent recommendation. We're absolutely committed to providing transparent updates throughout our vaccine development program, and we will update you when we lean more. And finally, I'd like -- I would be remiss if I didn't express great enthusiasm for the R&D portfolio at Janssen. I'm very excited with all the really tremendous progress we made against the programs in our portfolio in spite of COVID-19, continue to make deep investments and terrific progress on currently marketed products to extend them further and against new molecular entities. Highlights were already mentioned that include DARZALEX FASPRO for AL amyloidosis, progress as we continue to build on TREMFYA, amivantamab, our CD3 redirector franchise, BCMA CAR-T, RPGR gene therapy and many others. So happy to address any of that in the Q&A. I'll hand it now back to Chris DelOrefice. Chris? Chris DelOrefice : Terrific. Thank you, Mathai. And thank you, Jennifer, Ashley and Thibaut. Rob, let's now move to questions from the investment community. Can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Mathai, maybe I'll start with you just as we finished with you. Is there a realistic timeframe for us to learn if the adverse event was in the treatment or placebo arm? And any sense right now if the AE was neurological in nature? Mathai Mammen : So, we know very little information right now. We've given our information set that we do know to the DSMB, and they've asked a number of specific questions. We don't know whether they haven't informed us. They have the right to unblind. We are still blinded. So we don't know treatment arm, vaccine arm. We know very little at this point. And it will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And I'll just ask my other two questions right upfront, maybe one for Ashley and one for Joe. Ashley, just thinking about the MDD commentary for September, which suggested improvement but some arresting of improvement in the month of September. As I think about guidance range at the top end, you basically get to do the top end of your range for the fourth quarter to show improvement in the fourth quarter. So what is your confidence in delivering the top end of the range? And what are some of the factors in the fourth quarter that could impact the ability to show sequential improvement? And then for Joe, just quickly on pharma. Thanks for the outlook for '21. Pharma has accelerated the entire year on both the reported and underlying basis, obviously, above market next year. Can pharma accelerate in '21? Ashley McEvoy : So thanks for the question, David. Maybe I'll start with really -- obviously, we ended Q3 down 3%. As Joe mentioned, our expectations for quarter 4, they're really in line with the range communicated in July. We've tightened it a bit to make it from flat to down 10%. And just as a reminder, this is a guide versus what we originally communicated in the beginning of the year in January of our plan. So if you look at this, it means that our range for quarter 4 could be consistent with the results we delivered in quarter 3, a kind of one-bookend to then delivering some modest growth versus 2019 last year. And things that we're considering, I do think that we're confident in how hospitals are managing through the surges. We are paying close attention to patient sentiment and affordability. And at J&J, I believe, Chris mentioned, we did have -- we are bleeding through some inventory that we procured truly in the beginning of the year for China. And we will be also adjusting from, as Chris mentioned, coming off of last year the Japan consumption tax. So those are two things to consider, one from this year and one from last year. Joe Wolk : And David, with respect to Pharmaceuticals, I do think that we could see acceleration. So, the in-line portfolio continues to perform extremely well as we've seen. We're getting nice uptake in some of our larger products, notably STELARA in UC, which was recently an approval we acquired, TREMFYA for PSA. I would also point to some of the filings that we anticipate here in the near-term with respect to the CAR-T BCMA as well as amivantamab for non-small cell lung cancer, potentially on the horizon and part of the mix in 2021. I will also point out that while this quarter was strong, we still have some impact in all three segments related to COVID-19 dynamics. So, there's probably 2 to 3 points of growth that hampered the third quarter reported results. As you can imagine, there's still a segment of the population that's a little bit cautious about going out in public, having their normal office visits. So, I would anticipate that should come back as therapeutics, as vaccines, as people know more about the virus itself. So, it wouldn't be beyond our expectation to think that Jennifer and her team could do even better in 2021. Chris DelOrefice : Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : The first one was just a bit of a clarification on the 2021 operating margin dynamics. I just want to make sure I understood what levels you're referring to with results in line with 2019 margins, specifically. Is that including or excluding the ASP gain last year? And as I think about \u201821 margins, would you characterize those as normalized margins for J&J or are these still margins that are going to be depressed as we're facing some COVID disruptions? My second question was just on pharma pricing, and how you're thinking about that for '21. I guess, specifically, as we think about higher unemployment rates and adverse payer mix, is there any expectation we should be thinking about pricing at all different in '21 versus what we're seeing in 2020? Joe Wolk : Chris, thanks for the questions. I'll take the first question around margins, and then I'll turn it over to Jennifer to give some thoughts with respect to an outlook to the extent we can provide on pharmaceutical pricing. So, with margins, in my commentary, I referenced, we should be around 2019 operating margin levels, that would exclude other income. So, it would exclude the ASP divestiture gain that you've referenced. Our operating margin for 2019 was 31.3%. We expect to get back to that level. We're going to continue to invest in our pipeline. Recall, too, that in our projections for 2021, we're looking at the Momenta transaction, which was dilutive by as much as $0.15. So that's part of the mix. But I would say, Chris, to probably best labelled, if I was to label them as normal operating margins, we expect to grow our bottom line slightly faster than our top line in most years. And so, I think we'll continue to look to do that with respect to the portfolio and our investment capacity, but not compromising the long-term at any point in time. Jennifer Taubert : Chris, it's Jennifer. I can jump in on the pricing one. So, whether it's based on unemployment trends or whether it's based on healthcare reform, we do see that there is going to be continued pressure on pricing across the pharma industry. I think an important reminder is that for us, our growth is all based on volume, not price. So, we think relative to our competitive set, that we are very well positioned for this future environment. We work very, very hard to develop robust value propositions and to be able to get appropriate value for our products in the market, and we'll continue to do so. But whether it's through healthcare reform efforts, which actually we think could ultimately have a positive if it can help lower patient out-of-pocket costs or through other channel mix and dynamics, we do think that there will be continued pressure there. Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Chris, appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : One for Ashley, one for Jennifer. Ashley, I appreciate the commentary about 2021, you expect double-digit growth. My question is, can you grow in 2021 over 2020 -- 2019 levels in the device business. And for Jennifer, you have the SUSTENNA bench trial starting this week. Can you offer any thoughts on that? Do you still believe it will be very difficult for a generic company to manufacture a generic version of SUSTENNA even if you lose that litigation? Ashley McEvoy : Thank you, Larry. So listen, for 2021, we do anticipate, as I mentioned, double-digit growth versus 2020. And we do anticipate growth in 2021 relative to where we exited 2019. Jennifer Taubert : And then if we talk about INVEGA SUSTENNA, we are very confident in our IP positions around our long-acting injectable portfolio, whether we're talking about INVEGA SUSTENNA, whether we're talking about INVEGA TRINZA, those products bring significant benefit to patients with schizophrenia. And so Larry, as you noted, we do have the bench trial that's starting, but that we feel good in our position there and that those assets are going to continue to be able to deliver not only for patients with schizophrenia, but also for Janssen and for Johnson & Johnson. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : First question for Ashley. I was hoping -- just thanks for the 2021 outlook on the Medical Devices franchise, but I was hoping you could help us think through the risk the Affordable Care Act being repealed by the Trump administration? And then secondarily, if unemployment levels stay where they are, what type of headwinds you expect in 2021 and whether those have been baked into that 2021 outlook? And then I was also hoping for Jennifer to ask about the immunology franchise just by revenue it\u2019s been largest business in pharma, seems like bolstering it through the Momenta acquisition. But wanted to ask about any updates you can provide on the outlook for REMICADE declines with the premise being just if that anchor can get lighter, declines can be tempered, that would be a positive for that immunology franchise in 2021 and beyond. But any help you can give on the outlook for REMICADE from here? Ashley McEvoy : Well, thank you, Josh. I think your question was about the ACA. And in our business for J&J Med Device, we have about 60% of our payer mix as public. Clearly, a big chunk of that is Medicare and then the smaller amount of Medicaid and about 40% private. So we do anticipate Medicaid increasing its amount, and we do anticipate given employment and some of the economic challenges that, that private amount may decrease a bit. So we\u2019ve factored those into our considerations when you look at 2021. And then I think your second question was really around patient sentiment. And I would tell you that, that's fast-evolving data that we look at weekly and monthly. And we are always looking to how do we replenish that funnel, and we've factored those considerations into our assumptions into 2021. Jennifer Taubert : Yes. And then it's Jennifer. I'll jump in on the immunology front. So immunology, as you know, is our largest business for the Janssen franchise and continues to deliver very, very strong growth. And both STELARA and TREMFYA delivered very solid quarters. STELARA is showing very significant gains globally in both Crohn's Disease and in the ulcerative colitis launch. And very importantly, just this week, we have 5-year long-term remission data in Crohn's Disease that is actually being presented publicly, which we think is another great catalyst and demonstration of the significant benefits that STELARA offers to patients in the GI space. From a TREMFYA perspective, we've got very strong growth and competitiveness as we continue to launch into not only psoriasis, but now also psoriatic arthritis, which we think is going to be a great catalyst, not only for psoriatic arthritis, but also for the psoriasis business. And right now with TREMFYA, we're the only IL-23 that has that psoriatic arthritis indication and hopefully, as you know, we're also studying it for GI applications and our Crohn's Phase 2 data was actually presented this week as well at the United European Gastroenterology Week. So using our IL-23 pathway strategy, we're not only developing TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but also taking it into the GI space where we believe that we're going to be able to benefit even more patients because there's still so much unmet medical need there. Now you've referenced Momenta, and we were really excited to both announce that deal and to close that deal in a very short timeframe. And that acquisition is going to give us the opportunity to enter into the autoantibody space, where we believe for nipocalimab, we've got as many as 10 or more indications that we're going to be able to go into to really transform autoantibody-related diseases. And just about all of these are very underserved, in many cases, we'll be able to be first-in-class, and we believe, best-in-class, and we think this is going to be a really significant catalyst for us. We've also got a number of other assets in the immunology portfolio, the one we brought in bermekimab from XBiotech. We've got other novel mechanisms that are being developed in GI applications, and we'll look forward to really unveiling the true breadth of our immunology pipeline when we have our Analyst Day in 2021. But so let me come back to your question on REMICADE. REMICADE, I think we can anticipate continued relatively similar declines going forward as that product is very, very late in its life cycle. But please know across the breadth of our immunology portfolio, we have got a ton of strength there and are really planning on continuing -- having that be one of our leading franchises for the Janssen business globally. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it. Rob, next question please? Operator : Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Ashley, this is a question for you. And I guess I'm curious, you gave a lot of color, I appreciate that. So I just want to get a little bit deeper. And I'm wondering if you guys could characterize what you're seeing from a backlog work down versus new patients entering the system, if there's a way to sort of even qualitatively characterize that? And then the second part of the question for Ashley, I'll just ask it now. As we think about the referral funnel refill within devices, and maybe this is even an appropriate question for pharma and diagnoses, where do you see the areas that are most susceptible should we see some hiccups in the referral funnel reselling? Ashley McEvoy : So thank you, Danielle. When we look at -- again, I have to give a huge acknowledgment to our customers, quite frankly, around the world of how they've really figured out how to manage people with COVID as well as manage patients who don't have COVID. And when we look at our top 10 markets, we see about a 95% recovery to-date in the past 4 weeks. And really, obviously, with China leading the way, but we also saw positives in areas like Germany, in areas like Russia. In the United States, it is around 95%, and -- which is remarkable, if you think about it, that we're in October. And then we look at the top 10 IDNs, which are really -- many of those are presenting more hotter spots for COVID, they're around 92% recovered. And clearly, some hospitals are well above 100, and some are a little softer than that. And so I think it really demonstrates to us that they have really learned how to manage those patient populations quite well. And when we go forward, we did see in quarter 3, a significant kind of clearing out of the patient backlog. We think when we go into quarter 4, there's a little bit more to go. What we're paying attention to is really the diagnosis, Danielle, to say, let me give you an example, colorectal surgery. Those colorectal surgeries in the United States are down about 10% to 12% from a procedure point of view versus pre-COVID baseline. But the diagnosis, the colonoscopy is down about 20% to 30%. Now that's improving because that used to be down 50%. So we're looking at MRIs for joint and spine surgeries. And when we start to see that number improve, I think it shows that the new patient funnel is starting to replenish at a pace we hope to have. Jennifer Taubert : So when we look on the pharma side, so we continue to see improving new-to-brand trends. For some of the assets, there's still a little bit below pre-COVID levels as patients are just getting back in for the diagnosis and the workups and everything to ultimately get diagnosed and then treated. But as we take a look at total demand, most of our brands and as we're looking across the market, are really back to and above pre-COVID levels. And we\u2019re definitely seeing stability and some growth in that area. I think while new-to-brand has still been a bit depressed, what we're seeing is higher rates of refills, higher rates of persistency and lower rates of switch. And so they sort of compensate for each other. And so we've been really pleased with the recovery that we've seen. We think that our customers as well are really adapting and figuring out how to use a combination of both telehealth as well as in-person visits depending upon the actual patient and potential diagnosis and we see very positive trends going forward. And should there be any type of second wave, we think that they're going to be much better able to handle that in the second wave than what we saw originally. Chris DelOrefice : Rob, next question please? Operator : Next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering on the COVID vaccine, if you can remind us of what you're hoping to show on the efficacy profile? And then second part of that question is, what steps both you and the industry can take to encourage broad utilization of a vaccine, if successful? And then my second question relates to your EGFR MET antibody, some pretty compelling Phase 1 data at ESMO this year. You mentioned this asset a couple of times in your remarks, but maybe you could just expand on the development program here for lung cancer and also other tumors, such as head and neck and colorectal and remind us of how you're thinking about both the near-term opportunity as well as the longer term opportunity? Chris DelOrefice : Mathai, do you want to address the vaccine question and start with the pipeline? Mathai Mammen : Sure. So in terms of the vaccine overall, like as soon as we overcome this temporary pause. Our plan is to continue to pursue studies that were on route. And the vaccine efficacy -- specifically was your question, all statistical analysis plan assume something and we've assumed 70% vaccine efficacy for this trial. But of course, based on the Phase 1/2a data, we're very bullish on that or better efficacy. So, if we happen to see better efficacy than that, what will happen, we\u2019ll see events -- will -- as they come in, will show a greater imbalance between placebo and vaccine. And we have a chance to finish even faster. And so that's how it'll manifest, we just assume something for the moment. But that doesn\u2019t actually dictate how the study is conducted. Chris DelOrefice : Jennifer, do you want to take the broader vaccine question, and we can come back to amivantamab. Jennifer Taubert : Sure. So a couple of points. So first, our industry is demonstrating really heroic and historic leadership during this public health crisis. And between everything that, the R&D teams and manufacturing teams are doing around the clock to help bring forward new vaccines and new treatments, as well as what the commercial teams are doing to be prepared to both be able to supply these products in the marketplace but also make sure that there's going to be a receptive audience and demand, people actually wanting to get these vaccines once they get to market. There's a lot of work that's underway there now. What I can say is, as an industry group, we really have come together. And in working with our local industry associations, be they bio or pharma in the U.S., be at IFPMA ex-U.S., there's a lot of work that's underway to help develop and build vaccine confidence across the board by different types of audiences. So everything from making sure that providers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, people who would be involved in the administration have accurate information and information that they can use with their patients, because they're viewed so positively to broad campaigns, to even very targeted local campaigns to get add on specific minority populations, who otherwise might not be as receptive. All of this work is currently underway and I think you can look forward to many types of different campaigns to enroll all of the appropriate folks at the appropriate time, once we have greater line of sight into when these products will actually be able to reach the market.  But safe to say everybody realizes the vaccine confidence is really, really key. And there's a lot of great work that that's being done and more to come on that as we're able to start unveiling it as the products get closer to the market and emergencies authorizations. Thibaut Mongon : Thanks, Jennifer. Maybe I can take the question on the EGFR-cMet antibody amivantamab. It is a really exciting project for us. You asked about near-term and long-term. First on the antibody itself, it's a really interesting antibody. It's unique to us and it incorporates both EGFR binding peak and the CMS binding peak and CMS is common resistance mechanism for EGFR therapy. So it's both the primary mutation and the resistance mechanism at the same time. The near-term plan is to go forward with an Exon 20 EGFR tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, there are really no good opportunities for patients with Exon 20 signatures. But that's how we will begin but our eyes are on the larger EGFR mutation market and patients in non-small lung cancer. So with time, we plan on exploring multiple lines of therapy and eventually all EGFR containing tumors. Chris DelOrefice : Rob, last question please? Operator : That comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : So I wanted to ask you on the FDA. Have you any change in their appetite for risk. We've seen a recent speed of complete response letter, not sure if that's just a timing issue or if they've truly changed your thinking there? And then just a follow-up question here on the vaccine, how any potential changes to your vaccine program impact the manufacturing process you've already started? And how many patients have you dosed thus far? Chris DelOrefice : Mathai, with the vaccine and then Jennifer and/or Mathai weighing on the FDA. Actually Mathai, why don' you start with the vaccine? Mathai Mammen : Yes, vaccine question. So this interaction right now we're having with regulators and DSMB doesn't change our manufacturing process or plans at all. And we're well underway with our program right now, and we're looking forward to getting going. Our overall plans are to complete recruitment of the [50,000] subjects in 2 or 3 months, and that remains on track. Jennifer Taubert : Yes. And in terms of our working with the agency, we've had a really good track record over the past few months, really during the height of COVID and continuing to submit files, have them accepted and really importantly, get approvals, not only on time but actually ahead of time. So as an example, our DARZALEX FASPRO formulation, our subcu form for multiple myeloma was actually approved ahead of schedule. We had an IMBRUVICA new indication. As you know, we've got 11 indications now for IMBRUVICA. And we had 1 of the new ones there approved ahead of time. I mentioned TREMFYA PSA in that approval. And I could go on and list others, but we continue to have very productive conversations with the FDA and continue to have our products moving through the pipeline as anticipated, and in some cases, even faster than planned. Ashley McEvoy : Yes. Just to complement what Jennifer mentioned -- this is Ashley, Louise, I would just echo that from a med tech point of view. You heard us share around the new indication in our PMA for persistent AFib. But recently, in the past couple of months, we were granted a breakthrough designation for the slowing down the progression of myopia in our vision business. That's moving forward nicely, and we were granted a breakthrough designation that's moving forward nicely on the combination of our Monarch and Illumina Diagnostics, coupled with our NeuWave ablation technology for lung nodules. But from a notion of regulatory approvals and engagement as well as audits, I couldn't be more encouraged. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, everyone. Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. And thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joe Wolk : Great. Thank you, Chris, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter results and your very thoughtful questions. I'd also like to take a moment to just thank the Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their unrelenting commitment to deliver for patients and all of our stakeholders around the world. Don't forget to mark your calendars to join us for our virtual medical device update on Thursday, November 19. Best wishes for continued safety and health and know that we will responsibly provide relevant, transparent updates as warranted. Bye for now. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. The call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and our financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there's significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Alex will provide perspective on our overall results and business highlights for the year. I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment, and our guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. I would now turn the call over to Alex to share our overall results and business highlights. Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Chris. And thank you everyone for taking time to join us today to discuss our full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation on just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security, and prosperity as a society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff serving on the frontlines of care, for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running, and expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever. As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these. We've been leading through the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses touch so many parts of people's lives. We had both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic. Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase 3 study by early next week. Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working, and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on a shorter term top and bottom line business goals, while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture and the core strengths that characterize our Company for over a century; execution, innovation, and people. Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. The performance of our business in 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers, and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track, and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility leading to a strong second half recovery. Our unparalleled scientific expertise allowed us to create life-enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for our BCMA Car-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of Exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe. Our Medical Devices business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline, despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the Medical Devices Update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across three robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20, and 30 years. I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a number 3 ranking across all industries on its Annual 2020 Supply Chain Top 25 Index. That's up five spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the number one spot on its 2020 Health care Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose, and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. So, with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West to our Board of Directors. Dr. West\u2019s accomplished healthcare background in addition to her deep strategic leadership experience are strong additions to our Board of Directors. In October, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of her recognition for this incredible work. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both, our workforce and the communities at which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. Our Race to Health Equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful, lasting change. And most importantly, the talented and committed people at Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We think and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better health for everyone everywhere. I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you. Chris? Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Alex. Now, to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.1% as currency had a positive impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.3% worldwide, 9.6% in the U.S. and 4.8% outside the U.S. As referenced on prior calls, I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, it does not represent a full week of sales but rather a few more shipping days with these additional shipping days adding approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. This can be roughly applied across all segments. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S. For the enterprise, offsetting this sales benefit was the estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, while these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the impact to earnings was negligible. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $1.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.50 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.86, representing decreases of 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.2%. For the full year 2020, consolidated sales were $82.6 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2019. Operationally, full year sales grew 1.2% with currency having a negative impact of 0.6 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year change was negative 1.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. declined by 0.2% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.5% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 0.2% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2020 were $14.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.51 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.63 a year ago. 2020 adjusted net earnings were $21.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.03, representing decreases of 8.1% and 7.5%, respectively, versus full year 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 7.8%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2020 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.6 billion and grew 2% with growth in the U.S. of 2.7% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Consumer Health delivered strong above-market growth due to our Oral Care, Wound Care and OUS Skin Health/Beauty businesses partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19, primarily in our OTC business and the SKU rationalization program, which predominantly impacted Baby and Skin Health/Beauty outside the U.S. E-commerce growth continues to be strong across regions and franchises. Over-the-counter medicines had a decline of 1.5%. In the U.S., OTC sales were flat and the OUS declined by 2.9%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences, impacting children's TYLENOL, global cough and cold and digestive products. Offsetting these declines was strong adult TYLENOL market and share growth attributed to elevated demand, driven by COVID-19, ZYRTEC share growth, partially due to competitive out-of-stock and strong market growth in anti-smoking aids in EMEA. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise experienced recovery with a 2.6% increase, driven by strong performance of OGx due to share gains and OUS growth for Dr. Ci Labo, partially offset by NEUTROGENA declines as retailers carry less inventory, coupled with market declines, primarily in the makeup category due to fewer use occasions driven by COVID-19 restrictions and SKU rationalization. As consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, Oral Care grew by 12% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new flavor and product innovations and the increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound Care grew 12.2%, primarily due to strong performance across NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID brand adhesive bandages in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In the baby franchise, we saw AVEENO baby strength, offset by our planned SKU rationalization program, primarily outside the U.S. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.3 billion grew 14.6%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 15.3% and OUS sales increasing by 13.5%. The business realized double-digit growth in 8 key products across our portfolio, supporting growth in all therapeutic areas except for cardiovascular metabolism, other, which experienced a decline of 1%, primarily driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver our ninth consecutive year of global adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. Our oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 23.7%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 49%, led by share gains globally with the U.S. market share up about 4 points across all lines of therapy. Furthermore, the U.S. and European markets continue to exhibit increased adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the recent U.S. approval of DARZALEX FASPRO for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain amyloidosis. IMBRUVICA grew 25.3% globally, mainly driven by market growth and our strong leadership position in all key indications. We continue to progress the development of IMBRUVICA to further differentiate this BTK inhibitor, as evidenced by the robust data presentation at the American Society of Hematology Conference in December. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum with sales of just over $240 million in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 15.3%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA grew 30.3%, driven by global demand increase in Crohn's Disease with over a 5-point share increase in the U.S. and continued growth in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA grew 39.3% and is up about 3 points of share from the fourth quarter of 2019 in the psoriasis market in U.S. TREMFYA continues to strengthen its leadership position as the most prescribed IL-23 inhibitor for patients worldwide through its differentiated data package in both, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We also continued to advance TREMFYA\u2019s pipeline as evidenced by Phase 2 Crohn's Disease data that was presented earlier this year. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In 2020, we filed submissions in the U.S. and EU for paliperidone palmitate six-month formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. And if approved, it will be the first and only long-acting injectable medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 37.4% with OPSUMIT growth of 36.7% and UPTRAVI growth of 44.1%, both driven by market penetration and share growth, as well as a onetime benefit of about 10 points each, resulting from the U.S. distributor model change we communicated in Q4 2019. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 1.5% worldwide. Onetime items positively impacted the current quarter by about 200 basis points. The net benefit from these onetime items is comprised of the benefit of the extra shipping days associated with the 53rd week, partially offset by the anticipated inventory contractions in China across our portfolio, and in our U.S. contact lens business, as communicated last quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, Q4 results were in line with Q3 2020 performance. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable within the medical device market. In Q4, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels in certain parts of the world while cases remain relatively stable in others. This did lead to some softening in recovery trends late in the quarter. However, impacts varied across geographies and procedure types. Looking geographically, China, where COVID-19 cases have continued to remain more stable, delivered double-digit growth within the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the additional shipping days, the U.S. declined low single digits, due to COVID-19-related restrictions occurring late in the quarter. Sales also declined in Europe, where some of the strictest restrictions were deployed to curb the increases in COVID-19 cases. As we have noted previously, health care systems continue to demonstrate their resiliency and dedication to treating both, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, resulting in significantly less disruption during this recent surge of cases versus the impact seen earlier this year. Interventional Solutions continue to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 12.7% globally led by market recovery and share gains from new products. CERENOVUS returned to double-digit growth with strong sales in China. Worldwide orthopedics declined 5.3% versus prior year, driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 where procedures deem to be more elective in nature. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 3.6% globally. U.S. growth of 10% for the quarter reflects market recovery as well as success of our new products, such as the cannulated compression headless screws. Declines of about 6% outside the U.S. reflects slower procedural volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as contractions in inventory in China worth around 400 basis points. Worldwide hips declined 2.7%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the market. U.S. declined 0.7% versus prior year and continues to benefit from our leadership position in an interior approach and strong demand for the active stem and enabling technologies, helping to partially offset the negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to introduce innovation in this space, and in December, we entered the modular dual mobility market with the first implant of PINNACLE dual mobility, which is planned for a full U.S. market launch this year. These declined 13.9% globally as we continue to see procedures in this space highly impacted by COVID-19, especially revision procedures, where we have a higher share than primary. The 20.6% decline outside of the U.S. reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on procedures, especially in markets like the UK and India, where we hold higher share positions. We are very excited about the FDA clearance of our VELYS orthopedic robotic system and bringing this to the U.S. market in 2021. The combination of the differentiated robotic system with our ATTUNE knee platform are expected to drive enhanced performance in this segment. Worldwide decline in spine of 7.1% reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the market as well as inventory reductions in China impacting global performance by about 350 basis points. Offsetting this decline is the growth we continue to see from the success of recent launches of new products such as SYMPHONY and CONDUIT. For the quarter, U.S. price remained consistent with historical levels, down low single digits. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery returned to growth with a 2% increase versus prior year, led by strong performance in U.S. biosurgery, which grew 12.1% in the quarter. U.S. biosurgery growth is due to the strength of SURGIFLO and the continued recovery from the previously disclosed 2019 stopped shipment. Endocutters delivered 1.6% growth, mainly driven by the success of new products in China, offsetting impacts from COVID-19. Energy declined by 3.1%, reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S., partially offset by the strength of new products outside the U.S. This month, we received FDA 510(k) clearances for both, the ENSEAL X1 Curved and Straight Jaw Tissue Sealer instruments, which will further strengthen our portfolio of advanced energy devices. Global wound closure grew by 1.5% through the strength of STRATAFIX barbed suture and PRINEO topical skin adhesive products in both, the U.S. and OUS markets. Inventory dynamics in the quarter added about 350 basis points to the U.S. growth of 8.5% and negatively impacted the OUS decline of 2.9% by about 150 basis points. The vision business declined 6.6% globally. U.S. contact lens declined 7.1%. However, after adjusting for the impact of both, the additional shipping days this quarter and the impact of the anticipated channel inventory correction communicated last quarter, worth about 9 points, the underlying U.S. contact lens business grew and continues to deliver competitive performance. While surgical vision declined 10.1% globally, this represents an improvement from Q3 where the business declined 16.4% with the most notable improvement in the U.S. This improvement is due to both, improvement in the cataract and refractive markets as well as new products like TECNIS Toric II IOL for astigmatism. Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported earlier, our adjusted EPS of $1.86 reflects a reported decrease of 1.1% and an operational decrease of 3.2%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost, impacting the medical device business, partially offset by favorable enterprise portfolio mix and portfolio mix within the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved for the quarter as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical and consumer businesses, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 17.9% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by 230 basis points, driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $16 million last year. This was primarily driven by higher litigation expenses related to a Missouri Supreme Court verdict on talc in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was previously disclosed in our November 3 8-K filing and we intend to seek review of that decision by the United States Supreme Court. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate decreased from 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a 5.5% benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decline was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with the fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 11.4% versus 10.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-K for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.1% to 24.9%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 impact this quarter. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 900 basis points, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. Consumer margins improved by 430 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including execution of our SKU rationalization program. The decline in Pharmaceutical margins of 90 basis points was primarily driven by investment in R&D associated with portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule, where again, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported today, our full year 2020 adjusted EPS of $8.03 reflects a reported decrease of 7.5% and an operational decrease of 7.8%. The decline is primarily related to COVID-19 impacts realized predominantly in our medical device business, along with increased R&D investment, including the investment associated with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2020 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise decreased by 360 basis points versus 2019. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices declined from 35.4% in the previous year to 17%, primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. 2019 also includes approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 200 basis points to 42%, driven by favorable product mix and sales, marketing and administrative expense leveraging. Consumer margins improved by 240 basis points to 23.8% driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including the execution of our SKU rationalization program. Moving on to important developments. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. For your planning purposes, we plan to host a business review, featuring our Pharmaceutical business on November 18th of this year. The format and location will be announced at a later date, but we hope that you're able to join us for this event, where we look forward to sharing the details about our robust pipeline and differentiated capabilities, that gives us the confidence in our ability to sustain growth in Pharmaceuticals at above-market levels. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation, despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. But, first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principal in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. One element of our business that we're particularly proud of that despite the challenges of 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continued to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody-driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences investigational gene therapy, HMR59, a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration, where currently, there are no other approved therapies. And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past four years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume-driven. So, let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note upfront that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates, as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April. Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and as such are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0%, or $88.8 billion to $90.0 billion. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement, driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The medical device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020. Considering these items, results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared along with some additional P&L items, to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both, the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. I'll address each segment starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development, impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. Turning to our Medical Device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both, COVID and non-COVID patients, resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. As you heard during our Medical Device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021, primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like Skin Health and Beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, not just in 2021, but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. So, I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session. Chris? Chris DelOrefice : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Good morning. Thanks again for all the work you're doing to combat the pandemic and looking forward to the vaccine data next week. I was just wondering, with respect to the vaccine trial, if you can remind us what percentage of participants were enrolled in South Africa and Brazil, and if you're gathering sequencing data from these participants that become infected. And when you report the data, are you going to break out results by geography? And hence, will we have any insight in terms of the vaccine efficacy against some of these new variants? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey Terence, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level, and once again, note, what I think has just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000 approximate associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we mentioned earlier today, whether it's almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths, that's taken a tremendous cost on certainly families, individuals, businesses, our economy on just so many different aspects of our life that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements, but also if you look at the investment that we made in research and development, in sales and marketing preparing for the future not only 2021, but that and beyond, again we think we're well-positioned and stronger as we finished the year than even when we began. Now, getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program not only geographically, but also by ethnicity, gender, as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, so stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, and Chris we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists, Dr. Mathai Mammen, Dr. Paul Stoffels, and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : One more, one on the vaccine and then one financial question. So, Alex or Joe, I heard Joe's comments on CNBC about your expectations for the vaccine to be robust. What do you think you need to show to be competitive? Is 70% a good floor? And Joe, do you still expect to produce 1 billion doses in 2021? And just lastly, I know you said that you're not going to give any financial guidance until I think your next call. But since the data is coming next week, any color on pricing and margins during and after the pandemic? Thanks, guys. Alex Gorsky : Hey Larry, thank you very much for your question. As I mentioned earlier, I think it would be inappropriate for us to speculate in any significant way, given the proximity that we are today versus when we expect the results. What we said from the very beginning is that we put a lot of work and thought and very strong science and review into the selection of our lead candidate. I think, the Phase 1 and 2a results, particularly those that were recently published, we are hopeful that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in larger population, of course, until we see this final data. We won't know for certain, but look we remain optimistic, and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review. I'll hand it over to Joe to take the second part of that question. Joe Wolk : Sure. Good morning, Larry. And thanks for the question. I would say with respect to supply, consistent with the comments that were made earlier, we intend to meet all of the firm order commitments that we have, whether that be to the United States, to the European Union or to developing countries through the Gavi organization. And right now, we're well on track to do that. As Alex alluded to, there is still some fluidity with respect to timelines. And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think, the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So, it's somewhat of a fluid situation, and that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place, and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : I guess just -- maybe just two quick ones here for me. The one would just be just in general, as you think about new variants in the marketplace and the need for a booster. I wonder if you could just comment on number one, when can we expect the dual dose data, and what are your thoughts about the booster relative to the mRNA-based platforms? And then, I guess, just on earnings strength for next year, '21, Joe, just 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, just seems like given the earnings upside relative to consensus estimates, you probably need a margin number that is maybe closer to 300 basis points of year-on-year upside versus 200. So just give us any sense of what's driving margin strength, some of that's medical device recovery. I'm sure some of that's pharma strength as well. But, it'd be super helpful, just give us a sense of the earnings momentum into '21. Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Hey David, this is Alex. I'll take the first part and then let Joe take the second one. Look, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to pull together all of our data. We're enrolling, as we speak, in the dual dose information. We would expect that -- to have that in the back end of this year. And again, as we -- just as we try to be very transparent and very thorough in the disclosure that we're releasing, we certainly will plan to follow that course with that trial as well. And again, we'll get out information as soon as we can. Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely, based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you heard from some of the other companies, about what are potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think, it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have that we should have shortly. And I think Dr. Paul Stoffels and Dr. Mathai Mammen, once we have that, will be able to give a much more comprehensive review on exactly how we think our vaccine will work against the current strains and variants and our plans for the future. Joe? Joe Wolk : Good morning, David. With respect to kind of the earnings outlook and specifically, the operating margins, you're correct. And not to get cute, but the words were actually greater than 200 basis points. So, that could gravitate upward. We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify, not just this year, but well beyond. In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on consumer sales in the first half of the year, but again, with this objective of improving profit margins, and that team has done a great job under Thibaut\u2019s leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last two years. You may also recall a few years back made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then, like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work and work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward. So, those are some of the factors that are going into our bullish call of above 200 basis points margin improvement. Operator : Next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : So, just curious if you could comment on the durability of your vaccine versus the other vaccines that are in development or at least your goals for durability, you did highlight that you your Phase 1/2 data. And the second question is just as Biden rolls out on his health care policies, are there any big moving parts that you see as potential pushes and pulls to the health care industry? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey Louise, Alex. Thanks again for your question. Regarding durability, again, we're going to have to see how some of the early data in some of the preclinical work that we have done plays out in the actual large-scale trials. We're certainly hopeful that you're going to see a durable and a sustainable and patent response, particularly from our vector approach. We have seen that in other programs that we run. So, we're hopeful that we'll see it here, but we would expect that to play out. We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our other final results. Secondly, more broadly, about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think, in the near term, what we've learned is frankly the importance of innovation and science. And if you reflect back on where we were, just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now in the number, not only of very innovative vaccine candidates, but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started to using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think clearly, another example. Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean, I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies, society, just at a number of different levels. So, those are perhaps some of the longer term trends. And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news, not only for patients, certainly in health care systems, but for the industry as well. Joe Wolk : Hey Louise, maybe just one other comment to build upon Alex's commentary is that you've referenced towards the end of your question about the new administration and what kind of policies they may have around health care. What I would say is we've been around for 135 years. It's I think 24 different administrations from both, Republican and Democrat. We're going to continue to do what we do best, and that's to innovate. And if I look at our pharmaceutical portfolio, the great performance that they delivered in 2020 was once again met with, for the fourth consecutive year, price decreases overall in the portfolio. So, we're seeing the benefit of innovation, whether it be for the COVID-19 vaccine or other solutions in immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and neuroscience. And so, that's what we're going to be focused on. And by the way, Louise, I just got a comment. You did a really nice job on the news program this morning. That was outstanding work by you. Alex Gorsky : Hey Louise, I might just add one other point and that is, we actually look forward to working with the new administration on issues related to health care. Clearly, the pandemic we feel will shape the perspective in terms of the prioritization around access, around innovation, and frankly, using this as an opportunity to improve the overall health care system. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Just on 2021 device sales, can you just help us quantify or provide more color around how much of an impact COVID will still be having on sales, but what you consider to be I guess normalized levels? I'm just trying to get a sense of how close to normalized is 2021 as we maybe think about 2022 and beyond? Is there another step-up in sales we need to be thinking about in that time frame? My second quick one was just on STELARA. The product is obviously generating very healthy growth, despite increased competition in the psoriasis space. Maybe a little bit more color there in terms of the sustainability of growth you see as we just think about that franchise evolving over time? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Chris, look, overall, we remain very confident in the long-term prospects around the medical device market. And I think we saw very good signs of that actually over the course of 2020, where we saw the medical device market drop anywhere from 30% to up to 70%, depending on which category you're looking at, to return to mid-single-digit drops in the third quarter as we went through the rest of the year. As Joe and I believe Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. There are certainly regions and hospitals around the world, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such, for example, in the UK, a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter, in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021. And beyond that again see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single-digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well. Chris DelOrefice : There was also a question about STELARA. Alex Gorsky : Yes. Regarding STELARA, look, we remain very upbeat on the overall performance of STELARA. I mean, if you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, it was about 30% growth for the full year. We are looking at 20% growth. And what's really important to remember about STELARA is just the diversity of indications now that we have with that compound, especially in GI conditions, where we think it's particularly differentiated and unique, both in terms of its efficacy and now a very robust safety profile as well, based upon the years of experience. It is a competitive category. There are a number of new agents. But we also know that this is an area of significant unmet medical need, again, particularly in the Crohn\u2019s space and the rest of the GI category. And so, we think there remains really good opportunity for us to continue to not only maintain but grow our position. Joe Wolk : And Chris, if you look at where the growth is coming from for STELARA in recent quarters, it has been in the GI indications that Alex has noted where we're really seeing nice growth in uptake in psoriasis is TREMFYA. You're right, it's a competitive market space, but we\u2019re seeing some switches out of STELARA to TREMFYA, and then TREMFYA is picking up new scripts on its own for our psoriasis play. Chris DelOrefice : And just for context, the share growth in Crohn's and STELARA was over 5 points quarter-over-quarter, so seeing great progress there. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions. Rob, next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Two questions in medical device land. With the VELYS approval, can you sort of give us a date on how you're thinking about rolling that out, and whether or not those plans change in the current environment? And then, in Vision Care, there are a couple of different pushes and pulls going on, both in contact lenses as well as in vision surgery. Could you tease that out a little bit as we think about SKU rationalization versus competitive pressures? Alex Gorsky : Sure. And good to hear from you, Joanne. Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our Innovation Day with our Medical Device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So, when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and ultimately for patients and their families. I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans. But, what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But, we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and again, expanding our overall position. Regarding Vision Care, you're right. There are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year, in the contact lens market, significant contraction as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen. And we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year, and we think we'll be well-positioned as we enter 2021. We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the TECNIS Symfony launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus. And we also have a TECNIS Synergy IOL, a first-in-class product, combining a number of different technologies, to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21. So, again, we remain very confident and optimistic about the potential overall in our Vision Care business. Chris DelOrefice : Yes. Joanne, just a couple of small builds. In contact lens, as we have noted in prior quarter, if you remember, in the U.S., there was double-digit growth, and some of those were some of the retail dynamics as it related to inventory and stocking that you noted, adjusting for that contact lens did grow. It was worth almost 9 points. And we do view our growth is still competitive versus the market. And then, on the surgical side, it was actually good. We did see some recovery in the market there. So, it's good to see the trend. While we're still declining, it's improving sequentially, and we remain optimistic, including the innovation that Alex mentioned. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : So, just a couple of follow-ups on Med Devices. You've made some great progress in 2020, closing the gap on digital surgery and abdominal surgery, orthopedics and lung. And just curious, sort of following on to Joanne's question around the VELYS rollout is, how to think about this -- you get recovery in volumes generally in the market, in some of these end markets, and then, you've got sort of the benefit of these new digital surgery sort of launches. And is that -- do we see that in back half of the year? Do we start to see ortho this year and Ottava maybe the following year? If you could just maybe lay out the cadence for both the top line and any investments that those entail for Med Devices, that would be super helpful. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, we were -- I think, it's important to put maybe perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5-point, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and vision care and others, cardiovascular, are in the 4% to 5% range. And that's the goal for our businesses. As we -- of course, with 2019 -- or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement to not only our ATTUNE system, but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back, as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others just because many of those procedures can be delayed, perhaps versus a hip procedure. But, we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs and when -- we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to. And we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But, whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned. Operator : Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : I just have a quick COVID question. And I'm sorry if I missed this, Alex. I feel like you did allude to the in response to Matt's question. But, over the last two quarters, you had given pretty detailed numbers around the COVID impact. Is there any way you could give that for this quarter, just to get a sense of sort of what the normalized growth rate actually would have been, were it not for the COVID resurgence? Thanks so much. Alex Gorsky : Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I can take that one. Yes, we were able to do that in Q1 because there was an early impact. And then, what we did was as we provided guidance throughout the year, we kind of gave you a range of expected impact by quarter, based on what our original guidance would have been at the beginning of the year. If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year, plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range, given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December timeframe where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range. So, overall, in line with expectations, but more towards the low end, given some of the surge we saw at the very end. Operator : The last question will be coming from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thank you very much. Just one quick one. I appreciate the comment that globally in Q4, Medical Device revenue declines were really no worse than Q3 when you adjust out the onetimers. That's pretty impressive given the headlines. I was wondering if you could give us a sense to what happened to device growth, maybe in the United States in Q4 relative to Q3, again net of those onetimers. And also on the U.S., if we think about 2021, is it too aggressive to assume that in the back half of 2021, based on everything you're seeing today that we might be able to approach normal levels of surgical procedure volumes in the United States? I appreciate the comments. Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey Bob. Thank you very much. What we saw in North America in Q4 was it down just about -- or excuse me, up about 2%. And again, there were regions around the country where we saw a differential impact. But, I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States being able to continue to provide elective procedures, even in spite of some of the later surges where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period. And because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe that had a differential impact on us. And again, as hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. And so, regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of assumptions, a lot of dynamics that we'll have to watch closely. But, our current plans would take those kind of projections into consideration. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Thanks everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Apologies to those who we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team, as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex for some brief closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : Well, thank you everyone for your comments, for your questions and for your ongoing interest, trust and confidence in Johnson & Johnson. It's likely an overused term at this point, but 2020 was a remarkable year on just so many different fronts. And I want to again end where I started by acknowledging the tremendous toll that this has taken on patients, on families, on the hospital systems around the world, but also give credit to health care systems and our employees who\u2019ve worked so hard to continue to support the same, through this challenging period. We're proud of our performance. We think we're positioned very well as we embark on 2021, and we look forward to keeping you updated as we go through the year and gain more information and insights. Thank you very much, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be; Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board Of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee; Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is at best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2020 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and we'll spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary, and we'll outline our updated guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. Now let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $22.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.9% versus the first quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 5.5% as currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points. In the US, sales increased 3.9%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 12.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 7.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the US and 8.2% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset, amortization expense and special items for both periods adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59 representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%. I would now comment on business segment sales performance highlighting items that build upon the slide you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3% with declines in the US of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the US. The Consumer Health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior-year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low-single-digits in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally results were negatively impacted by the prior-year comparisons, I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were US share gains, primarily in TYLENOL, ZYRTEC and PEPCID as well as strong performance of NICORETTE outside the US. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise grew by 2.8% driven by strong performance outside the US for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by US COVID-19 related market contraction in makeup removal wipes. Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including oral care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth excluding divestitures was approximately 8%. Additionally the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the US, primarily in Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories coupled with AVEENO baby growth in e-commerce globally. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1% with strength in both the US, increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the US from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its emergency use authorization in February. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels with seven key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continue to show strength in all regions growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. US share increased roughly four points in Crohn's Disease and nearly 10-points in ulcerative colitis. STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1, 2020, and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020 resulting from COVID-19 related longer scrip durations in the US and Europe. TREMFYA grew 37.8% with strong double-digit growth in both the US and OUS driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the US, continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the US and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations, posting nearly three points of share growth in Line one in the US this quarter. ERLEADA continued its global momentum with growth of 79.7% in the quarter driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally with increased volume growth driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. Growth was also negatively impacted by one-time items including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term scrip durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these one-time events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double-digits. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 4.1% this quarter driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO driven by continued demand and a one-time favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter. Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9% both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.6 billion growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19 along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full-year impact from selling days excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020 will be minimal. While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with nine of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1 with six of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China against this low sales base from the prior year. So that coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the US. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover resulting in growth of 5.4% in the US. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals. Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products such as an update to our CARTO 3 System and the CARTO PRIME Mapping Module which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduced ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures. Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year with continued COVID-19 impacts of procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5% reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma such as the most comprehensive Cannulated Compression Headless Screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long-bone grafts. Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter increasing 3.2% driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the interior approach and demand for the ACTIS Stem aided by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation. Knees declined 9.9% globally, primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for the commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and Attune platform including some cementless offerings will enhance our portfolio and support improve performance, as procedures continue to recover. Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market coupled with some one-time stocking reductions in China resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model, worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by the success of the recently launched products such as, Symphony, Conduit and Fibergraft as well as partnerships which further enhance our offerings such as, the X-Pac Expandable Cage. Advanced surgery grew 14.3% versus the prior year with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches, globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgery, Surgiflo Plus Thrombin launch in Japan, and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China. In general surgery, wound closure, grew 12% globally with a growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% in OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio including the STRATAFIX barbed suture family. The U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of Acuvue Oasys, multi-focal lenses which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances. Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects a slower market recovery in Japan and Europe. The global surgical vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of a recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as the continued strength of recent product introductions, including Tecnis Toric II and early success of Tecnis Eyhance driving improved share momentum in both the U.S, and OUS markets. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6%, and an operational increase of 8.3%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed the misstatement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. The cost of product sold improved versus 2020 as a percent to sales due to favorable product mix in the pharmaceutical business, and favorable volume and mix in the medical devices business. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2020, medical devices results included the establishment of COVID-19 inventory reserve which did not repeat in 2021. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging the medical devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points, driven by portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant gains as a special item and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of one-time items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical devices margin improved by 640 basis points driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020 associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter and overall expense leveraging in 2021 resulting from the medical devices sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 150 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix partially offset by increased investment in research and development. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full-year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced much like every other company in every other industry. COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our lifesaving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic and our first-quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long-term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities when appropriate to create value over the long-term. Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few starting with our pharmaceutical business. First, we received US approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first EMEA approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA Car-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma and we anticipate US approval later this year. As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the phase 2 development of Tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial. Within our medical devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for Tecnis Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years. Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect the commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name, Acuvue Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline. As Chris commented to earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first-quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So, let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. Our pharmaceutical segment is on track with our expectations and in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven not dependent on price. You may have noticed that we issued our fifth annual Janssen US Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than t$29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated. In consumer health, prior-year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile, driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs. In medical devices, better execution, new innovative offerings, and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage, and unemployment rates along with the easing of mobility restrictions will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full-year outlook we had in January. Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS, already projected to grow at 18%, or 1.8 times greater than sales growth. Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please know that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted. Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion, or 8.2% to 9.4%. While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.19, results in a still favorable, but to a lesser degree currency impact of $1.3 billion, or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9%, or 10.3 at that midpoint versus 2020. Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are however comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57 or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models. This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in medical devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in medical devices. Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome, but more importantly accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Stoffels : Thank you, Joe and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than three million people globally. From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single-shot easily transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing in affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country phase 3 ENSEMBLE study that demonstrates the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, beginning day 28 of the vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus including the B.1.3.5.1 variant. Based on the robust data, we submitted to health authorities, we received emergency use authority -- authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use listing from the World Health Organization. We began US distribution in March with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-label phase 3b vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline healthcare workers in South Africa, where the B.1.3.5.1variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of wide -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across the African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single-shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical tool for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. Last Tuesday, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of their vaccine in the US. ACIP will reconvene this Friday and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of their vaccine in Europe and paused vaccinations in all of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we've updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and wellbeing of the people who use our product is our number one priority. And we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by healthcare professionals. We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine. And in view of the raise -- raging pandemic, that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA to work toward continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the paused in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- of available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of healthcare workers in South Africa soon. We are looking forward to the outcome of -- from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency, Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC, as it is called and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. Moving on to manufacturing, the quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with the U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. Our goal remains ensuring all drugs and drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standards and securing emergency use authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single-shot doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. In conclusion, I want to note that, COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Paul. We will now move to a Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Question-and: Operator : Yes. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. And I appreciate all the color on the business dynamics here. I just have two questions, centered around, the vaccine I guess, first how do you see this clotting risk issue being addressed. Is this going to be just some sort of safety warning to physicians? Or do you think that's going to be a way to identify certain populations where this might not be an appropriate vaccine? And maybe tied to that, how are you thinking about addressing public safety perceptions, given what seems to be a very rare side effect if in fact [indiscernible] once vaccinations resume. If I could just slip another quick one on vaccines in there, just want to make sure I'm clear as well. On the guidance for 2021, are there vaccine sales beyond Q1 reflective of that guidance? Or just given some the uncertainty is that not being included in the updated guidance? Thanks so much. Paul Stoffels : Okay. Yes, let me take the first question. We are working very closely both with FDA CDC as well with EMA and the PRAC, on addressing your first question on risk and whether there will be guidance. And we'll work closely if that comes out in the course of the week to implement that globally. But also restore the confidence in the vaccine. It's an extremely rare event. We hope by making people aware as well as putting clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines in place that we can restore the confidence in our vaccine. Joe Wolk : And Chris with respect to financial guidance, there is nothing in our future outlook with respect to that at this point in time. So we will -- when it's warranted certainly provide updates. Right now we're just commenting to what was actually experienced in the first quarter. Thanks for your question. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me. Joe, can you talk a little bit you know medical device sales came in better than our expectations? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the end markets with regard to the recovery? And can you also secondly talk about the quarterly EPS phasing. Why didn't you raise EPS guidance more despite the beat Q1 EPS is usually about 24%, 25% of full-year EPS whereas the guidance implies Q1 EPS is about 27% using that midpoint. So why not raise the guidance more? Thanks for taking the questions guys. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Larry. Thank you very much for your questions. This is Alex. Why don't I go first and look before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout-out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus or minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic. Two; a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them. And last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability the Johnson & Johnson remains a very consistent and in fact stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position whether its market share on all of our major $28 billion plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline, progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress in spite of a lot of other dynamics. So giving specifically to your question on medical -- or medical device marketplace what we would say is, we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19. In the UK, where you're seeing other markets return more than 90% to 100% range, although, we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter. Not only as we see more vaccinations, but of course the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our medical device platforms. If you take a look at vision surgery up 11%, if you take a look at our EP business up 26%, our surgery business was well up in the double-digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or endomechanical. Orthopedics particularly large joints, we saw lags slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed-bearing cementless options as well. So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement performance in our medical device sector, as we head through the remainder of the year. Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing. Joe Wolk : Sure. Thanks Larry. Thanks for the question. And as usual you have all the numbers at the ready there. So I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story is that I would say, on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams and each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after. And that's really how we're looking at it. As we -- we have many great opportunities -- and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 million. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year. But right now, we thought that was the best course of action to solidify the long term. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I want to focus on two areas. The first one is in Vision Care. And I'm trying to parse through, how much of the delivery is easy comp share loss and/or gain and just recovery in elective procedures? And then I want to sort of put the second one on the table, which is, it sounds like orthopedics, particularly, is lagging. Do you have a view on when that may recover? And just more broadly speaking, is there a pattern to segment recovery that you anticipate throughout the year? Thank you. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, in Vision Care overall, we think our performance was solid. We have seen the contact lens business in the surgery business be significantly impacted over the course of 2020. We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing. And we think we've seen, definitely, an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comments. And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multi-focal and contact lenses, and the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and share gains through the year. Regarding orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business, growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are, perhaps, the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, we're lagging somewhat. But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals and we see systems work their way through backlogs and, of course, in our business being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters. Thank you. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Thank you and good morning. Joe, I was wondering if you could comment on how your 2021 EPS guidance might look if you exclude the impact of COVID reserve release and the spending on the vaccine, just wanted to kind of maybe get a sense for EPS for the true underlying business. And then I'll just state my -- the second topic I'd love you to comment on as well is -- just wanted to get your latest thinking on the potential to shift to more of a for-profit model as we potentially exit the emergent phase. I realize it might be a little early to talk about that, but just wanted to get your latest thinking on the potential to shift to more -- to shift post the emergent phase of this pandemic. Thank you very much. Joe Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the questions, Bob. With respect to the impact of, I'd say, COVID-19 vaccine investing, in the quarter, it was, let's call it, between $0.05 and $0.10 for the quarter. I'm not overly concerned about that because, as you heard from Paul, we are going through the rigor of the scientific reviews. It appears that there is a very path forward that we'll find out about here in the next couple of days. And we're going to do all we can to make sure that that important solution to address the global pandemic gets back into the marketplace. So, we think we'll recover that, even in the not-for-profit model. With respect to pricing and dynamics, I think you're probably correct in your initial assessment that it's a bit early. But let me turn it over to Joaquin to give you some thoughts that we have on that topic. Joaquin Duato : Thanks for the question. Our focus from the beginning in this pandemic was to be a partner in addressing this humanitarian crisis. And as a consequence in order to make sure that we facilitate access globally, we decided to go with a not-for-profit model. Our focus now remains to be able to be a participant in addressing this pandemic. And once this pandemic is over, there will be time to discuss different options. But today our focus is to address this pandemic and be an important partner in making an impact globally in stopping COVID-19. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Bob. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a follow-up to Bob's question just on the vaccine and just how revenues and expenses flow through the P&L. Just wanted to make sure or sanity check the 100 million doses by mid-year in the US. 100 million more by the end of 2021, 200 million doses in Europe, for instance, are those guaranteed contracts? And just in terms of the risk-sharing model and the not-for-profit model, I just wanted to make sure that your downside is protected in terms of expenses going forward already incurred and where those contracts sit? Joe Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the follow-up Josh. You know as you can imagine, it is very fluid. But there's nothing in the guidance today that should give analysts or investors concern about any downside with respect to this. Again, we're hope -- we're cautiously hopeful that there is a very viable path forward. We'll learn a lot more in the next couple of days through the regulators. We'll let the process play out, but investors should feel very comfortable with our EPS guidance to protect against any downside that may be envisioned, although I don't see that as likely at this point. Chris DelOrefice : Yes. Maybe just one add-on as it relates to Bob's question and Josh your question too. I mean just keep in mind when you look at our underlying performance right, pharm is a segment which was less impacted top-line strong above market. And we continue to improve margins there as well. And you did see margin improvement as well in consumer. So while there's certainly many impacts from COVID year-over-year, I think when you really look underneath the underlying results there's strength both on the top-line and bottom-line that's factored when you look at this year. Joe Wolk : That's a good point, Chris. And I think this is going to be a choppy year so we have to look selectively at year-on-year comps. And if you just look at, let's call, what was a normal quarter at least as we knew it back in the first quarter of 2019 you look at our respective businesses. You have -- consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again that suggests a strong underlying business. Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5% and medical devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison. But I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have as you heard in our commentary many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. So across all three parts of our business, I think, there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong. You couple that with the investment we continue to make in R&D at elevated levels, I would hope folks feel really good about not just our performance of today but our future performance on the horizon. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question was, do you have any thoughts on potential corporate tax increases in the US as well as potential drug pricing reform? And then second question is on Cilta-Cel. I know you're expecting approval this year. Where do you expect it to fit into the treatment paradigm, if it is approved? Did you expect CAR-Ts to gain wider usage over time? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Great, Louise. Thanks for the questions. I will address tax reform as best I can. Obviously that's a fluid situation. Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either. And I can give you one example in one industry and that's Johnson & Johnson where when tax reform was passed in 2017 we committed to increasing our investment in the US by 15% over the upcoming four years versus the preceding four years. We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the US over that four year period. And that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the US economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 act. So, I think when you look at where the US sits with respect to OECD countries, right now we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit toward the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. So, I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive, that the US becomes a source of innovation across all industries. And we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year where many US-based companies have stepped up. Joaquin, let me turn it to you to -- just the other items. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. So, with regards to pricing reforms in the US, that was your question Louise. So we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. And in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a pay-for in another budget reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value that innovation -- it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. Now, we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience an reduction in the out-of-pocket costs and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines, and in that sense we continue to support that type of reform. I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio with 11 products of more than $1 billion, and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline. In the -- in 2020, we invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about two times what we invest in sales and marketing. So, we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative and that in that context the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well-positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our very broadly diversified portfolio. So, about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed in the first quarter of 2020 that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progressed on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T, and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young and fit patients may have BCMA CAR-T as a first-line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative. Paul? Paul Stoffels : Yes. From the beginning, we selected BCMA CAR-T based on its double binding and that has yield a superior profile with -- in the high 90s overall response rates as well as very high MRD-negativity rates and lasting effect. And so, we think this CAR-T is very strongly positioned in the market and hope to get approval in the second half of the year. Louise Chen : Great. Thank you, Paul. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please? Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. I have two questions. One is really on the device business. And I think Joe you alluded to this when you were talking about growth comparisons to 2019. But you know there was still a COVID impact in Q1. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you know, how Q1 sort of shaped up as you work through the month. Did you see a strong recovery in March in the device side of things? And do you feel like -- and this might be an ambiguous and kind of difficult question to truly answer. But I guess do you feel like the worst is behind us even regardless of how vaccinations continue to roll out? And what variants might do? And then I have one vaccine follow-up. Alex Gorsky : Hey, Danielle, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for your question. We do there expect to see improving trends in our medical device arena. If we take a look at the first quarter, there was some irregularity just based upon what we are seeing with the virus on a global basis in January versus February and March. But overall, it's clear to us that we're seeing improving trends. And as Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, we would expect that just given year-on-year comps plus what we're seeing underlying both in the United States and Europe in terms of procedure scheduling, confidence in returning to the hospitals and overall surgical volumes. We would expect those to improve through the second and third quarter of this year. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the vaccine side of things, as it relates to manufacturing and what are the alternatives for the volumes that were supposed to be manufactured out of Emergent, if in a worst-case scenario Emergent is prevented from being able to produce for the next few months? Alex Gorsky : Thank you, Danielle. Look as Paul said, our goal remains ensuring that all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets our high-quality standards and at the same time that we secure Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at the Emergent Bayview facility. At this time, as we continue in discussions with the FDA, it is premature to speculate on any potential impact that this may have on our timing of our vaccine deliveries. So we will expect to work with the FDA, to work this inspection this -- to close this inspection this week and then we will work with the FDA and Emergent to address those inspections findings. But at this time, it would be premature to speculate on any potential impact that this could happen our delivery timing. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks. And then just real quick to build on Alex's comment maybe just to give you a little bit of color. We're obviously looking at procedures closely surgical procedures imaging as well. Diagnostics is actually outpacing surgical procedures accelerated through the quarter. It's almost in line with where we were pre-pandemic. So that's a positive sign, although the situation of course remains fluid. And then many important procedures such as colorectal again sequentially improved through the quarter and actually grew year-over-year. So again, we're seeing positive signs across. And I think you saw that in our results and pockets of our businesses advanced surgery for example growing over 14%. So we're continuing to look at everything. The situation remains fluid, but there's definitely positive signs on the trends that we're seeing. Thanks, Danielle. Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much. So I've got one sort of utilization-related question on procedure trends and then I have a follow-up for Alex, if I could on digital strategy. So first, device is up 8.8%, stronger than The Street was expecting. The mix also a bit stronger than expected on advanced surgery and maybe a little bit slower as it's come up in the Q&A here than expected in knees which you mentioned Alex is a couple of times being more deferrable. The question is should we read through this as a bit of a shift to higher acuity procedures at least within your portfolio? And then maybe how should we see the recent rise in hospitalizations potentially affecting the trajectory of recovery over these procedures over the next months and quarters? And then as I mentioned, I have one follow-up on digital. Alex Gorsky : Sure, Matt. Thanks a lot for the question. Look Matt, overall, I wouldn't read too much into just these recent results regarding a significant shift overall in our portfolio. I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our orthopedics portfolio and our vision care portfolio. But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how elective they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look overall, if we look at our underlying trends not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long-term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our medical device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area VELYS as well as our ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our EndoMech, our energy business here too we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our vision care portfolio. And of course, longer-term the significant opportunity that we see in digital surgery that team has continued to make very solid progress. And we're excited about the long-term prospects there as well. So, now overall, we see a lot of opportunity across our medical device portfolio. Matt Miksic : That's great. And maybe just to segue on your second point there about digital. You mentioned robotic knee system's on track. Monarch, obviously leading the market in robotic-assisted lung and Ottava is sort of tracking through clinicals and validation. The question is, is what else -- you've built out this portfolio artificial -- in some artificial intelligence robotic surgery applications and technology, what are the white spaces? Where else do you see investments within digital? Alex Gorsky : Sure. Well, look I -- we believe that we're in a very, very early innings of digital, Matt. And first of all, if we just look at the overall penetration rate of digital surgery, it's about 10% in the United States. It's just a couple of percent on a global basis. And so we think, if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long-term. As you mentioned our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look we're building this for the decades, we're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that one can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that two that's differentiated; and three that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think long-term can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. And as we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that -- all too often patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify for example lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune-type agents locally. And how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining pharma, medical device some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think, it exemplifies, kind of, our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. Rob, we'll take our last question now. Operator : Yes. The questions come from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Recently there's been some new post-marketing data reported for Xeljanz and the FDA pushed out the PDUFA dates of several JAK inhibitors. You guys are developing a pan-JAK inhibitor for IBD. Would just love your latest perspective on the risk-benefit profile the category here and next steps in your development program? And then just as a follow-up just wanted to confirm that you're on track to supply one billion doses of your COVID-19 vaccine this year. Thank you. Paul Stoffels : So thank you for the question on immunology. Look, I'm not going to comment on the safety of the oral JAK inhibitors. What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our three existing assets; Symfony, Stelara and Tremfya. Stelara and Tremfya had very strong quarters with close to 40% growth in Tremfya and 15% in Stelara. In Stelara, we continue to grow share in GI both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And Tremfya is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications PSA and PSO and it's continued to gain share in both areas. Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned one, we have two in Phase 2. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody-mediated with very rare diseases that could create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025 too. Joe Wolk : Yes. Maybe Terence just to pile on to what Joaquin outlined there with the strength of our pipeline. So in pharmaceuticals, specifically, we're looking at 10 new filings that could be new products or indications in 2021, 13 in 2022 and 26 in 2023. So you can see that R&D investment incrementally paying off. With respect to your second question regarding supply, I want to be respectful of the process by which the regulators are going through. We are remediating what we need to remediate. We think that will lend itself to a positive outcome and should put us in a position to meet all of our contractual commitments as they stand today. But let's be respectful of the process and let that play out. We're going to do all we can and provide that effort. As you know and as you've heard in the press we do have some of our best personnel on the -- on-site at Emergent. So they're benefiting from our expertise and we should know more in the next couple of days. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Terence. Chris DelOrefice : And thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex just for some brief closing remarks. Alex Gorsky : Well let me end where I began, first of all, by thanking all of you for your insightful questions and your ongoing support; two and also by thanking all of our associates at Johnson & Johnson almost 140,000 who have been working 24/7, particularly, over the last 15 months during this pandemic period. We appreciate your ongoing interest and your support and look forward to updating you at our next quarterly call. Thank you very much and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded.  If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Chris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the Second Quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceuticals, Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health, and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medical Devices.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson and Johnson web site at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes Forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results, to differ materially from those projected.  In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook, is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date.  A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures, utilized for today's discussion, to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.J&J.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments.  Joe will provide insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment, and will outline our updated guidance, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine for 2021. Then we will begin the Q&A session with each of the segment leaders providing a brief update on their respective businesses.  The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes.  Now, let's move to the second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 27.1% versus the second quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 23% as currency had a positive impact of 4.1 points. In the U.S., sales increased 24.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 29.5%.  Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 20.9%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 8.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 23.8% worldwide, 25.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings.  For the quarter, net earnings were $6.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.35, versus diluted earnings per share of $1.36 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.48, representing increases of 49% and 48.5% respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you.  Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and increased 9.2%, with increases in the U.S. of 12.4% and growth of 6.3% outside of the U.S.  Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 10%. Year-to-date adjusted operational growth was 3.3% and is more reflective of performance given the quarterly fluctuations of COVID-19 impacts.  The over-the-counter medicines grew 8.9% globally, driven by strong growth in ZYRTEC, due to both the timing of and increased incidents in the allergy season. Digestive Health grew double-digits driven by U.S. PEPCID, new SKU stocking in the Club Channel, coupled with share growth and increased COVID-19 related healthcare professional recommendations for the hydration benefit offering, ORSL, in the Asia Pacific region.  The skin health beauty franchise grew 12.9% globally, with the U.S. increasing 23% and OUS increasing 1.4%. Skin health beauty outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to divestitures. Worldwide growth was driven by market recovery in key markets, increased U.S. stocking for new products, and comparisons to COVID -19 related destocking dynamics. NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance in the U.S., primarily due to market recovery, new product innovation, and higher stocking due to the NEUTROGENA rapid firming product launch, partially offset by competitive pressures. OGX and [Indiscernible] growth was driven by share gains and market growth in hair care.  Oral Care grew 2.5% globally due to strong OUS performance for LISTERINE, reflecting accelerated category and increased demand from continued successful promotional campaigns. Divestitures in the quarter, negatively impacted results by 310 basis points.  The Baby Care franchise grew by 5% as a result of market recovery and OUS strength in Johnson's and AVEENO Baby in eCommerce. Wound Care delivered strong growth of 13.4%, driven by U.S. market growth with increased consumer behaviors focused on preparedness and infection prevention, and seasonal stocking versus prior year COVID-19 destocking dynamics.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.6 billion grew 13.6%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 12.2% and OUS with sales increasing by 15.4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 14.1%. Global sales in the quarter included a $164 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  Additionally, as a reminder for comparison purposes, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 300 to 350 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above market levels.  Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 17%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 30.5% driven by increased market growth and share gains, with U.S. share increasing roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 8 points in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA was up 36.8% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to share gains, continued global expansion into new markets, and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and nearly 3 points in psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with growth of 21.5%. DARZALEX continued its exceptional performance trajectory growing 53.8%, driven by share gains and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to grow share across all lines of therapy, with nearly 4 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA also continued its global momentum with growth of 73.7% in the quarter, driven by market share, which increased by nearly 2 points across indications, and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication.  IMBRUVICA grew 12.5% globally due to volume gains driven by our market-leading share, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. to novel oral competition and a market that remains slightly depressed due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio had strong double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular, metabolism, other declined 7.3% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 1.8% in XARELTO due to continued demand strength.  Lastly, our pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved growth of 8.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 11.9% and UPTRAVI growth of 9.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment.  Worldwide medical devices sales of $7 billion grew 57.2%, with the U.S. increasing 77.2% and OUS increasing 41.9%, primarily due to the recovery of procedures from COVID-19 restrictions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020, coupled with the success of recently launched products and commercial activities across the business.  Selling days had a minor positive impact on growth this quarter. We expect the full-year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, to be minimal. Given the extent of the procedure disruption from COVID-19 in 2020, I thought it may be helpful to provide context for our current quarter performance versus the second quarter of 2019.  Worldwide Medical Devices grew about 7% versus Q2 2019, with 8 of our 11 billion-dollar platforms showing growth versus 2019. The pace of market recovery in knees, spine, and vision-surgical, has been slower than the other markets in which we compete as these procedures are perceived to be more deferrable by patients.  Geographically, both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific markets surpassed Q2 2019. While EMEA and Latin America markets have been slower to recover, and Q2 results remained at or below 2019 levels. Looking at results for each of our platforms, Interventional Solutions delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 71.3% and strong double-digit growth versus the second quarter of 2019. Electrophysiology reinforced our global market share leadership position growing 74.4%, driven by recovery in the market coupled with our market expansion activities, the strength of our broad-based portfolio, and new products.  Worldwide orthopaedics delivered 48.6% growth versus the prior year, driven primarily by market recovery and success of newer product launches. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 24.8%, reflecting market recovery, strength of our comprehensive portfolio, and success of newer product introductions.  This quarter, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of products with the launch of a next-generation Variable Angle Clavicle Plate System designed to enhance plate to bone fit on a broad range of patients and simplify implant selection for the surgeon.  And we launched an advanced tibial nailing system, designed to provide a more stable implant solution and create efficiency within the healthcare system by streamlining instrumentation across our portfolio. Worldwide hips grew 68.1% this quarter, driven by market recovery, our continued leadership position in the anterior approach, demand for the ACTIS Stem, aided by our other enabling technologies, such as VELYS Hip Navigation and innovative commercial programs focused on expanding coverage and access for hip fracture patients in parts of Europe and Latin America.  Knees returned to growth this quarter, increasing 94.6% globally, primarily due to market recovery. Results reflect continued COVID-19 challenges and the related impact on procedures in markets like India, Japan, and Australia, and other dynamics, including faster recovery trends in primary knee procedures compared to revisions.  This quarter, we began commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and ATTUNE knee platform, including the second half 2021 launch of ATTUNE Cementless Fixed Bearing Knee with AFFIXIUM 3D Printed Technology, will enhance our portfolio and competitiveness as procedures continue to recover. Spine returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 51.7%, reflecting market recovery and positive impact from recently launched products, SYMFONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT, as well as strategic partnerships which further enhance our offerings, such as the X-Pac Expandable Cage.  Advanced Surgery grew 44.3% versus prior - year. In addition to the positive impact of procedure recovery, Biosurgery delivered sales growth of 48% and positive share momentum driven by new products and commercial strategies to expand market penetration and adoption. Endocutters and Energy both grew around 40% globally, primarily due to procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion activities, partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S.  We also achieved a significant milestone within the quarter with our Monarch robotic platform, surpassing a 100 customers and 8,000 procedures. General surgery grew 67.8% globally, with Wound Closure growing 50.1% globally, driven by recovery in the markets, continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including our Plus sutures and STRATAFIX Barb suture family, and a change in channel inventory levels in the U.S., contributing about 6 points to global growth.  Global General Surgery sales were positively impacted by 23 points due to a prior-year unfavorable pricing adjustment in the U.S., we communicated last year. Worldwide Vision grew 66% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery. U.S. Contact Lens growth of 73.6% reflects the strength of our market-leading ACUVUE Portfolio. Commercial initiatives, such as our Prioritize Your Eyes campaign, launched to raise awareness around the importance of routine screenings, new products, including early success from ACUVUE Multifocal, and an inventory build contributing about 5 points. Growth outside the U.S. of 43.1% reflects market recovery and strength of ACUVUE 1-DAY, and recent Asia-Pacific ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH Beauty launch.  Global Surgical Vision delivered growth of a 115.8%, driven by market recovery and positive momentum related to new products like TECNIS Eyhance, TECNIS Synergy, which both launched this year in the U.S. market, and VERITAS, our next-generation phacoemulsification device. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the Second Quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.48 reflects a reported increase of 48.5% and an operational increase of 44.9%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved by 340 basis points, primarily driven by the recovery in Medical Device from prior-year COVID-19 related inventory impacts and fixed cost deleveraging. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins improved 110 basis points due to the recovery of Medical Device sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.6% of sales this quarter.  The $3.4 billion investment was a 25% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. The Other Income and Expense Line showed Net income of $488 million in the Second Quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of 24 million in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced litigation-related items, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on securities.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate declined from 8% in the second quarter of 2020 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by a one-time tax benefit the Company recognized in the second quarter 2021, resulting from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded additional tax benefits related to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform, which benefited the 2020 tax rate.  Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 14.8% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for additional details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment.  In the second quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 29.1% to 33.4%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment.  Medical Devices margin improved from 1.2% to 28.6% driven primarily by overall expense leveraging, resulting from the COVID-19 related sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 380 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program, partially offset by increased investments in brand marketing expenses.  Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 450 basis points, primarily driven by increased research and development investment, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine net costs, and general portfolio progression. Moving to important developments, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business. We continue to make positive progress advancing our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and therapies. As we've shared previously, we are rigorous and focusing on differentiated, transformational medical innovation.  In the quarter, we announced our decision not to continue the collaboration and license agreement for Cusatuzumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody that targets CD70. The decision is based upon Janssen's review of all available data and in consideration of the evolving standard of care for the treatment of AML. We received EU approval for PONVORY in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and also U.S. approval of RYBREVANT for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor Exon 20 Insertion Mutations.  In addition, we completed our EU filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third NME approval this year. Within our Medical Device portfolio, we continue to make meaningful advancements in our innovation pipeline, launching 17 major first-country launches in the first half of 2021, including 8 products this quarter. As noted earlier, we received FDA approval and launched TECNIS Synergy and TECNIS Synergy Toric II intraocular lenses in the U.S.  These are next-generation presbyopia correcting lenses, and deliver the widest range of continuous vision, and the best near vision among leading PC IOLs. Finally, within the surgery business, the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue S sealer launched in the U.S., expanding the Ethicon advanced bipolar energy portfolio.  That concludes the sales P&L and pipeline highlights for Johnson & Johnson 's Second Quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Chris. Good morning. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter, and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy, and enjoyable summer. As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson 's businesses remain leaders, or are better positioned, within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all three segments beat your expectations.  We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond. Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success. And guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world. Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship.  We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG Investor Update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders. I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website. Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, with approximately $8 billion year-to-date.  We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.  Our dividend remains a key priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business, while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers. Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide shares will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session. I will now move directly to providing the update to our full-year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance.  For clarity, I will first comment on our core business revenue and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect our base business defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine to remain strong.  Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance.  We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in Medical Devices, Consumer Health, as well as within other oncology in Pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9% to 10%, or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion.  While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18, and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates, resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points.  This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5%, or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020. Now, a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full-year 2021 guidance.  Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the healthcare industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace.  Chris shared earlier that we recorded vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed a $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose.  The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net cost incurred, as well as, volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter.  Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2nd, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved an expansion of our facility in the Netherlands increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance.  The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility under the Emergency Use Authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent.  Now, I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021-2022. It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine, given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variance. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least eight months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variance. At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future-year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years.  Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint. Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term. We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses, while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income net expense.  Moving to interest expense. Based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of 100 million to 200 million. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain one-time benefits realized in the first half of the year. The results of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance.  We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6%, or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call. Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65, increasing 20.2%. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.  I am now pleased and want to thank our worldwide shares, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon, and Ashley McEvoy, for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time-to-time. Before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut, and Ashley, each to provide a brief business segment update and qualitative outlook for the remainder of 2021. Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Jennifer Taubert : Well, thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth.  As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic area.  We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, and ERLEADA, our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA, our pulmonary hypertension medicines, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, and INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio. Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price.  This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. It's important to note, we continue to be a trough investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and builds the foundation for our long-term growth. During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first by-specific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.  This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval, and this was by the FDA in March, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada.  We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, Cilta-Cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. A marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency.  We anticipate FDA approval of Cilta-Cel as our third NME approval later this year. In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations; as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder; and as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter, the FDA -approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. I'm proud of our Pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth.  Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline, and our long-term growth outlook. We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest, and we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline, and the details behind the breadth of our auto antibody program that came through our acquisition of MOMENTA last year.  I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today. Thibaut, I will now turn it over to you. Thibaut Mongon : Alright. Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year we focused on execution across our broad-based portfolio, delivered solid results, growing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance. The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally endorsed brands, and advancing our digital capabilities, continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance.  Our Consumer Health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for Acquisitions and Divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis.  And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we've seen in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our two strongholds such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and NICORETTE in OTC, or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, and OGX in Skin Health. In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby, and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. Now, if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working.  We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results; well balanced, both in terms of categories we compete in, and in terms of geographic presence. And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements, have delivered to plan.  Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, or another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set.  And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile, while at the same time investing to grow the topline, launching new products, and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks, and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021.  So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and market in which we compete. And now, let me hand over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley? Ashley McEvoy : Thank you. Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning. Thanks for joining. Let me just begin with across JNJ, how privileged we feel to work in healthcare because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of Health for Humanity and we're propelled by our MedTech aspiration to re-imagine the future of health today, in three ways. One is innovating across the continuum of patient care, two is prioritizing and modernizing health, and three is promoting health equity and wellness.  We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. This quarter, MedTech delivered sales of $7 billion, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020 and, as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum.  Eight of our $11 billion MedTech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019. And quarter one '21 share trends show, that we have maintained or gained share in ten of these platforms. We have an exciting pipeline, and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in the first half of 2021. This is the highest number of first-half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products which will strengthen our core like TECNIS SYNERGY, our most advanced premier intraocular lens in surgical vision; and the ENSEAL X1 Curved Tissue Sealer, a next-generation advanced energy solution in our surgery franchise. We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management, where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics, and illuminal, interventional and vision. Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing, and potentially life-saving, in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We're extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering, continues to progress its key development milestones. We also recognize that the digitization of healthcare is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China to develop the virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. In the first 4 months of launch, 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7500 patients. It's no surprise our Electrophysiology business in China is so strong. And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the UK modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of PLUS SUTURES as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and are necessary cost to the healthcare system. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, healthcare capacity, and the ability to manage through surges, as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to our purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. Their resilience, agility, and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, build stronger relationships with our customers and patients, and defined a clear vision of our future. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, Jennifer, thanks, Thibaut and thanks, Ashley. Let's now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instruction]. Please limit your questions to one question only. Your first question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen : Hi. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for taking my question. My question is about the global surge in COVID. There has been a surge despite high rates of vaccinations in many places in the world. So just curious, how do you think this could impact your business in the second half '21 if it continues to get worse? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Louise. I think it's probably best maybe that you hear from both Ashley and Jennifer on this specific perspective. Ashley? Ashley McEvoy : Yeah, Louise. I would say -- listen, we're encouraged by, quite frankly, several things. How -- the ability that hospitals can manage through capacity in surges and labor, as well as, obviously, the vaccination efforts around the world. And just the patient, there's a significant backlog of care. If I look at the UK, my goodness, there's like 5,000,000 patients waiting for medical interventions, 400,000 of those folks waiting for surgery for the past 12 months. But as we know, it's not going to be linear. We do know hospital systems in the United States are starting to delay care right now. I think quarter-to-quarter, it will improve, but it will never be a linear line. Jennifer Taubert : I can add in. On the Pharma side, most of our core categories are pretty much back to the pre-COVID level, the exception on that actually being CLL. But we're really seeing strength coming back, for example, in the United States and in Europe. And we do anticipate some modest ups and downs, but I think our team really did an extraordinary job last year of partnering with healthcare systems, and physicians, and patients to make sure that they could get on and stay on the therapies that they need. So our outlook for the rest of the year really remains strong for our sector, regardless of what happens with emerging variants and any continued blips as it relates to COVID. Joseph Wolk : I'd also add, Louise, that I think we've got to really tip our cap to the healthcare administrators, health professionals across the globe. We're in a much better position to handle a pandemic than we were of March of last year. And so, certainly, that would have, I would say, a favorable impact on whatever unfavorable events may occur. We really need to recognize just the great resiliency and agility that those individuals have shown as well. Chris DelOrefice : Thibaut, do you want to share a little bit about consumer and the momentum you see there, and maybe a couple of the category dynamics as well? Thibaut Mongon : Now, we see strong momentum across our broad-based portfolio as I told you earlier this morning, Our categories will continue to be impacted by market level conditions, seasonality. Having said that, we have proven, over the past 18 months, is that our broad-based portfolio, in terms of both categories and geographies, allowed us to weather whatever external conditions happen. And we expect continued momentum into the back half of the year. Chris DelOrefice : Great, terrific. Thanks, Louise. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, just a finer point on the quarter-over-quarter improvement in device, as you mentioned. Do you expect the continued acceleration relative to 2019 in Q3 and Q4? And Joe, could you just help us think about the operational ex - COVID vaccine sales in EPS cadence in the second half, given the easier comp in Q3 and the extra week in Q4 2020? Thanks for taking the questions. Ashley McEvoy : Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. I think what you heard is, in quarter 2 we were up about 7% relative to 2019, and that was pretty broad based. I'd say 3 out of 4 of our franchises posted growth versus 2019. Orthopedics was down about a point. We were up in the United States about a point. Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2, really due to some of the slower moving countries like Japan and India in opening up in COVID. When I think about quarter 3 and quarter 4, I do expect continued momentum. You'll recall last year, we were down about 3% in quarter 3 versus 2019, and we were down about 1.5% in quarter 4 2020 versus '19. I do expect continued progress. I expect Orthopedics to go positive. I expect Vision to accelerate, given a lot of the new product launches. As we've discussed, we think the category is going to be high double-digit. We expect to be more in the high single-digit at the end of this year versus 2019. Joseph Wolk : Yeah. And Larry, with respect to your question on guidance overall, I think I'd almost have to mirror a little bit what Ashley had said, the comparables were going to be most pronounced for the second quarter. There will be a little bit of benefit as we look into the third and fourth quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter. But I really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those that which we don't lead. In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation; new approvals, new offerings that offer better healthcare solutions. That's how we're thinking about it. From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top-line growth, and EPS growth, that will approach 20%. We think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised to the upside as well. We want to make sure that we don't only deliver strong results in the current quarter or the next 2 quarters, but really in the middle and back half of this decade as well. We think we're very well-positioned to do that. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess my question is just on the core revenue growth guidance. I think you've raised it twice this year. I'm just looking for a little bit more color of what's driving the upside versus your expectation? Is this more device versus pharma or consumer? Is it share gain versus overall market growth? Other geographies there standing out? I'm just trying to get a sense of like really what would've been the real upsides versus your initial expectations? If I can just slip a second quick one in, I think you mentioned the Pharma margins were impacted by increased investments in 2Q. Should we be thinking about that as a one-time event with the COVID vaccine expenses, et cetera, or are we entering kind of a sustained period of R&D ramp here or where we could see with some of those margins under pressure? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Chris, let me take a stab at that and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other Company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold; would there be new variants? And so we took a, what I thought was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations at the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. What we did learn, and it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams, just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting the businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it a goodwill factor, with respect to how we're approaching our business today. With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing, and really what we all take great pride in is there's not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again, across all three segments that really positions us well. Last year, you might recall we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty, and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6 month comparator. So we feel very well-positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. I don't know, Jennifer, if there's anything else you want to add. Jennifer Taubert : What I'd add in, we really focused on being a transformational medical innovator and we know that we do disproportionately invest in R&D versus the other areas of our business. If you take a look at the strength of our pipeline as well as the continued progression, we are seeing more assets transitioning into those later stages of development that require additional costs. And as Joe had indicated earlier, the beauty right now of the strength that we have for the business is it's allowing us to invest for those future waves of innovation. We feel real good about the level of investment for R&D in the Pharm group. Joseph Wolk : And just so nobody has a takeaway we're only investing in pharmaceuticals, we're investing in digital surgery capabilities that Ashley mentioned, we're investing in the consumer space, connecting with the consumer in more digital enabled ways. So it's really across the board. Chris DelOrefice : Yeah, Chris, and I would just add. I guess on the Medical Device side, actually alluded to the amount of innovation we've seen in the quarter. So I think some of the strength you're seeing on the top line is clearly the result of the focus on bringing strong innovation to market. We're well-poised over a two-year period to deliver nearly 40, what we will call major new product launches, which is significant increase from where we've been. I think you're seeing that coupled with the recovery in MD results and then clearly in Pharm. Double-digit growth year-to-date, strong above-market performance. I think those investments are paying off, and focus on innovation will be a core focus of ours. Thanks for the question, Chris. Rob, next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Thank you very much. Just a quick one for me. For MedTech, thank you for giving that 7% number versus 2019. I was just curious, is that a reported number or is that a number that adjusts for currency? And then one other thing I'd love a quick comment on is on the COVID -tied questions. Just curious, especially on the the Device side, Ashley, is there a major geography right now where increasing levels of hospitalization have you particularly concerned or are we not quite at that stage yet? Chris DelOrefice : I guess, first real quick, Bob. The 7% is an adjusted OPS growth number. Just for consistency, so you understand underlying organic. Ashley McEvoy : Yeah. And Bob, just to -- again, thanks for the question. Again, we've had the benefit to learn from how this virus manifests around the world, starting with China. Asia is a region that is above 2019 in terms of procedure volume, clearly really driven by China. We've seen that Japan 's in lockdown. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States. We actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA, with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K.. And then U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down. Medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May that went positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line, given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S., like Florida, like Michigan in the midwest. So, again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this. I have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please. Operator : The next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, I was hoping to just -- as we're thinking about 2022 and you are encouraging the street to exclude COVID vaccine revenues from our forecast. I was hoping just to better understand the COVID-19 vaccine margin impact in 2021. It seems to be margin dilutive, but how we should be thinking about the core businesses margin for a baseline for a great 2022 forecast. Joseph Wolk : Yeah. Josh, I would say at this point, it's really a minimal, in terms of both the segment, as well as, certainly Johnson & Johnson 's margin profile. Thus far through 6 months, it's been dilutive, again, to a minimal amount. We expect that dilution to reverse itself in the second half of this year. But again, being a not-for-profit, there's no material impact on EPS despite the 2.5 billion revenue estimate that we've provided earlier today. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Josh. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please? Operator : Next question is from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Terrence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess the first one is just on the duration of protection with the vaccines. Joe, you touched on this a little bit. But maybe just, what's your perspective on how often a booster might be required here, and then can you remind us the timing of your 2-dose Phase 3 trial? And then Jennifer, would love any more details you could provide on the DARZALEX subcu-conversion and the IMBRUVICA competitor dynamics that you mentioned. Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Terrence, thanks for the questions. I would say in terms of the booster, whether it's needed or not, I think we should really defer to health officials around the world as to what that call will be. We do like the durability of at least 8 months. For our vaccine, we think that's better than some of the other vaccines that are out there, not to disparage them in any manner whatsoever, but health official still have not made any type of decisions on when or if a booster will be needed, so we'll just defer to them when more data is collected. Jennifer Taubert : Perfect. So then, as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX, we saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter. Also, the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through, and our 6th indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business, already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form, and that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. We're very, very confident in the uptake and this is really providing significant benefits from patients going from multiple-hour infusions down to a 3-5 minute injection. A lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that in the U.S.. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patients starts are still down a little bit and CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. but we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains a number 1 prescribed treatment in CLL, and Relapsed/Refractory MCL, and also Waldenstrom. It's a number one BTKI wherever they are prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL, and a safety profile that's supported by over 5 years of follow-up in clinical experience. We believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA and will continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward. Joseph Wolk : And Terrence, with respect to your question on the 2-dose study for the vaccine, we would expect that data to be late Q3, early Q4 at this point. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Terence, appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Matt Miksic : Hey, thanks so much for taking our question. Just one -- just quick follow-up. I know that there were some questions early on on the tone of the market and COVID and trends for the back half of the year. But just to clarify, specifically for Ashley, the third quarter, for those businesses that are in the past, the Med Device businesses that have been seasonally off, down slightly, flattish from Q2 to Q3. Is that the pattern when you talk about improving momentum? And is that the pattern we should see a normal seasonal pattern or is the momentum you're describing something that would actually take this -- some of those businesses up sequentially? And I have one follow-up if I could. Ashley McEvoy : Yeah, Matt. I think -- thank you for the question. I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some bookends like our Electrophysiology business, our AFib, treating cardiac ablation has recovered very expeditiously. And that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other bookend, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are -- procedure volumes are still below 2019. We would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace. It's really the pace of vaccinations, pace at hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and manage through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patients sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that JNJ has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts, and data, and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seek ed care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week, we take four steps forward and maybe a step back. Thank you. Matt Miksic : Super. And then just one on Vision if I could. You mentioned the approval of Synergy in the U.S. I know it's been out. This is the presbyopia correcting IOL that's been out for a while in Europe. Just wondering if you can tell us what that has done for the European business, what the response has been, and how you're thinking about that mapping over to the U.S.? Thanks. Ashley McEvoy : Sure. We've seen really strong performance of the TECNIS Synergy in EMEA. We are growing market share in EMEA in vision surgery and that market's had a lot of available premium intraocular lenses. We're pleased to bring that technology to the United States. We just launched in quarter 2, there's been very good pickup. It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning, with our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier, the VERITAS. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in Monofocals and the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. Surgical Vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus 2019 in OUS. And so I expect that that should get -- have the U.S. start to pick up more in the back half of the year. Matt Miksic : Thanks, Ashley. Appreciate it. Chris DelOrefice : Matt, thanks for the question. Rob, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. Two of them. One, could you sort of give us a little bit of update and color on the ORTHOTAXY adoption. You did provide some statistics on MONARCH, but anything else that you can sort of add in that bucket? And then my second question is, I might be reading the tea leaves a little bit here, but you sounded maybe just a little bit stronger on the idea or concept of M&A. Am I interpreting that correctly? Ashley McEvoy : Thanks, Joanne. I'll start and then I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a bit about M&A and some of the other businesses as well. I would say we were very encouraged. We've had about 750 on-hand demonstrations with our VELYS knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things.  The value of the system, smaller footprint, the image's interoperative capabilities, and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams, the workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. It's new. We just got approval also in Australia, so we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that were assessing and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes, so stay tuned on that. And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say for MedTech point of view. You're seeing, we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A, really behind getting into iHealth. Getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it standard of care changing technology. It's like new ways in ablation. For liver ablation was the first indication. Right now we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors -- bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses and drug delivery using Monarch. As well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. Again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to. But I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a little bit about M&A. Jennifer Taubert : One of the things that helps us be really successful here is that we're truly agnostic to the source of innovation. So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It' not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in [Indiscernible] we made the acquisition of MOMENTA, we brought in TARIS as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic atrophy and age-related macular degeneration from Hemera. And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technologies in our key areas of focus. And many times that's coming from our internal labs. Many times it's also coming externally. Our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front. Thibaut Mongon : And in Consumer Health, I would say that we have a very strong portfolio of iconic brands that we continue to develop very quickly. Mostly, we continuously scan the market for opportunities to find either new go-to-market models or close gaps in our portfolio. But if you look at the acquisitions we have made over the past couple of years, we are really pleased with their performance. All of them, whether it's in self-care or skin health, are performing well. And that's very encouraging for the future. Joseph Wolk : And, Joanne, I'll just say you're going to force me to review the transcripts in maybe more detail than I usually do. I didn't think our language changed much. We always remain pretty aggressive when it comes to rigorous portfolio management; making sure that we're making the most of the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities that we have, and we just got to find deals that really fit the financial construct in a disciplined way. Whether it's in MedTech, Pharmaceuticals, or Consumer, we look across the board really monthly, if not more often, at opportunities that may fit nicely within the Johnson & Johnson business. Chris DelOrefice : Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Operator, last question, please. Operator : Yes. That question will be coming from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. Two unrelated questions that require, I think, quick answers. I'll ask both upfront. First, on the potential knock-on impact of the vaccine, I appreciate the not-for-profit nature of the product. But do you expect to see a halo effect, meaning do you think the vaccine will help pull through or benefit other areas of the portfolio? And then my second question, maybe for Thibaut. At 28%, how much further can consumer margins go? And then any further commentary on the inflationary pressures that you alluded to in the commentary? Thanks. Jennifer Taubert : I'll jump in on the vaccine question first. Really, we're really proud of what we've been able to do in bringing forward a COVID vaccine. And we see this as, really, the start of what will become a vibrant vaccine business for Johnson & Johnson. You were talking about the halo effect or a knock-on effect. We believe the good that we're doing in the world, and that we will continue to be doing on the COVID vaccine, is a great start. And in our pipeline right now, we've got a number of vaccines in development that we hope to have positive results coming from, including an RSV vaccine, an HIV vaccine, one for prevention of sepsis and others that we're looking at. We hope this to be a start of what will become a very vibrant vaccine business for us over time. Thibaut Mongon : Yeah. And to your question on consumer. As I said, we have seen the first half, and we continue to expect into the back half of the year pressure in part of our Portfolio in terms of commodity inflation and distribution costs. We are prepared to absorb those. And in terms of margin improvements, we are committed to continuously improve our margin profile. But as I said, it's going to be a mix of continuing search for efficiencies, but also investment in our business, whether it's brand-building activities or new innovation program. Chris DelOrefice : Great. Thanks, Jayson. Appreciate the question. And thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thank you, Chris. And thank you really, everyone for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter results and updated outlook. We are incredibly proud of the relentless focus each of our JNJ colleagues apply to really meet patient and consumer needs around the globe, resulting in a strong financial performance this quarter across the enterprise while simultaneously investing for a very strong future. I'm very confident in our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing even beyond the mathematical year-on-year comps. And hopefully, that's your takeaway today. Thank you for your time and bye for now. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

This is Sarah Wood, Senior Director, Investor Relations, for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the third quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021. On today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and So, during the Q and A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, and Worldwide Chair, Medical Devices. Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health, and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair Pharmaceuticals.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor. jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statements included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.  In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time. And the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures.  These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary before providing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021 results. The remaining time will be available for your questions.  We anticipate the webcast to last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 13.5% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago.  Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.4%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the side you have in front of you, unless otherwise stated, percentage is quoted, represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  Beginning with consumer health, worldwide consumer health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the consumer health business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove increased sales of Tylenol and Motrin globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for cough, cold, flu, and Digestive Health brand such as IMODIUM.  Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior-year comparisons, specifically prior-year reduction in consumption in China. Our skin health beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of [Indiscernible] in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial moisturizing and body care driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset by external supply constraints and lost sales from the sun aerosol recall.  Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for Listerine in the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior-year COVID-19 related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by strong performance in Asia-Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind Listerine's germ fighting ability. The baby care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia-Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong Aveeno performance, along with category and e-commerce growth in the U.S. Our Women's Health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior-year COVID-19 impacts.  And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable comparisons to prior-year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia-Pacific. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2% with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continue to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. The immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition.  STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7% driven by market growth and share gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly seven points in all sort of colitis in the U.S. TREMFYA was up 63.5% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis. Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, and continued launches globally.  DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter, as an example. ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market leading share position, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts.  In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth. Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The cardiovascular, metabolism, and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures and INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.  Pulmonary hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date total to 766 million. Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit price of $7.50. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales of $6.6 billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%. In the medical devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the quarter with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopedics deemed to be more elective in nature, continuing to lag in terms of recovery.  The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 13.2% driven by market recovery, success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular, and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific. Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally, driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across Endo cutters, biosurgicals, and energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in Endo cutters and energy in the U.S. Building on the MONARCH robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial achievement, now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures. General Surgery grew 8.1% globally.  Wound Closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by procedure recovery, China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion, and continued competitive growth in both traditional and barbed suture markets. The Worldwide Orthopedics franchise declined 0.3% with U.S. declines of 4.5% reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7% globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S., and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S. Results reflect global market recovery dynamics and success of recent product introductions like our cannulated compression headless screws, advanced nailing systems and FIBULINK. Hips grew 2.3% globally, driven by recovery and procedures primarily outside the U.S. and continued leadership in the anterior approach supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as ACTIS femoral stem, PINNACLE dual mobility and VELYS hip navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image guidance capability for VELYS hip navigation, which support surgeons who prefer the posterior approach in addition to the anterior approach.  Needs grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S. Growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Results in the quarter also benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global growth. Lastly, within Orthopedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure volume related to COVID-19.  The Worldwide Vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery, commercial initiatives, and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives, and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL, and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking worth about 10 points. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy.  Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. This $3.4 billion investment was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. In process research and development reflects a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2022 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges. Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D and litigation-related charges. Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur. Along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions driven by one-time current quarter special items. excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5% versus 19% in the same period last year.  I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing For additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year with some changes between our 3 segments.  Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9% driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margin improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and overall expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 24.4% to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 one-time item and increased brand marketing expenses partially offset by COGS improvement. That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflected continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses, and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine.  Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the UK, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. We continue to believe these variables are more short-term in nature and the Medical Devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19.  The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia, and we announced the start of a Phase 3 study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted [Indiscernible] drug designation for nipocalimab in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves, characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes. This represents nipocalimab 's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase 3 trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit.  Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday the FDA 's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend emergency-use authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single-shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19.  We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18th. In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the enhanced shoulder system in the third quarter, a first to market fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations.  We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON Circular powered stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. Let's transition to financials starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with a recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future Talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final equitable resolution of all Talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent.  Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our MONARCH platform for lung bronchoscopy, and are well on our way to expanding MONARCH indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer, and submitting an application to the FDA for MONARCH to be used in the treatment of kidney stones.  Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S. has received several OUS approvals and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems place to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately two years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19 related disruptions, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries.  Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform and will provide updates to the external community as warranted. Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. Moving to our full-year 2021 guidance.  Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13%, or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or 93.1 billion.  As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 where $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. Moving to other items of the P&L, consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.  Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain one time favorable tax positions and settlements both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. Well, not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share.  Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders. We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone everywhere, and I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the increases last three years, and to observe and to learn from him both professionally and personally.  I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees, and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18th Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. I am pleased our Worldwide Chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon, and Jennifer Taubert are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre, from our Investor Relations team, will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : Sure. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, [Operator Instructions]. Please limit your questions to 1 question only. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I guess just first, can you just quantify or elaborate on the impact that the Delta variant head on 3Q results in your guidance. I guess I'm trying to get to was the impact you saw in the third quarter basically in line with what you had contemplated in guidance, or did we have upside elsewhere in the portfolio that offset some of those slowdowns that you mentioned that hit part of the businesses? And then just maybe building on that as we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the portfolio as a whole? I guess I'm trying to get to this base pharma growth sustainable at these levels. And should we think about still Device growth, maybe above historic levels as we get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit? Thanks so much. Joseph Wolk : Yes, Chris. So this is Joe Wolk. Let me answer some of it quantitatively and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what I guess has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in two categories. The vaccine, quite frankly. And as you saw, we did not change the full-year guidance. So that is simply timing.  We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter and we're still very much committed to the 2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. With respect to medical devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year, so that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on medical devices and then to Jennifer to discuss pharmaceuticals. Ashley Mc Evoy : Sure. Thanks, Joe. And thanks for the question, Chris. When I look at quarter three as we share, procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily due to obviously the Delta. So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia-Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre - COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia.  China clearly is setting a new pace for the world. When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth procedures in May. We saw a stabilization in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dip around mid-single digit, and we saw that continue into the early part of September.  We are starting to see, qualitatively, recovery from hospital systems the past four weeks, where we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel. We look at diagnostic procedures and the past four weeks we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro-surges in areas like the Northwest as well as the Midwest. And then, in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease its strict mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures, given the vaccine deployment accelerations, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations, and overall, procedure volumes are gradually improving, like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre -COVID. The UK, where I was just there 2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019, long waiting list, really working to go, make progress on that patient funnel. I'll turn you to Jennifer for any other commentary. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thanks, Ashley. And hi, Chris. So we've got a real positive outlook on the pharmaceutical business, and if you take a look at our third quarter results, we had clear double-digit growth across a number of our key brands, including DARZALEX and ERLEADA in oncology, TREMFYA and STELARA in immunology, and OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI in pulmonary hypertension. Those areas we have seen strong recovery and we believe that the trajectory on those assets is really going to continue, so continued trajectory in '21 and into '22.  The area part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting to see it tick back, is really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, the market where IMBRUVICA is right now for IMBRUVICA, we just achieved double-digit growth ex-U.S. but in the U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's one that, as you take a look and we move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there, but really strong results in 3Q and we anticipate continued strong trajectory through the rest of the year and into '22. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Ashley and Jennifer and Chris, I know you asked about medical devices and pharmaceuticals. But to be complete, Thibaut I know you had great success in the quarter, 6%, almost 9% when you compare to Q3 of 2019, maybe give a little bit of an outlook as to what you're seeing for the balance of the year and into next? Thibaut Mongon : Yes, certainly, Joe. As you just said, consumer segment continues to experience very strong momentum. So we are very pleased with how the portfolio continues to perform around the world. Clearly this quarter, the star is our OTC segment growing double-digit with a continued strong demand for trusted brands in allergenics, but also Digestive Health, continued demand in smoking cessation as well. So across all categories and around the world, continued strong demand for our product. As we get into Q4 and into 2022, we expect our portfolio of brands to continue to be very well positioned in the markets and categories in which we compete. Our brand -- many of our brands iconic, and we would expect continued growth for this brand around the world. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Thibaut. Jen, back to you. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thank you for your question, Chris. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to just circle up on the announcements around the tax litigation and the process that J&J is undergoing. Is there any way -- I know you're not going to talk about -- deeply about the strategy, but just thinking about milestones for this process and any way you can help us understand when this strategy will be fully cleared and in play, and I guess stamp of approval by the bankruptcy courts or how should we thinking about this process through the rest of this year and into 2022? Joseph Wolk : Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the safety based on decades of science that these products are safe. What we've done is acknowledge that there's an established process that allows companies facing abuse of toward systems to resolve claims in an efficient and equitable manner. We initiated this process specifically for our cosmetic talc claims, both for current and future. And while we believe the cases lack merit, and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries, and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us.  We did establish a $2 billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff's attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know that based on prior experience precedent, that claimants are far better off and clarity and resolution is in the best interest of all stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the process, but we're really beholden to how the bankruptcy court decides to proceed and their timeline. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one for Ashley. Just Ashley, it looks like Q3 growth in devices relative to 2019 was about 4%. Could you confirm that? And what are your expectations for Q4 relative to that metric -- relative to Q4, 2019 after adjusting for one less week. I think people are trying to understand if Q4 growth could be better than Q3 on an underlying basis versus 2019. And how are you thinking about the staffing shortages and supply constraints that I think Joe alluded to and inflation. How are you thinking about those factors that people are concerned about in the device industry? Thanks for taking the question. Ashley Mc Evoy : Thanks for the question, Larry. And before I get to quarter 4, let me just give a quick frame for quarter 3 just at a macro level. First is really the market. And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the MedTech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlining foundation of these end-state markets continue to remain attractive really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and quite frankly, the overall state of the technology on the S-curve. Quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest MedTech Company with 11 platforms delivering at least a billion in annual sales, we are very much focused on competitiveness and innovation.  In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology. Biosurgery gaining share and hips seeing the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision. Now seeing several sequential quarters of share gains and even seen stabilization in knees year-to-date. So this is really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. As Joe mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches year-to-date. And this is a significant amount over last year.  So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve 4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019 the full year. And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed to leading in the future of surgery and making our medical innovation smarter, less invasive, and more personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our MONARCH reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich pipeline. VELYS Knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale. And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but sometimes we do experience technical challenges, but we are absolutely committed to resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive differentiated offering as soon as possible. When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite master rolling how to manage patient flows. We are when I talk to hospital systems over the past three weeks and particularly in United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patients sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thanks for your question, Larry. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about some of the management changes that were announced and how we should think about what could change or what could stay the same under a new CEO and CSO. And then, any anticipated changes to business mix between Pharma Med Device and consumer as a result of new leadership? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll try to address that one. What I would say is, first off, I'd probably repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex, as well as Joaquin. Alex clearly on a stellar career, a great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's riding completely off into the sunset. Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful.  That's investing in innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard of healthcare across the globe. The nice thing about the transition is, I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part of Joaquin 's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice Chair over a number of years.  So I would expect as the organization does a very smooth transition. With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HID, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again here at J&J but also on the global stage. I think the -- probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through nine months than what it was last year, and last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invest in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we approach our business. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Louise, thanks for your question. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could focus a little bit on the upcoming BCMA CAR-T launch and just talk a little bit about how you think about your capacity to supply that market and your preparations for that launch. Thanks. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Sure. Hi, it's Jennifer. So we are really looking forward to our upcoming PDUFA date in the 4th quarter for our BCMA CAR-T. This is going to be our first entry into cell therapy, and so the total team from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple of years preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen, and they're really deep and durable responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is going to be a really meaningful and transformational asset for patients.  As we have been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful approach to scaling our global manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who come before us, and that we're really going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and patient treatment or provider treatment center experience as well as we scale up.  So the team has been working very heavily on this and we're gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients hopefully later this year. I also want to call out the very strong partnership that we have with Legend Biotech, where we've been attached at the hip throughout and we're so excited to be working in partnership with them to be bringing that to market. I'm looking forward to a good launch later this year. Ashley Mc Evoy : Thanks, Jennifer. Bob, thanks for your question, Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I had one for Ashley, just on the knee business in the U.S. and one quick follow-up if I could on COVID vaccines. So Ashley, I think one of the things that was mentioned was sort of continued growth and expansion around the knee business, if I'm not mistaken and in ASCs, and obviously the VELY's launch. If you could talk, maybe ASC, I guess, needs or something that we [Indiscernible] regional fluctuation around the U.S. is to uptake some areas stronger than others and love to get your sense of how that's progressing, where it's stronger and why, and how you see that playing out and as I mentioned, one follow-up on vaccines. Ashley Mc Evoy : Thank you for the question, Matt. As Sarah shared in quarter 3, knees grew 2% versus 2020, and a lot of that was due to really two-folds. One is the state of innovation, so the VELYS knee robot is obviously getting some nice traction. As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That coupled with a very proven differentiated ATTUNE knee implant, with a revision offering, as well as the cementless rotating platform have all really helped [Indiscernible] up, I would say, our portfolio in knees.  And then you mentioned the channel and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly enjoined in ASC. And really we started to deploy what we call an advanced case management, which is really how you simplify the pre -op planning in ASC and that new advanced case management service is starting to really take effect. And we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve not just in [Indiscernible], not just in the U.S., but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery. Thank you for the question. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thanks, Ashley. Matt, you want to ask your vaccine follow-up. Matthew Harrison : Just we hadn't touched on it this call, but the sort of pivot to commercial, would love to get your sense of how we should think about timing and the sort of catalysts for that product becoming a commercial product, whether next year or the year after. Ashley Mc Evoy : Yeah. So we're really proud of the role that our vaccine's playing and really helping address the global COVID pandemic throughout the world. And hopefully, you saw last week that the FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended a booster for our COVID vaccine. We are in the process right now of continuing under emergency use authorization to roll-out our vaccine across the globe in both in developed markets, as well as developing markets.  I think as the pandemic, as we continue to work through and fulfill our existing contracts that we have throughout the globe, and as we move into more of a booster market in later '22, potentially into 2023, we'd be looking at moving into a more of a commercial market. I know our R&D team is gearing up and getting ready to file for full approval. I think we want to be moving into a full approval market for that switchover to commercial. Joseph Wolk : Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for raising the point because I do think that underscores in that question just the strength of our core business, right? So vaccines in and of itself this year is not for profit. As Jennifer said, we'll rely on the science and the data to guide us how we proceed commercially. But you should all consider that as upside to our base plan. We're so proud of the results that we've been able to accomplish, the investment in R&D, and just the strength of the portfolio not just this year, but how it really sets up for the balance of this decade, I think is something that people should take away from the call. I always smile a little bit whenever there's vaccine news because it seems to be overly pronounced impact on our stock, good or bad. And it always just makes me chuckle a little bit because of the strength of our business is really in our pharmaceutical medical device and consumer strength these days. Jennifer Mc Intyre : And if I can jump in as well and just put in a commercial for our upcoming pharmaceutical business review. On November 18th, we're really looking forward to having a comprehensive overview of the business, our robust pipeline, our -- featuring our therapeutic area leaders and also really outlining our long-term growth outlook. So we're really excited. I think at that meeting, we're planning for a great day and we'll be highlighting a number not only our key therapeutic areas and delving deep in the pipelines, but also having a chance to feature a number of the key assets that folks, I know, have really, really interest in the learning more about. So everything from [Indiscernible], our BCMA CAR-T to nipocalimab that we got through our MOMENTA acquisition last year, Our new treatment for lung cancer, and what we hope will be expanding into a much broader market, RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. Our Retina portfolio. Also, things like our RSV vaccine, and our TARIS Drug Delivery platform for bladder cancer, and then, I could go on and on. But nonetheless, we're really planning for a very exciting day on November 18th and look forward to having you all join us. Joseph Wolk : That was a 60-second spot, Jennifer. Thibaut is going to tell you about the rates on that one, if you say. Jen. Jennifer Mc Intyre : We're really looking forward to a great day. I couldn't pass on this opportunity to not highlight it. Thanks, Matt, for your question. Rob, last question please. Operator : Your last question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. I just had a quick question, a follow-up to Ashley on the Medical Device business, and I'm just curious, it feels like now there might be a little bit more uncertainty around the pace of recovery. I just want to be sure I'm getting that message correct. And you did mention that you didn't expect the hospital labor shortages to necessarily improve as we go through Q4, so I was just curious about how to reconcile that with the strong recovery. Thanks so much. Ashley Mc Evoy : Thanks for the question, Danielle. I think what we're planning for quarter four is I think we'll still continue to see micro-surges in cases. There will always be little hot spots. Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near-term immediately. I will qualify that so to say that they have been quite frankly masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally, similar to the trends we saw in quarter two where surgical procedures grew low single-digit above 2019 baselines.  As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near-term. But I would just say going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data and the freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by quarter [Indiscernible] performance from 2021 Q4 versus last year. You'll recall we ended around 1.5% Medical Devices did in revenue versus 2019. So we are anticipating a healthier recovery. Joseph Wolk : And Danielle, maybe just to clarify too. It's a recovery no matter what. It's just the intensity of the recovery so I would not expect, based on what we know today, any backward step with respect to Medical Devices performance going forward across the industry. Jennifer Mc Intyre : Thanks, Danielle, for your question and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Our apologies to those we couldn't get to today because of time, but please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Jen. So I hope you take away from the third quarter results, as well as this call, just how broad our financial strength is. Setting us up very well to close out 2021. But more importantly, 2022 and beyond. We certainly do look forward to seeing many of you in New Brunswick on November 18th, where Jennifer McIntyre and a number of the pharmaceutical leaders will be featuring our product portfolio and just how optimistic we are about the future. With that, I'll close the call and wish everyone a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and our financial outlook for 2022. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments and additionally, full year 2021 results for the enterprise. Joe will provide some additional business commentary, insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2022. Joaquin will close the call by sharing his perspective on the healthcare environment and his strategic priorities as the new CEO of Johnson & Johnson. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. Now to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $24.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 11.6% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales growth was 18.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 21.2%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.3% worldwide, 3.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included additional shipping days, which negatively impacted 2021 fourth quarter growth by approximately 400 basis points and full year growth by about 100 basis points. These impacts can be roughly applied across all segments, but were more heavily skewed to the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.77 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.65 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.13, representing increases of 14.4% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.2%. For the full year 2021, consolidated sales were $93.8 billion an increase of 13.6% compared to the full year of 2020. Operationally, full year sales grew 12.2%, with currency having a positive impact of 1.4 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 9.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales growth was 18.2%. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew by 15.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.8% worldwide, 9.5% in the U.S. and 16.6% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2021 were $20.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $7.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.51 a year ago. 2021 adjusted net earnings were $26.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.80, representing increases of 22.2% and 22%, respectively, versus full year 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 20.2%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2021 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and grew 1.8%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and 2.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by the 2020 additional shipping days worth approximately 400 basis points, which can be roughly applied to all franchises as well as industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to raw material availability and labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business worth approximately 360 basis points. Adjusting for these items, solid results were primarily driven by above-market growth in OTC. E-commerce continues to have strong double-digit growth. Finally, when comparing to 2019, Consumer Health grew approximately 4% in the quarter. When adjusting for acquisition and divestitures, sales growth was closer to 5%. Over-the-counter medicines globally grew 15.8% due to increased incidents in U.S. adult and pediatric fever and worldwide category recovery in cough, cold and flu and digestive health. The U.S. also saw share gains primarily in TYLENOL and MOTRIN. Strength was seen across multiple areas in the portfolio, including analgesics, upper respiratory, digestive health, naturals and anti-smoking aids. The Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 7.1%, driven by external supply constraints, primarily in NEUTROGENA and OGX and divestitures worth approximately 230 basis points, primarily due to Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Ci Labo in Asia Pacific. Declines were partially offset by market recovery and e-commerce strength. Oral Care declined globally 6.5% as compared to strong double-digit growth in the prior year, driven by the floss divestiture worth approximately 170 basis points and category declines in EMEA. Declines were partially offset by successful brand building and promotional campaigns in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise declined 0.8% with U.S. declines of 7.5% and growth of 1.3% outside the U.S. Declines were driven by prior year retailer stocking and external supply constraints in the U.S., partially offset by e-commerce growth of AVEENO Baby and Asia Pacific. Wound Care declined 6.4%, primarily due to the divestiture of the professional tape business worth approximately 150 basis points, partially offset by strong performance of Band-Aid brand and adhesive bandages in the U.S. Women's Health grew 1.3%, driven by market recovery in Latin America. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $14.3 billion grew 17.9%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 4.2% and OUS sales increasing by 36.9%. Worldwide sales included a $1.6 billion contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide growth was 18.6%. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver the tenth consecutive full year of worldwide above-market adjusted operational growth. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 7.1% driven by strong performance of TREMFYA and STELARA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. TREMFYA was up 82.8% worldwide, with continued share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased nearly 3 points in both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications. STELARA grew 5.1% worldwide driven by strong share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with increases of roughly 4 points and roughly 6 points, respectively, in the U.S. Current quarter growth was impacted by a negative prior period rebate adjustment and reserve adjustment recorded in Q4 2021 in the U.S. worth approximately 700 basis points on worldwide growth for the quarter versus the prior year. Our Oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 12.3%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 33.4% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 8 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA grew 61.3% worldwide, driven by strong share uptake, increased market penetration in the U.S. and new launches outside of the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintained its market leadership position, however, declined 3.1% worldwide due to competitive pressures from novel oral agents. U.S. decline was partially offset by growth in all regions outside of the U.S. Neuroscience grew 7.1% worldwide driven by the paliperidone long-acting portfolio posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts, strong persistency globally and the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA in the quarter. The cardiovascular, metabolism and other business declined 13.8% worldwide due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our pulmonary hypertension portfolio was roughly flat, driven by COVID-19 market constraints and generic entrants and other pulmonary hypertension, offset by U.S. share uptake in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.9 billion, growing 5.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales grew 5.6% worldwide. The medical devices market continued to be impacted by COVID-19, with the Omicron variant contributing to a softening of recovery trends in medical and surgical procedures, especially late in the quarter. Consistent with prior COVID-19 surges, impacts were more acute in areas deemed to be more deferrable in nature, including spine and knees. Comparing to 2019, Medical Devices grew about 4% on an adjusted operational basis. On a full year basis, Medical Devices growth versus 2019 was just over 4.5%, building on the pre-COVID growth momentum. Interventional Solutions continued to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 15.3% driven by market recovery, successful penetration of new products and commercial execution across both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS. Advanced Surgery grew 7.6% worldwide, driven by market recovery; expansion into Tier 2 and 3 hospitals in China; and performance of newer products such as ENSEAL X1 in Energy, ECHELON+ in endocutters and SURGICEL powder in biosurgery. MONARCH system orders in the fourth quarter marked the highest number of orders in any quarter since launch. And more importantly, as a positive indicator of MONARCH technology adoption and patient treatment regimens, we continue to see strong growth in the number of MONARCH-enabled bronchoscopy procedures with total procedures since launch exceeding 12,000. In fact, 2021 MONARCH procedures more than doubled those performed in the prior year. General Surgery grew 1.7% worldwide, led by wound closure, primarily due to market recovery, coupled with innovation penetration. Inventory dynamics in the prior year negatively impacted wound closure U.S. results by about 350 basis points and positively impacted results outside the U.S. by about 250 basis points. Worldwide orthopedics declined 0.7% versus prior year, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 2.0%, driven by continued market stabilization and the success of recently launched products, partially offset by competitive pressures in China. The positive impact on growth from prior year inventory contractions in China was primarily offset by the additional shipping days in 2020. Worldwide hips grew 2.7%, driven by continued strength from our portfolio, including the ACTIS stem and technologies such as VELYS hip navigation, sustaining our leadership in the anterior approach. Growth in the outpatient surgery channel in the U.S. and market recovery outside the U.S. were additional contributors to growth. Worldwide knees was relatively flat with a decline of 4.2% in the U.S. and growth of 6.5% outside the U.S. The U.S. market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and healthcare resource constraints on procedures. These impacts were partially offset by strong growth in the outpatient channel and positive momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Growth outside the U.S. was driven by market recovery and success of products such as ATTUNE Revision. Lastly, in Orthopedics, worldwide spine declined 9.4%, primarily driven by a deceleration in procedure volumes related to COVID-19 and health system resource constraints. Partially offsetting this decline are the positive impacts from the continued success of new products such as X-Pac, CONDUIT and SYMPHONY and prior year inventory reductions in China contributing approximately 360 basis points to worldwide growth. Worldwide Vision grew 11%. Contact lens and other grew 7.1% worldwide. U.S. growth of 9.4% was driven by successful commercial campaigns and adoption of recently launched ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL for presbyopia. U.S. growth was impacted by inventory fluctuations in both the current and prior year worth about 550 basis points. Growth outside the U.S. of 5.8% was driven by market recovery, coupled with strength of new product launches such as ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical Vision grew 22.1% globally, with both the U.S. and OUS businesses growing double-digits. These positive results were driven by market recovery and share gains from recent differentiated product launches across all Surgical Vision product lines, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy in our ocular lenses used in cataract surgery. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021, I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. As reported earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 reflects a reported increase of 14.5% and an operational increase of 17.2%. Cost of products sold leveraged by 270 basis points, primarily driven by favorable mix within the pharmaceutical business; a reduction in prior year COVID-19 related costs in the Medical Devices business; and favorable mix within the enterprise, with a larger portion of sales from the pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins remained relatively flat, driven by increased brand marketing expense in the Consumer Health business, mostly offset by expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 19% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 by 110 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business and higher investment in the Medical Devices business. The other income and expense line is a net expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $2.4 billion last year. This was driven by lower litigation expenses. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 2.1% compared to a benefit of 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the prior year tax benefit associated with litigation expenses, partially offset by one-time tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.4% versus 11.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2021 10-K for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 24.9% to 25.6%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 recovery. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment : Medical Devices improved by 160 basis points, driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts; Consumer Health margins declined by 460 basis points, primarily driven by increased brand marketing expenses and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. The improvement in Pharmaceutical margins of 110 basis points was primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling, marketing and administration leverage. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. As reported today, our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 reflects a reported increase of 22% and an operational increase of 20.2%. The growth is primarily related to COVID-19 recovery realized predominantly in our Medical Devices business. Lastly, I direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2021 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved by 170 basis points versus 2020. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices improved by 870 basis points to 25.7%, primarily driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 150 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by R&D portfolio progression. Consumer Health margins were flat at 23.8%, driven by increased brand marketing expense and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $2.6 billion or 21% on a full year basis. In the quarter, we received approval by the European Commission for the long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy BYANNLI for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. This approval makes BYANNLI the first twice-yearly treatment for adults living with schizophrenia, providing the longest available dosing interval for an antipsychotic medication to be approved in Europe. Additionally, RYBREVANT received conditional marketing authorization in EMEA. RYBREVANT, a bispecific therapy targeting both EGFR and cMet, is the first treatment approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy. Finally, we submitted a Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of teclistamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and as aligned with our strategy to expand treatment options for multiple myeloma patients. Teclistamab is an investigational off-the-shelf T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3. Consistent with our disciplined approach to portfolio prioritization, we are discontinuing the SELECT Phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of selexipag as an add-on to the standard of care therapy in patients with inoperable CTEPH, as the study did not meet its primary end point. Medical Devices announced a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to further develop a secure and compliant digital ecosystem with a goal of connecting devices across the entire portfolio. This collaboration will help enhance the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to generate insights leading to smarter, less invasive and more personalized solutions across the entire patient care continuum. This concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2021. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jess, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our outlook for 2022. We continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 globally, but it is encouraging to see the resilience of our business, driven by the dedication of countless healthcare professionals and the 136,000 Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Their collective commitment and focus on providing healthcare solutions enabled us to deliver another year of strong financial performance. Our Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth. Medical Devices continued to manage through the ongoing impact of COVID-19 to experience a partial recovery, and Consumer Health grew competitively while navigating industry-wide supply constraints. All of this culminated in Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% for the year, while also investing in our business for the future. We are well positioned as we head into 2022. Before we recap our year-end cash position and guidance for 2022, I'd like to touch on the announcement we made in the fourth quarter regarding our intent to separate our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading companies. As independent companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company will each be better positioned to exercise more focused strategic and capital decisions. We intend for each company to possess compelling financial profiles that reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, enabling each company to be in a position to enhance the strong results that you've come to expect. As far as where we stand in the process, we have established a very strong, largely separate team focused on advancing the separation. And the financial and operational work streams are well underway. As conveyed in November, the Board of Directors' intent is for the planned separation to occur through the capital markets, and there are multiple capital market separation pathways being considered. Depending on the pathway, there are different SEC requirements that must be adhered to. In order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways, we cannot, at this time, disclose specific Consumer Health financial information not previously disclosed or that which is associated with the separation. As such, you can expect that Consumer Health as well as the rest of our business will be reported as it has been reported previously for the entirety of 2022. We can, however, provide a high-level time line for some nonfinancial items, which may be of interest. In the first half of 2022, we anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with our previous communications we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment, working within the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Let's now discuss our 2021 year-end cash position and future capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of nearly $20 billion. At the end of 2021, we had approximately $32 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt for a net debt position of $2 billion. We are pleased that 2021 was another record year in terms of R&D investment at $14.7 billion, a 21% increase over our previous all-time high recorded in 2020. We recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost 5 years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R&D. This includes building upon the 59 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. It also includes, as Joaquin has mentioned in recent forums, utilizing our cash to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps and play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. We will assess opportunities of all sizes. However, our preferred option is tuck-in deals, which typically offer greater value creation. It is also important to note that should we find the right opportunities, the Consumer Health separation work stream will not prevent us from forging ahead. And finally, with respect to capital allocation, modest share repurchases may be evaluated as part of our capital deployment actions. Let me provide a few comments regarding our guidance for full year 2022, which encompasses expectations for our 3 business segments. In our Pharmaceuticals business, we will continue to drive innovation and market-leading sales growth with continued expansion of existing brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and the recently launched RYBREVANT for lung cancer. We are particularly excited about the anticipated FDA approval for [CARVIC-T], our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We believe this medicine is best-in-class, showing unprecedented results in clinical trials. In our Medical Devices business, we expect COVID-19 and hospital staffing to continue to be a dynamic variable, likely more impactful in the first half of 2022 as we cycle through Omicron. Our 2022 guidance assumes continued medical devices market recovery, but it also assumes, as you have heard us say previously, enhanced competitiveness. Almost all of our priority platforms are holding or gaining share based on third quarter 2021 year-to-date information, illustrating the positive business momentum versus 2019 when only about 50% of our platforms were holding or gaining share. This improved market performance enables us to maximize the value of recently launched products. In Consumer Health, we are confident that our well-balanced portfolio positions us well. Consistent with current global macroeconomic trends, we are experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures, including higher input costs across our business and more significantly with respect to Consumer Health. These external challenges include availability and cost of certain commodities, labor and transportation. Similar to competitors, we are instituting price increases across our Consumer Health portfolio in 2022, enabling us to remain competitive as we continue to deliver the products that consumers love and trust. So with that backdrop, let's get into the details for the full year 2022 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. Starting with sales, we expect operational sales growth for the full year 2022 between 7.0% and 8.5%. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures to be negligible, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting the same range as adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% or $100.3 billion to $101.8 billion. Our 2022 sales guidance includes approximately $3 billion from our COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of this volume is outside of the U.S. for low and middle-income countries corresponding to previously signed advanced purchase agreements. As you know, we do not predict currency movement. But for context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.14, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 5.5% and 7.0% or 6.2% at the midpoint compared to 2021, representing a range of $98.9 billion to $100.4 billion for 2022. As done in the past, I will provide a few qualitative comments related to quarterly phasing. Starting with Consumer Health, the supply constraints that were mentioned as part of Jess' commentary for the quarter will continue into 2022. We estimate that the majority of that impact will be experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in the first quarter and primarily in Skin Health, Beauty. We, therefore, expect second half performance to outperform the first half. In Medical Devices, we expect some COVID-19 headwinds and hospital staffing shortages to continue into 2022, but anticipate market recovery as global health systems treat new patients and work through procedure backlogs. Given this, we expect market recovery to improve as the year progresses and greater contribution from the new products launched in 2021 for an overall better second half. Finally, in Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate our market-leading performance will be fairly stable throughout the year, with perhaps some modest adjustments for timing of events associated with alliance revenue or tenders. We are monitoring report surface by large insurers that recent office visits are slightly down in both primary care and specialists. I'll continue to go through the items on our P&L, starting with operating margin. We expect 2022 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and write-offs. We expect this to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2022, consistent with 2021 levels.  Finally, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $0 million and $100 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2022 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current assumptions for geographic mix and certain international tax legislation changes for research and development expenses in 2022. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.2% to 10.2% or 9.2% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.40 to $10.60 or $10.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 7.1% versus the prior year. We expect the company's COVID-19 vaccine to contribute approximately an incremental $0.20 to earnings per share in 2022. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'm now thrilled to welcome Joaquin Duato to his first earnings call as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin, as a colleague who has worked alongside you for the past several years, it's clear that healthcare and providing good health for everyone, everywhere is not just your business, but a passion. I am excited to welcome you in your new capacity and look forward to continuing to partner with you, the Executive Committee and our colleagues across the globe in our mission to change the trajectory of health for humanity.  Over to you, Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you all for my first earnings announcement as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. We appreciate everyone tuning in today, and thank you for your interest in our company. Despite continued and evolving impact from COVID-19 globally, Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong year of sales and earnings growth. Full year Johnson & Johnson adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% reflects the tenth consecutive year of adjusted operational above-market growth from Pharmaceuticals, the ongoing positive growth momentum from Medical Devices and continued competitive growth in Consumer Health. These strong results contribute to my confidence in our ability to achieve 2022 operational sales and earnings per share growth in the high single digits, with EPS growth that is higher than sales despite macroeconomic factors such as inflation. This, coupled with our differentiated portfolio of pipeline innovation, further strengthens my confidence in our long-term growth potential. In recent months, I have been busy meeting and listening to our customers, partners and members of the Johnson & Johnson family around the world. As part of these conversations, I have thought about the underlying constant of our business, the secret ingredient to our success. It is our people, their dedication and their eagerness to ask the toughest questions and seek the boldest and bravest answers. I'm deeply optimistic about our future, and I feel energized about the potential for our business. In the last 2 years, COVID-19 has changed global perceptions and attitudes towards healthcare. It has shown us that there is significant opportunity for change and improvement in order to better serve patients, customers and communities around the world. The global response to the pandemic has also created a renewed sense of optimism about the power of science. Around the world, people are focused on personal and societal health in new and urgent ways. And importantly, people are demanding that companies deliver on their promises and act with purpose. Johnson & Johnson will continue to answer that call. We strongly believe the future ahead of us looks brighter and healthier for every patient and consumer. We are determined to achieve this future, grounded by the same mission and credo that always guided us. In 2022, we will run our business as we always have, with these segments, maximizing opportunities for each individually. And I would like to share a bit about our near-term priorities as we focus on successfully creating a new independent Consumer Health company as well as continuing to build on our individual global leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices while enhancing synergies, which uniquely position us to accelerate growth and bring differentiated therapies that span both segments. At the end of last year, I laid out my top 3 priorities for a new era for Johnson & Johnson, and those priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are equally important for our success and include driving Medical Devices to become a best-in-class performer. We continue to focus on improved execution as evidenced by market share momentum as well as our improved cadence of innovation and organic and inorganic expansion into higher growth markets and market segments. We have 11 platforms in Medical Devices, which are over $1 billion. And as we have shared previously, we are gaining or holding share in almost all of this. This includes building upon our global market-leading positions in areas like electrophysiology, biosurgery and contact lenses and gaining market share in areas where we have been more challenged like Surgical Vision. The team has also launched over 20 new products during 2021, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in orthopedics and 2 new intraocular lenses in Surgical Vision. Next, delivering on our Pharmaceutical business commitments and long-term growth goals. We are continuing to build upon our promising pharmaceutical pipeline, which we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth rates and are focused on our previously announced long-term goal of growing to a $60 billion segment by 2025. We are continuing to maximize the value of our existing medicines with 13 marketed medicines across 6 therapeutic areas, each to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2025. We expect to file 36 significant line expansions for these 13 products through 2025. Here, it is important to note that these expansions are largely derisked because the products are in the market today, so there is good insight into their overall profiles. In addition, we expect 14 novel therapy filings through 2025, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in revenue and 5 of this with the ability to exceed $5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the potential patent expiries as we have done in the past and continue to grow at above market rates. And finally, ensuring the successful creation of the new Consumer Health company.  In the coming year, we will take the steps necessary to be in a position to separate our Consumer Health business from our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device businesses during 2023. This will advance more targeted business strategies, accelerate growth and deliver improved outcomes for both patients and consumers, which ultimately will deliver greater value to shareholders. Our Consumer Health business is competitive in terms of growth and over the past few years has made significant progress improving the margin profile. And as we advance towards a successful new stand-alone Consumer Health company, we will continue to drive this business with the same focus we always have. Our best-in-class team is delivering science-backed innovation across OTC, Skin Health and our Specialty business with a focus on digital, consumer-centric solutions and seamless end-to-end customer experience. As Joe noted, we continue to believe that a fit-for-purpose corporate structure and a dedicated capital allocation strategy will provide the Consumer Health business with the agility and flexibility to continue to grow its iconic portfolio of brands and innovate new products in the fast-paced consumer market. And we expect this new and independent company, with nearly $15 billion in 2021 sales, will continue to be a global leader in the consumer health industry. And the new Johnson & Johnson at nearly $80 billion in sales in 2021 will continue to be the largest, most diversified healthcare company in the world and will retain the benefits of scale. We'll enhance our ability to be more focused with our operations, making the new Johnson & Johnson poised to bring integrated and comprehensive care to patients through the use of new technology and innovative science. As we continue to focus on our 3 sectors today, we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Our strong financial position, along with the clear priorities we have for our business, position us well to deliver near-term financial expectations and invest for the long-term value creation. We'll have the flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and maintain our track record of growing our dividend while aspiring to be bolder with strategic value-creating acquisitions that will enhance the new Johnson & Johnson in higher growth markets. At this critical time for healthcare and our global society, we understand the significant role we play, and we accept the responsibility and challenges of the future. I hope you will all join us as we step forward into this new era. Thank you. And with that, let me turn it back to Jess to open the Q&A. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Jan. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So I wanted to ask you about M&A. Do you think certain M&A targets look more interesting to you given the significant pullback in biotech valuations? Or do you still think some of these good assets are overvalued? And do you think companies and boards of mid-cap biotechs have capitulated to valuation resets? Or will that take more time? Joaquin Duato : Thank you. Thank you for the question. As we commented, our strong financial performance in 2021 is enveloped in a very strong financial profile, giving us the latitude to manage both for the long-term while meeting the short-term expectations of the financial community. As Joe commented, too, we are about to turn from a net debt to a net cash position for the first time in over 4 years. So we'll have to -- we'll have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend, be bolder in strategic acquisitions and enhance the new J&J position in higher growth markets. And if warranted, we also would consider share repurchase programs. I believe that these priorities position us well for the future. And I think it's important to consider that when we get into 2022, we'll continue to manage the business strategically, one. The separation and the creation of the new consumer company, it's not going to slow us down of any priorities. So we continue to think about how we are going to opportunistically deploy cash for both organic and inorganic initiatives. And in other words, I wanted to make clear that if the right opportunities are there, in medtech and pharmaceuticals, the work stream of the separation won't held us back from forging ahead. When it comes to Pharmaceuticals, as you mentioned, we presented our outlook for the business in our November R&D review. And we explained to you that we were anticipating -- we are anticipating above-market growth rates reaching $60 billion by 2025, growing every single year there. So when we think about those results, it's important to remember that we do not factor there any future acquisitions or collaborations and that we are confident to reach those goals without inorganic activity. That said, one of the pillars of our success has been our agnostic view related to innovation and our desire to lean in for the new Johnson & Johnson for opportunities to build our current portfolio and our current portfolio, both in pharma and medtech remains there, and we need to look for that to enhance our growth profile. In fact, over the past 5 years, our investments in organic R&D and externally sourced innovation have been about equal. We continue to look to opportunities to be able to enhance our pharmaceutical portfolio. And we have been very proficient in identifying opportunities that have a high probability of success very early on as we have done, for example, with Legend. And also, we have been good looking at the post proof-of-concept opportunities like we did with Momenta. In the future, we'll continue to look for all types of opportunities early on post proof-of-concept. And we also will look at other opportunities of large size that we'll have to fulfill higher from a financial perspective, given the higher operational complications that these opportunities may take. But yes, we are constantly looking at M&A as a key source of growth for our business. Our position in cash today makes us been more aggressive in that area, and we'll continue with our focus on taking acquisitions, but not excluding, if the situation is granted, to look at medium-sized also opportunities. Joseph Wolk : Yes, Louis, thanks for the question. This is Joe. I would just say, maybe to further elaborate on Joaquin's points, With respect to your question on valuations, it's really hard to say whether there's been a capitulation or a recognition that values have come down. I think we probably need to see a little bit longer period of that. I don't think things are out there necessarily on sale. But I will say that it really just takes 2 parties to agree on a valuation that makes sense. And a lot of times, the valuation is driven by the capabilities, the skills, the scientific expertise that we have that maybe that potential partner or acquired asset does not have at that time. So that's the kind of the way we look at it. Again, I don't think there's a capitulation, but we are seeking to use some of the cash on the balance sheet in a very disciplined, responsible way, that compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf where we can create great value. Jessica Moore : Next question, Rob? Operator : Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Joe or Joaquin, can you help us think about device growth in Q1? How has January '22 trended relative to January 2021? And how are you thinking about medtech market growth in 2022? Previously, I think you expected about 4% to 5% growth. Is that still the case with Omicron and J&J's growth relative to that? How are you thinking about that? Joseph Wolk : Yes, Larry, thanks for the question and your interest. I would say it's somewhat a tale of 2 cities. If you look at surgical procedure volume in the fourth quarter, it eroded over the months of October, November, December. I would say it was roughly flat in the early part of the quarter relative to 2019, which we think is a more appropriate comparison, to down about 5%. The most pronounced area was clearly Orthopedics, which is the most elective segment of our portfolio. However, there's probably some reason for optimism if you look at diagnostic volumes in the fourth quarter. So that average roughly, let's call it 7%. It was a little bit stronger in October than it was in December, but still very positive relative to levels that were experienced in 2019. So we think there is a backlog that is potentially building of diagnosed cases that have yet to be scheduled. That being said, as you've heard from a number of outlets at this point, it really is about the hospital staffing and being able to accommodate surgeries from that perspective. We are seeing reduced cases with respect to Omicron, and we think that will play favorably. The first couple of weeks in January and probably limiting this to a week, maybe 2, saw a little bit of a bleed over from what we experienced in December around surgical procedures. But I do think that's going to improve with each passing month and with each passing quarter as the year goes on. And then as you heard from Joaquin as well as Jess, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on a much more stable market, given our improved competitiveness from where we were just a few years ago, in addition to the enhanced pipeline. Last year, we introduced over 20 products, same expectation for this year as well. So once the market gets to be a little bit more stable, hopefully no more future variants, and hospital administrators who have done a great job through the pandemic continue to modify their plans to ensure appropriate staffing, we think we will be in a very good position to not only approach market growth, but hopefully exceed it. Joaquin Duato : Yes, I would continue building up on Joe's comment that as the Omicron surge resolves, we anticipate that the markets will continue to improve as the year progresses. It is very difficult to predict when Omicron is going to peak, but we are beginning already to see cases decreasing in areas where the surge began like, for example, in the UK, and some regions in the U.S. already nearing peaks. So while COVID-19 may temporarily delay necessary medical and surgical interventions, the vast majority of these procedures cannot be ignored completely. And at the same time, hospitals, as Joe was referring, are getting better dealing with these situations. So while the path is not going to be linear, we expect an improvement as the year starts to go on and the fundamentals of the medtech market remain intact with disease prevalence and the need for surgery and change. So we believe we are optimistic of the value of the market in the long term, and we are optimistic about our medtech business and its ongoing recovery and improvement in the overall competitive position. So when we are facing 2022 on the medtech side, both from a market perspective and also from a Johnson & Johnson perspective, we look at it optimistically. And we think that the situation will clearly improve as Omicron surge resolves and the year progresses. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Larry. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Joaquin, some of your recent public commentary implies -- or not implies, but you relayed that you'll have a focus on Medical Device unit success. I wondered if you could just kind of bracket, yes, I guess, your goals? Is it could sustain mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trajectory for the unit or potentially accelerate towards 6 or even north of 6? And what would you consider success as we look out on a multiyear horizon? And then just in terms of your priorities for investment or your team along with Ashley's for the Medical Device unit, are you going to prioritize investments in areas where there's a higher weighted average market growth rate? Or would you be balanced in thinking about a unit like spine? That's been an anchor unit. I mean, would you -- are you going to balance your investments both internally and externally to a lower performer and the competitiveness despite kind of a low single-digit market growth rate? Or will the focus be on adding assets and investing in businesses that have that higher growth rate? Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Joe. So overall, as I have commented in our Pharmaceutical Analyst Day and also in the different conferences that I have participated, medtech, it's going to be a key priority for me in my tenure. I see medtech and pharmaceuticals being the core of the new Johnson & Johnson that, as Joe commented, will remain the largest and more diversified healthcare company. So clearly, medtech, it's going to be a key area of focus for us in every aspect. When it comes to medtech and its market performance, I have to highlight that we have seen a very clear ongoing recovery in our medtech performance. We went from 1.5% growth in 2017 to nearly 4% in 2019, and we are ending the year at 4.6%. And when you adjust for the 53rd week, we are in about 5%. So we are clearly improving our performance in the medtech space, driven by some market segments which are really delivering in a very strong way. For example, in interventional, our growth ending the year was 15.3%. Our ambition, our growth in the year was 11%. So we have clearly outstanding performance there. And in most of the platforms that we participate, we are gaining share or maintaining share, improving our position. It's difficult for me to bracket exactly what the growth is going to be and when it's going to happen. But our goal clearly is to make our medtech sector a best-in-class performer. So that's going to be a defining element of my tenure, and we are going to be working towards that. We are going to be improving our commercial execution as we are doing today. We'll continue to invest in our organic pipeline that is delivering. We have had the highest level of innovation in our medtech business in 2021 ever, and our pipeline today has the highest value as measured by net present value that we have ever had. And also, we recognize that we need to do and we need to continue to be active in external innovation in order to be able to participate in markets where growth is occurring that we are not participating today or to build upon adjacencies our existing businesses that are going to further our growth. So as in any business, when it comes to their business allocation, we'll continue to drive our winners, and we'll try to efficiently manage the areas in which we are more challenged. And we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that will complement our portfolio and will enable us to enter into higher growth markets. Overall, our past acquisitions suggest that we have been good in managing smaller deals and tacking deals, and that is our base case. But at the same time, we don't have an artificial ceiling in our deal size. We are always looking for any opportunity that exist in the marketplace. But as I said before, when I was commenting about pharmaceuticals, we do know that larger deals are much harder to make work, both financially and operationally, and they will always have a higher bar. So very important for us and for the new Johnson & Johnson, the focus in our medtech business and how much we are going to prioritize this area of our business. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just 2 quick ones here. First, on operating margin leverage, you're talking about 50 basis points in '22. But as I think about longer term, I think about J&J, they got a broad pipeline of assets to invest in. Can we think about the company continuing to leverage its P&L over the next few years, I guess, particularly as you head into the STELARA LOE? Or should we think about a window of time longer term where some of the top line growth is maybe reinvested back in the business and margin expansion kind of is a bit more muted for a few years? And then, Joaquin, just following up on the M&A and Medical Devices. I just want to make sure I'm clear. As we think about business development and the role it's going to play within that division, should we be thinking about something very different than in the past? Or is it more about a tweak in the approach and the strategy from what you've been seeing recently? So is this a lot more deals, if they're smaller or something bigger? Or again, is it just kind of accelerating maybe a bit from what you've been doing in the last few years? Joseph Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to operating margins, I think the 50 basis points is probably something that is reasonable to expect this year given some of the inflationary pressures that we've outlined, likely to be experienced in the first half of this year. That being said, given the size of our company, we do think we can always improve kind of the infrastructure, our operating model to find some leverage in the P&L. I won't commit to any -- to say it's each and every year. I think that's going to be very much dependent upon the opportunities that are presented to us in any given year. And if we've got an opportunity to invest disproportionately in R&D, on a particular asset, we will do that, and we just have to size up that opportunity. But I do think as a general rule, given the size of our company, that we should find some opportunity to operate where we can leverage. I would like to see us as we separate the company, maybe be relabeled as more of a growth company. And therefore, we may reposition that, taking that top line growth and putting that back into the business. But as you can see, even in recent years, we've had, I would say, significant operating margin improvement, but we have not starved investment. R&D was up over last year's record-setting year by $2.6 billion or 20%, as Jess mentioned. So we feel that we're finding that right balance, and we'll continue to do so moving forward. Joaquin Duato : And when it comes to your question, Chris, about M&A in the medtech business. Our aspiration in medtech is to be the first or the second in the markets that we participate. And if we are in markets that -- if we are not in markets that are growing, also have a path to get there, right? Recently, we have divested some of the businesses like diagnostics, pain, diabetes, where we came to the conclusion that it was difficult to get into this #1, #2 position, and that was better to sell that business in order to create value. So given the recent investment activity, what I want to emphasize and I have alluded at the outset is that my priority now is to be more on the acquisitive side and to be more aggressive on the acquisition side, identifying products that complement our portfolio but play in higher growth markets or market segments that we are today. So that's the change in outlook that you are noticing. Joseph Wolk : And Chris, my job will be to keep him disciplined, right? But he's going to conduct that anyway. Jessica Moore : Wonderful. Thank you, Chris. Next question, Rob? Operator : Next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : There are a lot of factors that go into -- I'm thinking about 2022. Obviously, COVID, staffing shortages, foreign exchange, freight, inflation and in certain areas, external supply. When you put together your guidance, how did you weight all these? And is there a lower-end, higher-end range? How do we think about all of these different factors as we think about the start of the year? Joseph Wolk : It's a great question, Joanne, and thank you for it. It's -- and it certainly has been a moving target as we had certain thoughts as '22 would shape up in the beginning of December to where we are actually ending up today. We've tried to address all the risks that are appropriate based on the information that we have as of January 26. And so we've taken into account, I think, a favorable outlook and an improving trend in Medical Devices, but also the fact that it's going to be a slower start to the year for some of the factors that we mentioned. The same type of position was taken with consumer and some of the supply constraints from some of our suppliers. So I think it's the right balance for where we stand today. We know from the last 2 years that things will likely change, and we'll adjust accordingly. In Pharmaceuticals, there's really not much of a change there. We expect that to be pretty stable. We enjoyed our 10th consecutive year of above-market growth, and we're planning for an 11th year in 2022. We did take note of some of the larger insurers who commented last week during their earnings calls about reduced office visits. So we'll continue to monitor that. But given the portfolio in Pharmaceuticals and various severe diseases that we address with our products, we don't see much change there. Joaquin Duato : I would add to that, that just we take into consideration some of the headwinds related to pandemic and also macroeconomic headwinds like inflation, and that's something that we take into consideration when we build our guidance. At the same time, we remain very optimistic in multiple fronts. We remain optimistic on the fact that -- as I commented before, when I was talking about medtech, the strong underlying demand for healthcare is there. And there's still lots to do in multiple diseases in order to address suffering and death there. So there's a strong underlying demand for medical care. And at the same time, both in medtech and in biopharmaceuticals, you see significant opportunity for science progress in terms of new treatment modalities that will give us the opportunity to enrich our pipeline and get to more patients. So we are optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of the new Johnson & Johnson. If you combine that with our scale and diversification, that gives us more confidence on being able to provide a consistent, solid volume-based revenue growth in 2022 as we have described and at the same time, being able to have EPS growth which exceeds our revenue growth. All that is underpinned by a strong investment in R&D. It's important to underline what Joe commented before, we had a record year of investment in R&D in 2021 with close to 21% increase. This is not going to be every year like that, but we are really betting on the future and on the underlying fundamentals when we are thinking about 2022 and beyond. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joanne. Rob, next question, please. Operator : Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : So I have one follow-up on just the topic you were touching on, Joaquin, around R&D investment, and then I\u2019ve a follow-up for Joe, if I could, on inflationary pressure. So you mentioned a couple of times the investments in R&D and in particular, in med devices. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about which one of your -- ones of your programs you're sort of seeing the most investment? And then also in particular, either through R&D investment or M&A, how you see sort of digital playing a role in your sort of organic and strategic investments this year? And the follow-up for Joe is just on inflation. It's a topic that I think everyone is struggling with how to understand the ways that this is impacting margins and businesses. Joe, you mentioned a couple of things about the way that you're offsetting some of these pressures in consumer, perhaps labor and supply costs. I was wondering if you could maybe just touch on the different ways it's affecting your different businesses and how you're managing through that? I appreciate that. Joseph Wolk : Yes. So Matt, let me start with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and how we're offsetting those. So in consumer, there's, I would say, select products within the portfolio, think Skin Health and Beauty, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, where lubricants and things of that nature are in shorter supply. There are some, I'd say, probably increased labor costs with respect to third-party manufacturers, and we're obviously seeing heightened transportation costs. We are like the competitors in the consumer space, offsetting some of those costs with select price increases in our portfolio, where we can still provide those trusted brands and products to people without really impacting the elasticity or the demand of those products overall. We think we can strike that right balance as others have. In Medical Devices, I would say it's around the labor input costs and some of the staffing related to COVID-19, I would say, in the sense of overstaffing to some degree, but those are costs that are clearly managed. They're much like Pharmaceuticals are not prices that we can increase. And then, in fact, the stellar performance that you saw in pharmaceuticals was the sixth consecutive year where we actually had negative price. So the growth that you see is more than 100% of volume due to the innovation and the ability to address unmet medical needs. And then with Medical Devices, most of those specifically in the U.S. are contractual by nature. So there's limited opportunity there as well. So where we can, specifically in consumer, we're looking to pass some of those cost increases on. In other spots, we continue to have supply chain initiatives, manufacturing initiatives that have been in place really for a number of years as part of our overall cost management program. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. So going into medtech, R&D and medtech innovation, let me start by the fact that during 2021, we launched over 20 significant products across each segment of the Medical Device business. Some examples of that, for example, in electrophysiology, we had a limited launch of our QDOT MICRO in Europe. QDOT is a first-in-kind smart micro catheter, which is designed to deliver about 2x to 3x the amount of energy; and at the same time, reduce the total patient exposure and provided exposure to fluoro and reduced total procedure time. And that's helping us in driving our position in electrophysiology. In Orthopedics, we continue our enhancements in orthopedic knees, both with the differentiated next-generation VELYS Robotic-Assisted system. And at the same time, we had the introduction in December of the ATTUNE Cementless fixed bearing base. So these introductions are making us more competitive in the knee space, in the knee arena. In advanced surgery, we have some augmentations to energy to our energy portfolio with our ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer. And in Vision, we introduced our ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL contact lenses; and in Surgical Vision, our intraocular lenses, TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. So great innovation, which is driving our better performance in market performance. When it comes to our pipeline, there are a number of exciting things coming up, for example, our next-generation diagnostic catheter in electrophysiology and also a potential solution in pulsed field ablation. So all these areas make us believe that we're going to remain extremely competitive in electrophysiology. We continue to prioritize the expansion of our VELYS digital surgery potentially into the hip space and also foot and ankle solutions in orthopedics. And specifically, to your question on digital surgery, that's a very important area for us. We have a bold ambition there, and we are already making progress. The first launch was our MONARCH robotic system. Our MONARCH robotic system, it's enabling in the luminal bronchoscopies. And we have already launched it in the U.S., and it's progressing really well. And we are also studying our MONARCH robotic system to deliver energy and also a payload of pharmaceuticals for being able to do local treatment of early lung cancer lesions. At the same time, we have also submitted a 510(k) expansion of MONARCH for a potential treatment in kidney stones that will give us an expanded market in this area. I commented on our successful launch of our robotic system with VELYS, and we recognize that we will have to continue to be committed to develop in Ottava and entering into the general surgery market with a highly competitive offering, and we are working through that as soon as possible, and we will provide updates as we progress. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Matt. Rob, next question? Operator : The next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks so much for taking the question. And Joaquin, welcome to your new position. Good to hear you on the call. Just a question on M&A. I mean that seems to be a hot topic, seems to be a more aggressive stance there. And specifically, in Medical Devices, just thinking about the commentary around preference and tuck-ins. But you have some larger players with a broader presence in areas where you guys actually have pretty significant gap. And these players do have the 1 or 2 position in most of these markets, albeit it's a mix of some higher growth versus some lower growth markets, but certainly gives you the scale that seems like is the direction that the market might be moving in. Just curious if you can comment on sort of how you're balancing the approach to building out further a competitive Medical Device portfolio versus sort of getting it with scale or doing a bunch of tuck-ins that ultimately get you there maybe 5, 10 years down the line? Just wanted to see if you guys could comment on how you're thinking about that. Joaquin Duato : As I have commented in the past occasion, Danielle, our preference is clearly both in medtech and in pharma to look for earlier-stage deals or smaller tuck-in deals in which we can deploy our own capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization in order to create value. And that's where we have been successful, and we are always trying to look for opportunities in that context in market segments that are going to enable us to enter into higher growth areas or to complement through adjacencies our existing portfolio. So that is the way we have been creating value in a very significant way, both in pharma and in medtech. While our past history always suggest smaller deals, as I said before, we don't have an artificial ceiling as far as far as deal size. It has to be something that has to be workable financially and in terms of value creating for shareholders. And typically larger deals are harder to make work both financial and operationally. So that's where we make it more of an emphasis in areas where we have a higher chance of creating value. We are open to midsized and larger deals, and we have demonstrated that we have done that in the past like we did, for example, with Actelion, but we tend to prefer this small new molecule, new device that we can, as I said before, apply a lot of our scientific technology, regulatory expertise and ultimately create this $1 billion platforms that we have, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals. So that's our preference. That's our strategy, but we always remain open to investigate any opportunity or possibility that may be out there. It just has a higher bar from a financial and operational perspective. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Danielle. We have time for one last question. Rob, last question please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. And Joaquin, welcome. A question on STELARA. The loss of exclusivity obviously coming up in September of 2023. Can you update us on your thinking about what the erosion curve could look like? I think that there's some underpinnings in terms of different indications that have been growing. A major competitor with a similarly year, a major blockbuster product in the I&I category has that. And they said that they could update the thinking perhaps towards midyear. Is there a similar update that you might be able to provide? How can we learn more about what the STELARA biosimilar erosion could look like? Joaquin Duato : Chris, and let me take this opportunity also to express how optimistic we are about the future of Pharmaceuticals, and we express in our Pharmaceutical R&D Day that we are very confident of being able to continue to deliver above market growth through the STELARA patent expiration in the U.S. And we are also very confident on the strength that we are showing also in immunology, for example, with TREMFYA, growing 88% and really exceeding expectations. So we are very confident on the potential of TREMFYA, which has exceeded already $2 billion in sales and has gained share both in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So very, very positive about the future of our Pharmaceutical portfolio and also about the strength of STELARA in the immunology market. Regarding the erosion of STELARA, we are going to provide you updates as time goes by. We'll see how things play out with the competitor that it's going to go patent. We'll also learn from our experience with REMICADE, which will be a very good proxy for us and have no doubt, as we approach 2023, we'll be able to provide you a more accurate guidance of what we expect. We -- as I said, we remain optimistic that we'll be able to deliver growth during the STELARA patent expiration every single year. Thank you, Chris. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, everyone, and thank you for your comments and questions today in this my first call as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Every day, as I get into this job, I am reminded of the importance of our mission to continue to work in changing the trajectory of health for humanity. And it's a purpose that energizes everyone at Johnson & Johnson, the 140,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson. We are proud of our performance in 2021 and believe we are extremely well positioned for 2022. We look forward to keep you informed throughout the year. And until then, please be well. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Joe Wolk : Good morning. This is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our company's first quarter 2022 financial results and full year 2022 outlook. While many things have changed in the world since our last call, much has stayed the same for Johnson & Johnson. We continue to deliver reliable growth and generate meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to invest and advance our pipeline, increase our dividend for the 60th consecutive year and continued to make a positive impact across the landscape of health care. It is, however, important to take a few moments to recognize the current events that are impacting the world we're living in. Today, while we're all still managing through the global pandemic, as evidenced by the current surge of cases in China, we also acknowledge the increasing hardship brought on by the war in Ukraine. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and their families. Guided by our credo and grounded in our purpose, our hearts are with all those affected by these crises and hope for a rapid resolution to both. Now, I'd like to turn the program over to Jessica Moore, Vice President, Investor Relations, to take you through our Q1 results. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joe. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medtech; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter. First, we are now providing select earlier phase clinical trial information on our pharmaceutical pipeline to streamline your data collection efforts from clinicaltrials.gov. Second, rather than sharing detailed business performance commentary on each part of the business, I will summarize the significant business drivers, leaving more time for Q&A. You can find additional detailed segment commentary in our earnings presentation. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points. In the US, sales increased 2.7%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 7.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 12.6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.9% worldwide, 2.8% in the US and 12.9% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2021 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning in 2022, certain over-the-counter products previously reported under the Pharmaceutical segment have been reclassed to Consumer Health. These products represent roughly $100 million of sales per quarter. Please refer to the supplemental sales schedules for prior year restatements. Also, as stated in our 2021 10-K, effective January, our Medical Devices segment is now referred to as MedTech. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% with a decline of 3.4% in the US and growth of 4.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 1.6%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the US. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased TYLENOL, MOTRIN and upper respiratory product sales. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the US and 16.7% outside of the US. Base Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial execution, enabling us to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including six assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Base business growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and our paliperidone long-acting portfolio. Growth was partially offset by LOE pressures from both REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with decrease in IMBRUVICA and XARELTO sales. DARZALEX continues to drive very strong operational growth with sales increases of 40.3%, driven by subcutaneous formulation penetration and meaningful share gains across all lines of therapy and in all regions. IMBRUVICA sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in US. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the US despite ongoing competitive pressures. XARELTO sales declined 13.8% in the US, driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7 billion increased 8.5%, with growth of 5.6% in the US and growth of 11.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.6%. We see strong performance in Q1 driven by market recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share across most of the 11 priority platforms. We continue to monitor potential impacts on elective procedures driven by COVID-19 resurgences across various markets. Before highlighting the financial performance for the segment, I'd like to share a few notable first quarter MedTech events that demonstrate our stated aspirations of entering higher-growth market segments and continuing to build upon digital technologies across the portfolio. Two acquisitions were closed in the quarter, CrossRoads Extremity with a differentiated portfolio of bunion and hammertoes solutions in the fast-growing elective foot and ankle market; and CUPTIMIZE, which will be a new addition to the VELYS digital surgery platform of connected technologies. The CUPTIMIZE solution is designed to give surgeons an easy-to-use tool to better understand and address the impact of abnormal motion between the spine and pelvis in some patients who require total hip arthroplasty and may help reduce the risk of dislocation related to pelvic tilt. I am also pleased to share that Fast Company selected Johnson & Johnson MedTech as one its top 10 World's Most Innovative Health Companies of 2022, recognizing MedTech's success and commitment to delivering breakthrough scientific innovation and reimagining health in an increasingly digital world. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 17.4%, with double-digit growth in both the US and OUS regions, driven primarily by success of new products in electrophysiology, commercial execution and continued market recovery. Worldwide surgery grew 5%, driven by strong performance in wound closure and biosurgery where we continue to gain market share. MONARCH-enabled procedures now exceed 14,000 since launch, providing continued evidence of the adoption of MONARCH technology in patient treatment regimens. The worldwide Orthopedics franchise grew 5.6%, reflecting COVID-19 recovery, continued penetration in the US ambulatory surgery center channel or ASCs; and penetration of new product launches, such as enhancements to VELYS hip navigation, VELYS robotic-assisted solution and ATTUNE cementless knee system. Partially offsetting this growth was softness in spine procedures in the US. The worldwide Vision franchise continued its double-digit growth, growing 13.9% this quarter. Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the US and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, driven by unfavorable mix in the MedTech business and commodity inflation in the Consumer Health business. Sales, marketing and administrative deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by higher brand marketing expenses in Consumer Health and timing of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical segment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. The $3.5 billion investment was an 8.9% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. In process, research and development reflects an impairment expense of $610 million for certain indications associated with bermekimab, the investigational compound acquired from XBiotech Inc. as disclosed in our previous SEC filings. This impairment was driven by the termination of development of bermekimab for atopic dermatitis based on efficacy data. The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Calyx and EBRA in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year. The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower US income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior year divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.1% to 35.1% due to product mix, commodity inflation, increased brand marketing expense, portfolio progression in R&D and comparisons to gains from prior year divestitures. Pharmaceutical margin declined from 45.5% to 44.1%, primarily driven by timing of brand marketing expenses and general portfolio progression in R&D. MedTech margins declined from 30.6% to 27%, driven by unfavorable product mix. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 26.8% to 22.1%, due to commodity inflation and higher brand marketing expenses. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call back over to Joe Wolk. Joe Wolk : As Jess just mentioned, Johnson & Johnson posted solid performance for the quarter, continuing to invest in the business for the long-term success, while overcoming multiple macroeconomic headwinds, including inflationary pressures and higher input costs. These external challenges include limited availability and rising prices of certain commodities; as well as increased costs for labor, energy and transportation. These impacts are pervasive across the enterprise, but most notable in Consumer Health. We expect these pressures will continue to some degree throughout the remainder of 2022. However, mitigation efforts are underway, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. We are committed to sustaining supply of the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients want and need. Turning to our segments and notable events in the quarter. MedTech led our enterprise performance with nearly 9% adjusted operational sales growth. We continue to drive this business forward and are increasing the value of our pipeline through innovation, internally and externally. We were pleased to see a steady uptick in surgical procedures this quarter with the easing of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world, but we recognize that the situation is fluid, which requires monitoring. Building on more than 20 major new product launches in 2021, MedTech announced the addition of two new innovations to our ATTUNE portfolio, the ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing knee with AFFIXIUM 3DP Technology and the ATTUNE medial stabilized knee system. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver above-market growth driven by volume as evidenced by our recently published 2021 Janssen US Transparency Report, which reflects our fifth consecutive year of price decreases across the portfolio despite inflationary pressures. We also continue to advance our Pharmaceutical pipeline. This quarter, we received FDA approval for Carvykti, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with our partner, Legend Biotech. We are partnering with clinics utilizing a phased approach to begin patient dosing, and the feedback to date has been positive. We also filed Teclistamab, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody seeking EMA approval, and we also received priority review from the FDA, potentially expanding our multiple myeloma portfolio further. In our Consumer Health business, we remain focused on delivering on our 2022 performance objectives, continuing to achieve above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while navigating industry-wide supply constraints that have primarily impacted our Skin Health/Beauty business. We continue to be excited about the activity related to the announcement we made in November on the creation of two new industry-leading companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health Company. For the new Johnson & Johnson, the portfolio will remain well diversified with 25 brands delivering over $1 billion in sales annually, holding market-leading positions across key therapeutic areas and franchises. The financial hallmarks of Johnson & Johnson will remain the same, including a well-defined capital allocation strategy, a disciplined approach to inorganic growth and a strong balance sheet, while also creating opportunities to sharpen focus on execution and clinically differentiated innovation. The new Consumer Health Company will also have a strong financial profile and be better positioned to drive incremental growth, realizing increased potential in new markets through a more agile operating model. The company will continue to deliver science-backed innovation and enhanced digital consumer-centric solutions. The Consumer Health separation team is making substantial progress related to our efforts in establishing the new independent company. As previously mentioned, we cannot disclose new financial information specific to Consumer Health in order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways. Our time lines remain unchanged. We anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health Company in the coming months, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with previous communications, we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment adhering to the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow for the quarter of nearly $3.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $30 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $3 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Internal innovation remains critical to our future growth and a top priority. In the first quarter, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps or play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. As I mentioned earlier, we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 60th consecutive year from $1.06 per share to $1.13 per share, an increase of 6.6%. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations. I'll start with comments on our COVID-19 vaccine and foreign exchange impacts, essentially the only items with updates from our January guidance. As market demand for all COVID-19 vaccines is currently challenged by global supply surplus and vaccine hesitancy in developing markets, we have made the decision to suspend guidance for sales of our COVID-19 vaccine. This will enable investors to focus on the performance of our core businesses, which drive the current and future value for investors. We are maintaining the total adjusted operational earnings per share guidance we provided in January, absorbing, if need be, the modest income impact from the COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding foreign exchange, as you know, we don't offer guidance or predictions on currency movements. But to give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.08, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.1 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.25 for reported adjusted earnings per share versus the calculation related to January's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $2.5 billion on reported sales and $0.45 on reported adjusted earnings per share. All other line items for which we provide guidance remain the same as communicated in January. To reiterate, we are maintaining our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do understand that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations as you update your models. In Consumer Health, we expect supply constraints to continue throughout the year but not to the same extent in the second half. As a result, we anticipate that the back half performance will improve over the first half. For MedTech, while the first quarter demonstrated faster recovery than we anticipated, our full year expectations remain fairly intact. We anticipate continued market recovery and uptake from recently launched products and are monitoring the ever-changing COVID dynamics, particularly the surging cases in China. Similar to Consumer Health, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. As a reminder, with respect to growth rates, the second quarter was the strongest quarter for MedTech in 2021. The expectations for the Pharmaceutical base business remain the same. We anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth with relatively consistent growth throughout the remainder of the year. In summary, Johnson & Johnson had a solid start to the year despite managing macroeconomic headwinds, and we remain confident in our business. I would like to recognize the continued efforts of our 144,000 global colleagues focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions to our credo stakeholders. Their unwavering dedication and support continue to inspire. And on behalf of the executive team, I'd like to extend our gratitude. I am now pleased to welcome to the call, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, our Worldwide Chairs to address your questions. Kevin, can you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So many different places to go. But Joe, I'll start with M&A. You know, there were comments on the tape stating that you're eager to deploy cash to M&A, especially for devices. So maybe for you or Ashley, can you add more color to your thinking there and the types of opportunities to consider? You know, you've talked about reaching the top of the peer set in devices. That would seem to require a relatively large deal or a series of small to medium-sized deals to move the needle. Is that a fair way to think about it? Thanks for taking the question. Joe Wolk : Yes. So Larry, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Ashley for some thoughts specific on Medical Devices. But before I answer, Larry, I do want to compliment you and your team for the foreign exchange report that you guys issued back, I think it was on April 13. That was just -- it's a tough topic to really grasp. And you guys did a fantastic job in assessing what it meant for the medical device industry. It was really a fantastic report. So well done. With respect to cash, as you heard us in January, we are reaching our lowest levels of net debt. And we remain very active. You could talk to Thibaut, Jennifer and Ashley, with respect to ideas that they are bringing forth. We continue to have the same principles that we've had historically. We want to make sure there's a strategic fit. And by that, I simply mean we've got capabilities. We've got scientific expertise. Perhaps it's just our scale that adds more value to that asset than where it currently resides. And then we want to make sure that we compensate risk -- compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf when we do so. I would not get overly locked into size. Johnson & Johnson, quite frankly, have been built through a number of smaller acquisitions, and really the outliers are these larger acquisitions. But we look at really the strategic merit and then the financial value creation and don't get locked in to saying something is too small or too big with respect to adding to our already dynamic internal portfolio and pipeline. Ashley, I don't know if you want to... Ashley McEvoy : Yes. No, Larry, maybe before I get to M&A, just kind of some macro thoughts on MedTech in the quarter. I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We saw positive signs of the market recovery. Clearly, while COVID has not disappeared, health systems around the world are becoming increasingly more resistant with each passing wave. And as we know, the world is -- is a lot more equipped to manage the pandemic, and quite frankly, so is Johnson & Johnson. So encouraged to see in quarter one that we continue to maintain our path to above-market performance. We referenced that this is kind of a growth at scale, if you will, 11, $1 billion platforms, really most of them growing or maintaining share. And we saw robust sales growth across all four of our franchises in all four of our regions. Some standout, encouraging to see both vision surgery and Vision Care, both double-digit performance and growing market share, really fueled by innovation in ACUVUE and TECNIS. We are the world leader in electrophysiology, still a category that has significant under penetration. We've had 11 consecutive years of double-digit performance and really significantly enhanced our share gain. We're the world leader in biosurgery. The business was up almost 10%, really driven by a clinically differentiated portfolio. And then finally, and enthusiastically, I say we had strong performance in joints really by penetrating some new sites of care like ASCs, both with hips and knees. So when I look forward, I'm encouraged by the organic agenda that we see in innovation, like with the likes of the FDA approval on ACUVUE Theravision, the first drug-eluting contact lens. As Joe mentioned earlier, around really shoring up high-growth segments in knees with ATTUNE fixed bearing, and then really with CERENOVUS the launch of EmboGad, the balloon catheter. So continue to advance robotics and digital surgery. You'll hear us talk about MONARCH 14,000 cases with a big pipeline of new indications, and then VELYS completing over 2,000 cases. So when I think about the future of M&A, Larry, we're going to continue to do tuck-ins and to really digitize the patient experience. You heard us talk about CUPTIMIZE as an example around really adding a precise delivery to hit navigation to improve outcomes. You're going to see us continue to penetrate fast-growing segments like what we have in neurovascular, as an example, 90% of our capital deployment has been to $1 billion or more, but we do intend to make sure that we are well positioned to be in the highest growth end state markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe Ashley, just following up on some of your MedTech comments. Can you specifically comment on China in terms of the impact you're currently seeing to the business and your outlook for that market specifically, given some of the lockdowns that we're seeing there? And then my kind of core question was just on IMBRUVICA. It seems like prescriptions here are really starting to see some erosion. I'm trying to understand the dynamics you're expecting going forward. So is this -- especially maybe in the US market, are you expecting that this erosion continues? Or do you see dynamics in place that we could start to see some of those prescription trends start to stabilize a bit? Thanks so much. Ashley McEvoy : Yeah, sure, Chris. So first, we have, I would say, a very strong and healthy business in China. We're the world \u2013 we are number one in MedTech in China. We have a very diversified portfolio from surgery to orthopedics to interventional as well as vision. We did experience an impact probably in the March time frame due to the recent surge of the viruses happening and the lockdowns, particularly in Shanghai and now other regions. We do anticipate that to continue in April and through the month of May. But like we've seen, I think China might come down a bit faster, but it comes back faster, too. We have very strong leadership there, and there are a lot of patients that need care. I'll turn it to Jennifer maybe to talk about your second question. Jennifer Taubert : Great. Thanks a lot. Hi, Chris and hello, everybody. A few comments on the Pharmaceutical business, and then I'll get to the question on IMBRUVICA. First, for our pharm business, I was really proud that we delivered $12.9 billion in worldwide sales. We're definitely above-market adjusted operational growth of 9.3%. And this is our sixth quarter where we achieved worldwide sales exceeding $12 billion. And as I look across the globe, the growth was really broadly based across our portfolio in the regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. During the course of the quarter, we really continued to maximize the value of our key brands, so strong double-digit growth across six of them, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, [Privado] (ph) and EDURANT. And we also had a number of important milestones, the first being the FDA approval of Carvykti, which is our first cell therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The teclistamab filing in the EU was mentioned. The FDA approved expanded label indications for CABENUVA to be administered every two months for the treatment of HIV in virologically suppressed adults and adolescents. And we presented great new data on TREMFYA in our approved indications of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as from our Phase II studies, where we're evaluating the product in Crohn's Disease and also in UC. So if we take a look at IMBRUVICA more specifically, IMBRUVICA sales did decline for the quarter, 3.9%, and this really was a US story. Outside the US, our sales actually grew 4.5%. In the US, performance was impacted by both competitive factors with a number of new competitors in the market as well as market softness. We haven't seen that market fully rebound to the pre-COVID levels yet. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA has really changed the standard of care for adults with CLL and other B-cell malignancies. And it is the only BTKI that\u2019s demonstrated overall survival and a high rate of progression-free survival at five years with up to eight years of safety follow-up. So, we remain really confident in the efficacy and safety profile of the product. It's the market share leader and continues to be the most comprehensively studied and prescribed BTKI with over 250,000 patients worldwide. So we continue to work to develop the asset. We do see further growth opportunities through the introduction of new indications and new combination therapies, as we take a look at IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax that we're working to develop and we filed in the EU. We're also taking a look at first line [ph] and CL and really trying to bring that forward. So I think you can anticipate there will continue to be strong competition in that market. We continue to believe in and invest in IMBRUVICA. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about the middle of the income statement with all of the multiple headwinds on those factors. How do you think about managing it? What are the levers to pull? And how do you think about raising prices in this environment for each of your key divisions? Joe Wolk : Yes, good morning, Joanne. Thanks for the question. With respect to operating margins overall, which is really, I think, at the heart of your question, in the front -- the first quarter, I should say, we do tend to adopt a little bit more of an aggressive approach to advertising and promotion and hopes of getting the full year benefit of that promotion to the topline lift throughout the year. And I would say on R&D, it's also a little bit front-end loaded this year, simply from the standpoint of the progression of our pharmaceutical pipeline, as well as digital robotic surgery. So in pharmaceuticals, think about nipocalimab, our RSV vaccine, those had very nice progression. Teclistamab may be moving a little bit faster than we anticipated, as well as being able to launch Carvykti. There was a healthy amount of inflation built into our P&L in the January guidance. What I think our teams have seen in the -- let's say, the first four months of this year is an uptick in that inflationary impact of about 10% or 15%. So still very manageable. Again, as you heard in some of the prepared remarks, we anticipate that that inflationary pressure as well as commodity scarcity will subside a little bit in the second quarter and then hopefully more pronounced in the second half of this year. If it doesn't, it's certainly something that will keep our attention. And we have the resources to adjust accordingly to make sure that we not only meet the needs of long-term value creation, but also meet short-term performance expectations. So we all think it's very manageable at this point in time, but it's something that we're not taking for granted. We're being very active with cost initiative programs. As we look to separate the two companies, we are looking at ways to streamline technology, processes, things that will lead to leverage on the P&L. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Perhaps directed at the Pharmaceutical segment for Jennifer. Two products I'd like to focus on, one being STELARA and the other on XARELTO. With STELARA, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit more in terms of some of the underlying dynamics across the various indications, i.e., the derm versus perhaps the IBD in terms of what the growth trends and outlook you're seeing and you expect there? And then for XARELTO, part of your commentary in the prepared segment discussed and mentioned about patient access. Could you just elaborate a little bit further on how that was an impact on the commercial dynamics? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Sure. Thanks for the question. So let me start off with STELARA. So STELARA sales were $2.29 billion in the first quarter, and that was 9% growth. And we continue to see a lot of strength in STELARA. Ex-US, the product had nearly 18% growth. In the US, what we saw was growth around 3.6%. And what this really was due to, we saw an impact in the US due to the Omicron variant and the impact that it actually had on staffing resources that particularly impacted a number of areas where you had more resource-intensive delivery of care, and GI offices was definitely one. As we take a look at Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, our share positions remain strong and with very strong positive momentum. We actually gained over five share points in CD and six share points in ulcerative colitis. So really strong growth and momentum. And with -- in psoriasis, as anticipated with TREMFYA and a very strong growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we expected the STELARA sales there to start tailing off, and that's in line with our expectations. So we continue to have a very strong positive outlook for STELARA going through the rest of the year in CD and in Crohn's -- excuse me, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, where we've really been realizing the growth. And likewise, when you take a look at TREMFYA, we saw 44.5% growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. So together, really, really nice performance there. Question on XARELTO. So XARELTO in the US, we did see sales decline. That was largely driven by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment. And most of this has actually been a positive adjustment that took place in 2021. So when you do the comparable, it was negative. And so that was really due to the vast majority of that. With Xarelto, we continue to see nice share gains and growth at a prescription level across the indications, whether we're talking about CAD and PAD, really the newest indication set, but also across AFib and VTE. And so it really was around the net unfavorable PPA and a little bit of channel mix as well with some of the mix shifting into 340B and Medicaid in some of the lower-priced channels. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about CARVYKTI. And what gives you confidence in your ability to meet some of the manufacturing complexity associated with CARVYKTI? And how much capacity do you think you'll be able to bring online this year, both in the US and potentially globally as well? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Thanks for the question. So we're real proud about our approval and our launch to-date on CARVYKTI. What I can say is that it is going well and it is on track with our expectations. We're real pleased. As you know, this is a customized therapy where the supply chain is literally built around each patient. We've got about a four week to five week period that goes from the collection of the cells, the processing and manufacturing and the return shipment of the final product and then ultimately the infusion back in to the patient at the treatment center. As we have mentioned before we really are taking a thoughtful and a phased approach to scaling this launch, to ensure a predictable and a reliable experience for the patients and for the treatment centers. We really tried to learn from the other launches in the market in this area. And so far, we're off to a really good start there and have been very pleased with the feedback that we're getting back from our customers. So we have activated our initial round of treatment centers. And we did this based on folks who were very well-experienced from our clinical trials and also very broadly dispersed throughout the US and help ensure patient access. We're working through all of the orders and the slots that we have and actually have product now that's been shipped back -- has been manufactured and shipped back to the patients for infusion into the patients. So we're going to continue in a planned and thoughtful responsible approach to this scaling, both in the United States as well as we do -- as we scale outside the US and throughout the world as well. Now we discussed before around lentivirus. Because there is an industry-wide shortage of lentivirus, that is something that we are also working and investing in to scale all of our internal capabilities to be able to meet the demand, both now in our initial launches in the relapsed/refractory setting as well as our ultimate goal to be able to move into first-line setting here. And so we would have an internal control on that as well. So hope this answers your question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Joe, since Joaquin made some public commentary on his commitment to support Ashley and her team to drive revenue growth acceleration in the Mega Devices unit, your focus has been on M&A opportunities. But how should we think about the level of internal investment to fuel growth of the devices franchise? You don't break out the percentage of R&D spend allocated to devices. But one data point we do have is from the 2019 pharma day when you related $8.4 billion of the $11 billion in R& D expense from 2018 went to pharma initiatives, so that's north of 75%. But just \u2013 I mean, has that stepped up just the level of investment in the Devices business over the last couple of years? And will that step up even further? And just to be clear, Ashley did not plant this question with our team. Joe Wolk : I'm going to check the transcript on that, Josh, just to be sure. But listen, I think what you would hear, as Joaquin was sitting here, is that he supports all the businesses with respect to innovation. We realize that our calling card is innovation, and we're going to have growth across all of our franchises when we have products that matter that are differentiated, that are beyond the current standard of care and meeting consumer needs as well. I actually want to credit Ashley and her team for the way they've managed their P&L. They've been conscious about moving more of their investment into R&D. You saw a record number of 20 plus new product launches last year that are considered meaningful. We're going to be very close to probably a very similar number this year. And so that portfolio has taken very much the same approach that I would say Pharmaceuticals did almost a decade ago when the focus is very well understood and where we want to play because we've got a strategic or competitive advantage will be capitalized upon. I don't know, Ashley, if you want to add anything more, but I think that certainly, there is continued support, but a lot of the credit goes to Ashley and her team in terms of managing their levels of investment throughout the P&L. Ashley McEvoy : Thanks, Joe. I mean, Josh, I would say that we are investing at a competitive level, and I'm really pleased with the state of execution. We are \u2013 we have, in our pipeline right now, 27, $100 million-plus eNPV projects. That number three years ago was six. So they continue to focus the pipeline on medium to higher growth segments and really execute and we're off to a good start in 2022. Joe Wolk : I would maybe underscore too is that gives us the confidence to go out and add in inorganic opportunities when the opportunity presents itself using the criteria of strategic fit as well as financial value creation. So a stronger internal pipeline that gets hopefully success out in the acquisition markets. Jennifer Taubert : Just to reference our 10-K, we do provide the breakout of R&D by segment on an annual basis for reference. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Jennifer, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the COVID recovery in the Pharma segment. I know you touched on staffing issues on the gas trip [Audio Gap]? Jennifer Taubert : Yeah. So I understand Terry's comment really was around the US and what we're seeing in terms of COVID. So as we exited last year, really in the December time frame and entered this year into really January and February, we did see the Omicron variant impact the US business. And what we saw there really, as already mentioned before, we did see staffing shortages because so many people got sick. People weren't able to go into work. And so in a higher \u2013 more intensive resource settings in some of the markets, we did see slowdown in terms of delayed visits and new patient starts. What we are seeing now is we're looking towards the end of March and in early April, we're seeing nice recovery there. And so this really, hopefully was something really just at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and it does look to be more specific to the US than to any of the other markets. Joe Wolk : Thanks. Jennifer. Thibaut, maybe give some insight, too, on the consumer segment and how COVID is impacting. Obviously, it was much more tumultuous I'd say, in 2020 and 2021. But what are you seeing to the early start of this year? Thibaut Mongon : Look, clearly, we continue to see the impact of COVID on the life of our consumers. And that has an impact -- the differentiated impact by category. We are looking at China very specifically right now to see how the situation evolves there. What I would say that COVID has really shifted consumer behavior to digital space and digital solutions. And so -- and we see it in the continued growth of our e-commerce channel, representing more and more of our business. So that's what makes all more resilient is ability to count on multiple channels is something that is showing us well in a provident environment. Having said that, we need to continue to monitor how the situation evolves around the world. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Matt Miksic : Thanks. Thank so much for taking the question. So maybe for Ashley. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on med devices in Q1 and the trajectory exiting March. You had pretty impressive growth across the board, so congrats on that. But investors are often trying to think to just figure out the difference between inpatient segments like orthopedics or cardio or advanced surgery and how those are recovering potentially at different rates in the US? And what you might be seeing there? As well as any color you could provide on how, say, Europe and Japan overseas developed markets compared with the recovery trends we've seen in the US? Thanks. Ashley McEvoy : Thanks, Matt for the question. And it's April 2022, we're still talking about this, so just huge acknowledgment for our health care workers who are still battling through this. But I would tell you, EMEA really bounced back nicely in quarter one. It was pretty broad-based within EMEA. I would say, Asia with the exception of China recently also bounced back, and then US really gained momentum. I always look at two data points in the US as an example. I look at like, how were diagnostic procedures performing in the US and then how are surgical procedures performing. And probably at our trough when Omicron was hitting in the US in January, we had about flat diagnostic procedures, and we were looking at surgical procedures down near double digit, down 10%. Encouragingly, as we exited March, we started to see diagnostic procedures tick up to high single digit and start to see a flattening of surgical procedures. I expect in the month of April in the US to see it go north of 2019 levels, really driven by cardio cardiac ablation, bariatrics and colorectal surgery. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I just had a couple. Jennifer, in the myeloma market, we'll see REVLIMID generic soon. And I realize that combinations with DARZALEX are standard of care, but what are your expectations for broader market disruption going forward, either from a pricing or share perspective? And then a quick follow-up on the M&A front for Joe. When you think about the P&L or cash flow impact from the consumer separation, to what degree does this inform or impact plans for a larger scale BD or M&A for either a MedTech or Pharma? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : So thanks for the opportunity to talk about our multiple myeloma portfolio in response to your question. So as we take a look at the myeloma market despite the advances to date in therapies, there is still so much unmet need there, given the underlying heterogeneity of the disease. And so it's really important that there are treatment choices. And what we're really trying to do is to have a strong portfolio of highly effected -- highly effective treatments and actually ultimately shoot for a cure. And so as we take a look at the market with DARZALEX -- in DARZALEX FASPRO right now, we're really seeing this as a foundational therapy multiple myeloma. And so irrespective of others and LOE and those types of things, you noted, it's a lot of combination therapy and things like that. That does not fundamentally change the opportunity for DARZALEX and FASPRO. What I'm also really excited about is then you add in CARVYKTI that was recently approved, as we mentioned, for triple refractory multiple myeloma. And we really think that this will ultimately become a preferred treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also mentioned teclistamab in the filing of teclistamab. And this really is the first-ever BCMA CD3 specific. And we think that this is going to be a great off-the-shelf option and for patients who really are triple-class exposed and who are really not eligible for CARVYKTI or don't have access. And then in the future, we're not stopping there. We're also working on Talquetamab, and this would be the first and potentially best-in-class GPRC5D bispecific that we think could be potentially sequenced combined to help transform outcomes. And so as we take a look at our portfolio, we really think that these assets are additive and complementary versus something where they would be cannibalizing each other. And we really think that these are the important advances that are going to really help transform multiple myeloma in the future and going forward versus any of the older therapies. Joe Wolk : And Geoff, with respect to cash flow and M&A, I think I'll answer that in two parts. I think short term, we certainly have the credit rating to warrant more firepower should we need it. As you have observed, our cash flow generation over the last couple of years has ticked up to new levels, north of $20 billion or around $20 billion from when we were just maybe $17 billion a few years ago. As the consumer company operates, I think that's going to be actually liberating for both sides. We still have opportunities to improve our cash flow with inventory management and receivables. But as we move to a higher growth segment, we think we'll be able to generate similar cash flow with a higher level of sales growth, managing the P&L appropriately. So I've got every confidence that we'll be able to do small, medium and large scale acquisitions should the right opportunity present itself. I also think it's liberating for the Consumer Health segment because they'll be able to focus their cash flow generation to value-creating opportunities through their particular lens being fit for purpose in a digitized environment that Thibaut spoke to. So whether it's near-term or long-term, I think we're in a very good position to utilize today's cash and hopefully that which should we generate tomorrow. Kevin, maybe we've got time for one more question? Operator : Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. This is a question for Ashley. And is the commentary around the ASC penetration. And I'm just curious, Ashley, as that site of care becomes increasingly important, where you guys think you are relative to the market from a penetration perspective? And where you think you can grow meaningful growth driver will your recent success in the ASC be over the next few years? Thanks so much. Ashley McEvoy : Well, thank you, Danielle. Appreciate the question and hope you are well. We -- in US, the ASCs, I think, are -- it's still relatively low penetration, I would tell, from a macro US, less than 20%, but I think it's the fastest growing as we know. In a COVID environment, we've seen the model evolve to create a safe, more patient-friendly experience that addresses a patient sentiment of not wanting to go into a hospital setting. Certain procedures have gone there early sooner than later. I'd say hips or migraine and knees, less spine per se, less complicated. Obviously, trauma case is still happening in the hospital setting. We've done a lot of work recently to modify our business model to make it a capital-efficient flow, if you will, in inventory management, on the personalization of care using digital assets to kind of your pre-op and your post-op experience less full of friction. And we're taking a lot of experience in the US ASCs to really what we're doing in China in the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities as well as we deliver care. So I'm optimistic that this channel will continue to evolve. I do think that we think we start competitiveness there, and we're making sure that we really have a sustainable business model going forward. Thank you. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those who we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks. Joe Wolk : Great. Thanks, Jess. And as Jess alluded to, we certainly do appreciate your questions and the chance to interact with you. I'd like to remind everybody as we close that we do have the opportunity to engage with shareholders at next week's annual meeting on April 28. Also be on the lookout for an update on our commitments to ESG. On June 8, we will be issuing our Health for Humanity Report, which is an in-depth review on the progress we are making on our 2025 goals. Thank you for your time and your interest in Johnson & Johnson. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Please note that today\u2019s meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company\u2019s consumer health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today\u2019s date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC\u2019s website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These slides acknowledge those relationships. Joaquin Duato : Good morning, everyone. This is Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thanks for joining us today. I am accompanied by Joe Wolk and Jessica Moore and we have the privilege to share our second quarter financial results and answer questions you have regarding Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business. During my first 6 months as CEO, I have had the opportunity to reconnect in person with colleagues, customers and stakeholders around the world. These conversations have energized me about the future of Johnson & Johnson. They have also made clear the critical role our company plays as a leader in bringing innovative healthcare solutions to patients and customers both today and long into the future. And they further validated that the three strategic priorities I outlined earlier this year will continue to guide us in 2022 as we deliver on our mission to transform the future of human health. Let me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our pharmaceutical business review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the STELARA loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%. In the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of CARVYKTI in April. And in May, we received conditional marketing authorization in Europe. In addition, talquetamab was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in June. I have great confidence in the strength of our current portfolio, which remains underappreciated, and in our robust pipeline to meet our long-term goals and to deliver transformational medicines that help improve and save lives. Our second priority, continue to strengthen our performance in MedTech. Over the past several years, this acceleration in performance has been driven by the delivery of differentiated solutions as well as improved commercial execution. We expect this improvement to continue, enabled by our innovative pipeline as well as the potential for expansion into higher growth market segments. Currently, 11 MedTech platforms each delivered over $1 billion in revenue annually. And based on the most recent results, we are gaining or holding share in nearly all of these. With the positive momentum in this business and our improvement in competitiveness, MedTech has delivered 6% adjusted operational growth in the first half of 2022. We believe MedTech will continue to be a significant source of value for our investors and our stakeholders. Third, we are separating our Consumer Health business to create two market leading standalone companies. This separation can be a significant opportunity for value creation. The two new global entities will be well positioned to thrive in their respective markets and drive greater strategic and financial success. We are making excellent progress and remain on track to complete the separation in 2023. In the second quarter, we announced the global leadership team for the new Consumer Health organization led by Thibaut Mongon as CEO designate and Paul Ruh as CFO designate. Having worked with both Thibaut and Paul for many years, I am confident we have selected the right leadership team to lead the new Consumer Health company in its next chapter. The new Johnson & Johnson comprising our pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world, with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher growth markets across both segments, while maintaining our strong dividend distribution. With these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives. We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5% respectively. Joe and Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and Consumer Health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth, while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years. I look forward to addressing your questions soon. But for now, I will turn the call over to Jessica Moore to discuss those details. Jess? Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joaquin. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional material, including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. We continue to implement enhancements in order to assist you in evaluating our performance. In addition to today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today\u2019s call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules. I will now review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary, before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let\u2019s move to second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 3% versus the second quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8% as currency had a negative impact of 5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 3.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 13.9%, with currency negatively impacting our reported o-U.S. results by 10.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.1% worldwide, 2.4% in the U.S. and 14.2% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share, was $1.80 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.35 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 4.3% and 4.4% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 10.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. As stated last quarter, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health, worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 1.3%, with a decline of 3.6% in the U.S. and growth of 0.6% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 3.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 2.9%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC outside the U.S. due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and digestive health category recovery. This growth was partially offset by a weaker allergy season and supply constraints in the U.S., although these have improved from prior quarters. Furthermore, the Consumer Health business was negatively impacted by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions, mainly affecting the Skin Health/Beauty franchise. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.3 billion increased 6.7%, with growth of 4.2% in the U.S. and 9.8% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 12.3% as currency had a negative impact of 5.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 12.4%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.6%. Results in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable prior period adjustments offset by favorable discounts. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, STELARA, ERLEADA and TREMFYA, along with our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, which was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with the decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong operational sales growth with increases of 46.1% and 56.9% respectively. STELARA growth of 18.6% was driven by strong market growth and meaningful share gains in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. This represents 5.4 points and 7.4 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter benefited from favorable discounts partially offset by unfavorable prior period adjustments for a net favorable impact of approximately 400 basis points. TREMFYA grew 29.7%, driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This represents 2.3 points and 3.2 points of share gain respectively in the U.S. Results in the quarter were impacted by an unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 750 basis points in unfavorable patient mix. IMBRUVICA operational sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competition particularly in the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive operational growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.9 billion decreased 1.1%, with growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and declines of 3.6% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.4% as currency had a negative impact of 4.5 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 3.4%. Operational sales also grew sequentially versus the prior quarter despite headwinds related to regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions as well as labor and supply constraints. Drivers for growth across the MedTech business include procedure recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share positions in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms, each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. For additional context, all franchises were affected by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions and selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2022. I\u2019d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased supply network-related cost with the COVID-19 vaccine and inflation, partially offset by favorable mix. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.7 billion invested was a 9.1% increase versus the prior year primarily due to portfolio progression in pharmaceutical and MedTech. The other income and expense line was an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by litigation, higher unrealized losses on securities and consumer health separation costs in the current year, partially offset by favorable employee benefit plan-related items. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.6% versus 5.8% in the same period last year. This was primarily driven by a 2021 one-time tax benefit from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.4% versus 14.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let\u2019s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 33.4% to 34%, primarily driven by favorable product and segment mix, partially offset by inflation and portfolio progression in R&D. Pharmaceutical margin improved from 39.4% to 42%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and brand marketing expense leverage. MedTech margins declined from 28.6% to 26.5%, driven by inflation, unfavorable product mix and increased investments to support new product launches and research and development. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 28.6% to 25.9% due to commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies and one-time favorable items in 2021. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jess. As Joaquin and Jess commented, our results remained solid across our three segments in the second quarter and through the first half of 2022, particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, select countries experiencing continuing impact from COVID-19 and geopolitical matters. Our sustainable, resilient business continues to deliver on the robust operational guidance that we set forth at the beginning of the year, while advancing breakthrough innovation and fostering patient access to make a positive impact across many areas of healthcare. As previously discussed, we did build in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. As for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter. As Joaquin noted, we are focused on continuing the strong cadence of innovation in this business, which includes launches such as the next-generation ECHELON 3000 Stapler, a digitally enabled device demonstrating improved patient outcomes based on clinical evidence. It also includes the EMBOGUARD balloon guide catheter, designed to optimize the removal of blood clots and reduce procedure time in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pharmaceuticals, we continued to advance our pipeline and delivered operational sales growth of 8.6%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter, notably above what we delivered in the first quarter of this year. We continue to outpace the market. During the second quarter, we recorded our first sales in the U.S. of CARVYKTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with Legend Biotech and received European Commission approval in May. We also presented new data across our broad oncology portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association in June. If you haven\u2019t done so already, I encourage you to listen to the fireside chat with Peter Lee Woods, a global R&D Head of Oncology, about this promising new data, which can be found on our website. A quick update on our COVID-19 vaccine for which we suspended sales guidance last quarter, recognizing the global progress on vaccine development and distribution against COVID-19 and the amount of existing global supply, we are modifying our COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments. This will result in incremental costs for the year, which will be reflected as a special item. We are proud of the role our vaccine continues to play in the fight against COVID-19. In our Consumer Health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year\u2019s strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while overcoming industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our Skin Health business. We continue to be excited about the creation of the new consumer health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction. We look forward to sharing the new Consumer Health company\u2019s name and branding as well as the headquarter\u2019s location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022. Finally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of approximately $8 billion in the first half of the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $32.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately $32.6 billion of debt for a net neutral cash position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Investing in innovation that delivers meaningful products to address unmet needs continues to be our top priority. In the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations, the major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis. Regarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021. Regarding interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we have reduced the expense to a neutral position. Again, given year-to-date trends, we are increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to reflect the favorable impact of employee benefit-related items. That may appear light given the current run rate, but we have some one-time items such as real estate sales and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. gains, which we don\u2019t expect to repeat in the second half of this year. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression. As we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April\u2019s guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it\u2019s not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven\u2019t seen in nearly 2 decades. It\u2019s also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring, a dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period. In addition, while it\u2019s much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact maybe if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023\u2019s EPS. Certainly, there is a long way to go before we finalize next year\u2019s outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact. Back to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In Consumer Health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2021 had lower growth than the third quarter, resulting in an easier comparison. For MedTech, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, driven by market recovery from continued enhancement of our competitive position through commercial execution and uptake from our recently launched products. We expect the fourth quarter 2022 to be slightly stronger than the third quarter. COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, and we continue to monitor any related impacts. For Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year. To close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we\u2019d like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions and results for all of our credo stakeholders. Joaquin, Jess and I will now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those participants on the call wishing to ask a question? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part on the myeloma franchise obviously, another very strong quarter for DARZALEX, just wondering where conversion of subcu stands in the U.S. and Europe? And then the second part relates to, if you can share any metrics on the early CARVYKTI launch. Joe, I know you called that out, but just any insight there and then progress on increasing the supply of that product? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. So, thank you for the question. And let me start giving you a perspective on our myeloma franchise, which is one of the areas of strength for our Pharmaceutical business. On one hand, we continue to have a great progression with DARZALEX with 47% growth in this quarter. And Jess will update you on the exact numbers of the conversion from subcu to \u2013 from IV to subcu. What are the exact numbers? Jessica Moore : Yes. In the U.S., we\u2019re about 85%. In Europe, we\u2019re around 80%. Joaquin Duato : Okay. So it continues to move in the right direction, given the enhanced convenience and ease of use for the patient that our subcu formulation offers. So DARZALEX is doing very well, and we feel very confident about the continuous progression of DARZALEX. On the other hand, we are also proud of the commercial launch of CARVYKTI in the U.S. following FDA approval and also the recent approval of CARVYKTI in EMEA. And together with that, to complement the strength of our myeloma franchise, we have received recently two breakthrough designations on our CD3 redirectors, one for teclistamab and another one for talquetamab. So we are proud to have a very comprehensive myeloma franchise that, due to its breadth, will enable us to award to try to convert myeloma into \u2013 from an uncurable disease to a chronic disease and potentially when they occur by sequencing and combining this treatment. So great idea of strength for the Pharmaceutical business of Johnson & Johnson, and it\u2019s an area that connects on how we are executing in our pipeline and progressing and what we discussed in our November R&D Day, where we portray our Pharmaceutical pipeline as one of the important drivers of us being able to achieve a $60 billion number in 2025. So it\u2019s a good sign of how we are progressing in our pipeline and in our existing portfolio with DARZALEX. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just I\u2019ll ask a high-level macro question. So Joaquin and Joe, at a high level, what are your assumptions for the macro headwinds in the second half? Joe, what\u2019s getting better? What\u2019s not? I\u2019m sure people would love to hear about input costs and inflation; COVID trends around the world, especially China; and lastly, hospital labor shortages. Thanks so much for taking the question. Joe Wolk : Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry and again, another nice job with the currency reporting. The macro headwinds, I would say, I would classify it as kind of two categories. The first is really around supply constraints, some of what we commented to at the end of last year that kind of persisted into the first part of this year. I would say that was primarily in our Consumer franchise, where product supply and availability inputs, if you will, were somewhat constrained. We are seeing, I would say, an alleviation of some of those constraints, and that\u2019s why we anticipate, specifically in our Skin Health and Beauty business to be much stronger in the second half. We know that point-of-sale demand continues to be strong for products like Aveeno and NEUTROGENA and we just didn\u2019t have enough on the shelf in the first half. We do anticipate that we will have more availability on the shelf in the second half of this year. And then there is the input cost themselves. As you probably noticed, we did have higher cost of goods in the quarter relative to last year of about 50 basis points. That\u2019s really across the board. So some of the raw materials that go into our product, they are certainly at a higher cost due to limited availability. There is some higher wage pressures, as you\u2019ve noted. I would say that\u2019s less within the world of Johnson & Johnson and our manufacturing entities and more around the third-party manufacturers that we contract with. But I would say those have stabilized. We did have a healthy assumption around inflation coming into the year. We think that has increased as we\u2019ve progressed through these first 6 months by about 40%. So, some of that will play into next year\u2019s thinking as well. As you know, the accounting is such where what we\u2019re building today, some of that gets relieved to the P&L early next year. But we think we\u2019re able to manage it, as you saw in our results, able to slightly beat. And we\u2019re being much more selective in terms of our resource deployment. We\u2019ve raised the bar on our selectivity of where we invest, but we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we were able to increase what we believe our future depends upon, and that\u2019s innovation by a 9% increase in R&D. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Can I just get latest thoughts on business development for both Pharma and MedTech? I guess specifically, you\u2019re seeing additional opportunities in the Pharma business with biotech valuations now having been depressed for, I guess, three or four quarters. And then on the MedTech business, I know this is a priority, Joaquin. Can you just talk about the landscape you\u2019re seeing as the company continues to engage on potential opportunities there? And then just a final one, just maybe following up on the last comment, for operating margins, I know they are flat this year due to inflation. Can we think about the company resuming operating margin expansion in 2023 or does some of these inflationary pressures you\u2019re seeing still need to annualize, and it\u2019s not as clear of what the directional trend for \u201823 will be at this point? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Chris. And let me start with the M&A question first, and then Joe will address the operating margin question. So M&A has always been an important component of Johnson & Johnson innovation, as I was talking in the past 5 years, we executed about 40 acquisitions, some major licensing agreements, investing over $16 billion. And specifically in our Pharmaceutical business, about half of our innovation, it\u2019s coming sourced externally. So when we look at M&A, we took \u2013 we take a strategic approach. The first thing we try to look at is what is the improvement in the standard of care that we are looking in that particular opportunity and to what extent it enables us to get into higher growth markets. And we are agnostic about which sector. So we try to look at those opportunities in the context of the improvement in standard of care, entering to higher-growth markets and delivering a fair financial return. So as we look at the opportunities today in the market, we are not opportunistic about it, and we are still looking always at the fundamentals of these companies. And obviously, there are different opportunities in the market that are interesting and can complement our existing franchises or built into adjacencies. When it comes to MedTech, the focus continues to be strengthening our current strongholds and also accessing some high-growth market segments to accelerate growth. And the target areas are the ones that we are operating today : high health orthopedics, cardiology, surgery, Historically, it\u2019s been a predictor of our success to the extent we were closer to the areas that we have capabilities. When it comes to pharmaceuticals, we are looking at our key therapeutic areas : immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension and also cardiovascular and metabolics. So we are agnostic, as you know, at the source of innovation, and we use multiple modalities to onboard innovation from acquisitions to equity investments to strategic collaborations. So down the road, we continue to see M&A as an important source of building our pipeline and also fortifying our current portfolio and we are now in a position that, for the first time, right, Joe, in the last 5 years, we\u2019re in a cash-neutral position. And we continue to look at the opportunities that are out there, and we will continue to do it. Joe Wolk : Yes, well said. Chris thanks for the question regarding operating margins. I don\u2019t want to get too far out in front of my SKUs with respect to projecting next year at this point, but maybe some considerations that you should have in mind. We always look to streamline our business, where possible, look for inefficiencies and either let that fall to the bottom line or preferably put that into R&D. So as we close out the second half of the year, I\u2019d like to see how our pipeline is progressing. If some of that\u2019s accelerated, that\u2019s going to be reason for additional investment. I do think these inflationary pressures will be here to stay. I don\u2019t see a lot of decreases on the near-term horizon. I\u2019d also ask you not to lose sight of the fact that we are separating out our Consumer Health business, and we are taking that opportunity to look at, I would say, how we support our business, the infrastructure that\u2019s involved with a two-segment company versus the historical three-segment company we have. I\u2019d like to see a little bit more of the separation time line play out before we commit to any of those efficiencies that may be gained there and exactly when the timing of those may be incurred, whether that\u2019s the first half or second half of 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts. The first part, I want to just spend some time on hospital volumes, what you are seeing in terms of elective surgeries throughout the summer and then into the back half of the year. And then I will toss the second question on now to you. You talked about targeted price increases. How do you think about \u201cthe target\u201d and how well are they being accepted? And I am thinking not just in \u2013 across the board, but almost specifically in MedTech. Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Joe, do you want to start with the targeted price increases and I go then to the volumes. Joe Wolk : Sure. Yes. So, the targeted price increases we referred to, Joanne, and thanks for the question. In consumer, that\u2019s kind of keeping consistent with the peer set to offset the inflationary pressures. We do know that while folks are looking to more generally cut back spending that\u2019s been in entertainment, dining out, when it comes healthcare, better health, looking better, products like AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, Tylenol, Listerine, they seem to do really well, and consumers will prioritize those. With specifically to MedTech, as you probably appreciate, a lot of our portfolio is really governed by contracts that are already in place with hospital systems. So, it\u2019s difficult unless there is certain inflationary clauses within those contracts. That\u2019s what we mean when we say targeted. It\u2019s very selective and I would say it\u2019s probably not the majority of the hospital volumes or hospital contracting that you may say. Joaquin, you want to talk about volumes? Joaquin Duato : When it comes to hospital volumes and the trajectory of MedTech in general, right. Overall, our MedTech business delivered 6% competitive growth in the first half of 2022 and delivered just over 1% sequential operational growth Q2 versus Q1. So, that is in the middle of the market headwinds due to mobility restrictions inflation and supply challenges. So, a very resilient performance of our J&J MedTech business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and competitive, and we continue to see market share positive trajectory in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms in which we are maintaining or gaining share in the most recent period of Q1 2022. And we see also good progression in our pipeline and new products launched. Overall, for the market, when we are talking about the market specifically, we saw improvements in procedure volume in North America, in EMEA and in Lat-Am. That remain above pre-COVID levels through the quarter. So, that was the positive side. On the other hand, we saw the impact of regional mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Moving forward, we estimate that we will have a continuous improvement in the second half of the year due to continued market recovery and also our own competitive momentum while, at the same time, we are going to continue to monitor the COVID-19 dynamics and the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, I wanted to ask you about milvexian and Factor XIa inhibitors and what you see the market opportunity to be. Also, what data will you be presenting at ESC this year? And then can you give any color on indications you will be pursuing in your Phase 3 studies? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question. And milvexian, it\u2019s an important component of our pipeline. As a matter of fact, when we met with you in November, milvexian was one of the five medicines that we estimated we are going to continue peak sales of about $5 billion. That was together with CARVYKTI, milvexian, nipocalimab, amivantamab plus lazertinib and our Auris platform. So, those were the five medicines that we are going to contributing \u2013 to contribute more than $5 billion. And clearly, milvexian, it\u2019s an important one in that context. We are developing milvexian, as you know, in collaboration with BMS, and we see this as an important opportunity to improve the standard of care in the current indications for oral anticoagulants, which are very large. And they are easily to be estimated because you know where they are used today, but also the potential to expand into areas in which today, oral anticoagulants are not used to bleeding concerns. So, we see a very significant market opportunity for milvexian as an improvement of this category versus the Factor Xa. So, there are two Phase 2 studies that are assessing the potential of milvexian to reduce their risk of cardiovascular events. One is the one of total knee replacement. Data on that one was presented earlier in 2021. And the second one, which I guess is the one you are referring to, is the one in secondary stroke prevention, which we want to determine whether the addition of milvexian through aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than standard anti-plated [ph] therapy in secondary stroke prevention. The data, as you know, is already in-house, and we expect to present it in a medical meeting in 2022. Specifically, I think it\u2019s at the end of August in a European cardiology meeting. And at that point, we shall see. But for us, if the data pans out, obviously, milvexian could have a very significant market opportunity that goes beyond the existing Factor Xa plus. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had just two on the medical devices franchise. And the first is, it\u2019s just on the volume recovery. I think as we listen to hospital executives and insurers talk about the volume recovery, we consistently hear about this not getting back to pre-pandemic levels even as we sit in the first half of 2022. I just wanted to, kind of sanity check and, Joe, see, and Joaquin, if there is any kind of metrics you can give us in terms of where J&J\u2019s volumes sit relative to 2019? While it\u2019s not the most appropriate comp here as we are a couple of years out from 2019, but wanted to just get your views on where the disconnect is in terms of the revenue growth that we are seeing from your businesses off of 2019 versus volume growth. And why we are hearing some of this the commentary that we are not back to pre-pandemic volumes yet? And then the second question, I guess is for Joaquin and just thinking about your strategy and to accelerate momentum in the MedTech business had a nice start to 2022. But wanted to kind of get a better understanding of, I guess the plan and the roadmap in terms of the number of quarters, years that you envision assessing success and hitting your internal targets? Is this a 2-year to 3-year plan, or could you see acute strategic, new strategies implemented if you are not seeing the momentum that you expect to see over the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months? Thanks for taking both questions. Joe Wolk : Hi Josh, this is Joe. Let me try to answer the first part of that question, and then I will turn it over to Joaquin for the second part, the first part being around volume recovery. To your point, and it\u2019s something that we struggle with internally, it\u2019s really still clunky when it comes to comparative analysis versus prior periods. So, we do look back at 2019, I can tell you our operational sales growth for MedTech over the first six months is about 10% overall. I would say half of that is \u2013 maybe two-thirds is really attributable to just a great job that Ashley and her team have been doing with launching new products and better execution. So, our cadence of innovation has improved. We have got a lot of new offerings across really all four of those major franchises and we are picking up market share because of that. And then I would say probably the rest is procedure volume. Again, it gets really difficult to really draw comparisons around procedure volume because we still are dealing with the impact of COVID in the second quarter alone in China. That impacted growth and procedures were down roughly 25% with a little bit improvement towards the last month from what we saw in April and May. So, we continue to look at that as well. But I would say the improvement in MedTech is really come from the stated goals that you heard a couple of years ago from Ashley and team, and that\u2019s a better cadence of innovation. I think we are going to \u2013 we had 10 new products launched in the first half of this year. Roughly the same amount is relied upon in the second half and then again, attracting market share with better effectiveness through our sales force and commercial efforts. Joaquin Duato : Yes. Thank you, Josh, and thank you for the question on MedTech because it gives me an opportunity to talk more about the performance of the MedTech business. And a couple of aspects there. One is the current performance and then how we are improving our market share and commercial execution and also our new product introduction and our pipeline progression. So, in the first half of the year, I just commented that our group has a competitive growth of 6%. It\u2019s also underlying by our growth in the first quarter of 8.6%. We will see how the rest of the sector performs in this quarter, but our growth in the first half of the year was a competitive growth with 6%. So, in that sense, my view is that we are already getting competitive growth rates in MedTech with 6% in the first half of the year. The growth rate in the second quarter has to be also put into perspective in the fact that the comparison with the second quarter of 2021 is a difficult one. MedTech grew 59% in the second quarter of 2021. And also there was some impact of the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. So, we are improving our commercial execution and improving our pipeline. In the commercial execution, the data that we have from the first quarter shows that we are maintaining or gaining share in 10 of our 11 largest platforms. So, that\u2019s a good indication that the recovery is in play. And on the new product pipeline, there is many exciting new developments that we are getting to market, starting with the fact that our MONARCH robotic platform has received 510 clearance for urology indications, which are going to open a new market for us in kidney stones. We have now enrolled the first patient in our electrophysiology pulse field ablation study, which is going to give us another innovation in our very successful electrophysiology business. We just launched our new Stapler ECHELON 3000, which is a digitally enabled device that comes also with significant evidence on how it improves patient outcomes in the cerebrovascular franchise. We just launched EMBOGUARD Balloon Catheter, which is designed to optimize the removal of blood clots in ischemic stroke and reducing time. So, there is a number of positive developments that are enhancing our ability to launch new products there. So, we feel optimistic about the combination of executing on our commercial priorities and at the same time, continue the good cadence of new product innovation that, that is going to take us to competitive growth as demonstrated by our 6% growth in the first half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Good morning and thank you. A two-part question on the U.S. immunology market in general, and TREMFYA specifically. Across the category, what\u2019s your view on the outlook for how the balance of the year will progress in the immunology category based upon what you are seeing in terms of patient volume trends year-to-date? And then specifically on TREMFYA, the performance and outlook there, you highlighted some share gains in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Where are these gains coming from? Can you help us understand competitive dynamics versus other biologics? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. Great question, Chris. Overall, we see a recovery in the immunology market with new patient levels already exceeding pre-COVID levels. So, we are optimistic about the recovery, specifically utilizing the metric of new patients. So, that\u2019s progressing well for the immunology market. When it comes to TREMFYA, it continues to deliver strong growth worldwide, with net trade sales growing in the quarter about 30%, despite of headwind of a prior period adjustment that has reduced about 750 basis points. So, a strong performance of TREMFYA. When it comes to share, I think it was commented that we capture about 2.5 points incremental in psoriasis and about a larger amount in psoriatic arthritis, where we are already the market share leader. It was three points in psoriatic arthritis. It\u2019s difficult to tell you where this is coming from. I mean we are assuming that this is going to be coming from older therapies that are there in the market, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. But clearly, TREMFYA is doing really well, both in psoriasis and in psoriatic arthritis. And psoriatic arthritis is the market-leading in new-to-brand share. We are also pleased with the fact that we have published recently first and best-in-class 5-year durability data, and also that we have been able to be the only IL-23 therapy to demonstrate inhibition of structural damage in PSA. So, we are very positive about the trajectory of TREMFYA, which is a reflection of the strength of our immunology franchise. Continuing with the future of TREMFYA, which I think it\u2019s important for you to consider, we are now fully enrolled in our trial in ulcerative colitis, and we are nearing fully enrollment completion in our trial in Crohn\u2019s disease. So, that predicates well for the growth of TREMFYA moving forward. Addition to that \u2013 in addition to that, we presented very encouraging and interesting data in IBD in combination of TREMFYA with SIMPONI, so guselkumab that show best-in-class results and best-in-class data, and we are very pleased with that. And also, if you look at our pipeline, we are also continuing to progress into Phase 2 with our own oral IL-23. So, very strong future of TREMFYA, one of the key products in our growth moving forward, a very strong future for our franchise in immunology. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Chris. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Your line is now live. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So, congrats on the results and the updates. My question is about proposed drug pricing legislation, which is concerning given its potential impact on innovation and the State of New Jersey where you are headquartered. So, could you please comment on how the legislation would negatively impact incentives to pursue transformational new medicines for seniors and what J&J is doing to educate senators in New Jersey and beyond? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question and a great question. First, it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on the content of the legislation or the feasibility of that legislation passing. There has been a lot of ups and downs there. While we are very closely following the dynamics, the situation is still fluid. So, it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on the actual legislation or in the feasibility. Now, if we believe that the legislation is going to base on the language that we know from the Senate Finance Committee, as you pointed out, that will have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of the industry, of the companies to be able to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Just for perspective, the biopharmaceutical industry invested about $120 billion in R&D in 2020. Johnson & Johnson, ourselves, in our pharmaceutical business, we invested $12 billion in R&D in 2021. So, as a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect in innovation that will be translated in less new medicines for patients. Again, for perspective, since 2000, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced about 1,000 new medicines. The impact that this will have may affect the advances that we have in multiple areas that are still needed to be able to advance patient care. So, it\u2019s a very seamless situation that will affect innovation, will affect our ability to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Now, we are also engaging with different stakeholders in trying to educate them about the impact of this type of legislation and innovation. But at the same time, we also want to sit at the table and participate in discussions to address what we believe is the major issue, which is patient affordability and patient access, specifically in Part D. So, we think that, that\u2019s something that the industry has to address with the relevant stakeholders, and we are very willing to sit at the table and shoulder the consequences of being able to address the patient affordability issue. Now, I always have \u2013 I always need to remember to you that in a price-constrained environment, Johnson & Johnson performs relatively better than most of our peers and competitors based on a number of factors. First, our diversification. Second, we have about half of our sales that come outside of the U.S. And third, specifically in the pharmaceutical business, we have been able to deliver above-market growth in the face of mid-single digit niche price decreases. So, we know how to grow in a difficult pricing environment. As a matter of fact, all of our growth comes from volume. So, if you are thinking about where to be in these circumstances, Johnson & Johnson really, it\u2019s a good place based on its diversification and our ability to drive growth through volume. Jessica Moore : Wonderful. Thank you, David, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, everybody, for participating in the call. Again, very pleased with the solid results achieved by our teams year-to-date. It shows the quality and the market leadership of our franchises and the great execution of our company in the middle of these challenges. We are also making good progress in the three strategic priorities that I outlined at the outset of this call regarding the consumer separation and the creation of the new Johnson & Johnson, our ability to continue to grow in our pharmaceutical business through the STELARA patent expiration and our continued recovery and competitive growth and MedTech. As we conclude today, also a quick reminder on our recent ESG investor update, which highlighted progress against our 2025 Health for Humanity goals. I encourage all of you to listen to the webcast replay on our website if you didn\u2019t have a chance to do it already. We look forward to connecting with all of you again and keeping you updated on our continuous progress on future earnings calls. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our webcast and teleconference today. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Unidentified Company Representative : Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events, using the information available as of today's date, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These clients acknowledge those relationships. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. In addition to today's presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today's call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules. I will now review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.8 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8.1% as currency had a negative impact of 6.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 4.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 0.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.3%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 12.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.2% worldwide, 4.2% in the U.S., and 12.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.68 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55, representing decreases of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.8%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2021, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Continuing with the streamlined remarks shared in the prior two quarters, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 0.4%, with an increase of 2.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.7%. And outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 4.8%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season; and OUS growth in NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to market growth and new product launches. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the U.S. and suspension of sales of personal care products in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion increased 2.6%, with growth of 3% in the U.S. and 2% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 9%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 16.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 9.2%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.9%; U.S. operational sales growth increased to 7%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 11.3%. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA as well as our paliperidone long-acting portfolio and was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 38.7% and 51.2%, respectively. IMBRUVICA sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competitive pressures. In the U.S., the CLL market remains below pre-COVID levels, while in the EU results were negatively impacted by government clawbacks. Overall, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our Immunology business, TREMFYA grew 41.9%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 3.2 points and 1.7 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. STELARA growth of 8% was driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 5.2 points and 6.9 points in the U.S., respectively. Results in the quarter were partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 600 basis points on worldwide growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion increased by 2.1%, with growth of 7.7% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.1%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 8.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.1%. Drivers for growth across MedTech include procedure recovery as well as focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products such as ENSEAL X1 devices in energy; VELYS digital solutions across our orthopedic platforms; and additional solutions, enhancing our industry-leading electrophysiology portfolio. Based on our most recent share data, we continue to enhance or sustain market share positions in the large majority of our 11 priority platforms. As a reminder, these 11 platforms each generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter is the impact of volume based procurement in China and timing of international tenders, primarily in orthopedics and supply challenges, primarily in surgical vision. Aligned with our previously communicated expectations, MedTech operational sales grew sequentially versus the prior quarter. And for additional context, selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 170 basis points, primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact in the pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies in the MedTech and the Consumer Health businesses. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.1% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 5% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business and increased investment across multiple franchises in the MedTech business. The other income and expense line was an expense of approximately $500 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, partially offset by losses on securities, Consumer Health separation related costs and COVID-19 vaccine related costs in the current quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.4% versus 4.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2022 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the company's Consumer Health business due to the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries, a one-time special item in Q3 2021 that reduced taxable income in the quarter and unfavorable income mix. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16% versus 13.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 34.5% to 33.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and commodity inflation impact on cost of products sold. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 43.8% to 41.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins remained flat at 25.5%. Commodity inflation and increased investment in research and development were offset by supply chain efficiencies in sales, marketing and administrative leveraging. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 24.2% to 24.3%, despite inflationary pressures, driven by price actions and investment prioritization. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. As Jess just shared, we are pleased to report solid results across our business segments in the third quarter. We accelerated operational sales growth across all three segments, and we're able to meet earnings expectations despite significant inflationary impacts to input costs. This performance reflects the strength of our business and versatility of our operations despite persistent global macroeconomic challenges. Given Johnson & Johnson's 136-year history, we are no stranger to periods of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, but we have a proven track record of navigating through periods of challenge and volatility. With a diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet, we've repeatedly demonstrated our ability to deliver results in the short-term while executing against our long-term strategy, focused on improving health outcomes and access to care. Let me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter. We continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand. We continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area. I had the pleasure of being at the opening for this campus. Seeing it in person only reinforces for me that the combination of science, technology and data analytics will be the future of medicine. We also made further progress in the separation of Kenvue, the name of the planned new Consumer Health company. In addition to announcing the name, brand, visual identity and purpose, Larry Merlo was named as the Non-Executive Chair Designate. Congratulations, Larry. Thibaut, Ashley and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. Investing in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through three quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year. In addition to investing in organic growth opportunities, our team continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and other external collaborations that would enhance our current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets, while delivering strong financial returns. In mid-September, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase of up to $5 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock. This program underscores our confidence in the business and our pipeline, while also delivering returns for our shareholders. This program, combined with our dividends, has yielded nearly $11 billion being returned to shareholders already in 2022. Moving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter, operational sales growth across all three businesses, healthcare as well as our business continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals, despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening US dollar relative to other currencies. And as seen on this slide, inflation in the US remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the US. You saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoints and tightening the ranges. On sales, we are narrowing our base business operational sales range to $97.5 billion to $98 billion or a growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. While this full year operational sales guidance is an acceleration to our year-to-date growth, it does imply a slight deceleration when comparing to the third quarter growth, driven by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in EMEA and during the month of September. We don't speculate on currency impacts. However, using the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 0.97, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 490 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 1.8% to 2.3% compared to 2021 or $93 billion to $93.5 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L. While we were able to absorb some of the inflationary pressures this year, we are lowering our full year operating margin projection due to the impacts of inflation across most spend categories to a decline of approximately 50 basis points. Given year-to-date trends on favorable employee benefit-related items, we are increasing our other income estimates to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Regarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million, of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% and to 15.5%. Considering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result, and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05. I appreciate that, many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models. We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our pharmaceutical business every year towards our goal of $60 billion in Pharmaceutical sales by 2025, despite the STELARA LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the US. For MedTech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from volume-based pricing in China. For Consumer Health, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases, and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023. We expect inflationary pressures and higher input costs to persist, and we are continuing to take actions to offset these challenges. While some inflationary pressures are improving, keep in mind that, certain products we manufacture in 2022 will be sold and flow through our P&L in 2023. As far as standing up Kenvue as an independent company, we expect to announce further details on the type of separation, as well as stand-up cost estimates, and how we are addressing stranded costs later this year or early in 2023. We remain on track to complete the separation in mid to late 2023 as indicated in the initial announcement we made in November of 2021. Finally, as previously mentioned, we don't speculate on currency movement, but utilizing the euro spot rate of last week, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact on 2023's adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.45 or $0.10 more than the $0.30 to $0.35 impact I referenced in July's call. 2022 has proven to be an active and unpredictable year, yet Johnson & Johnson continues to reliably meet the needs of patients while navigating the volatile global economic and operating environment. The executive committee could not be prouder of our team members across the globe for their commitment to excellence. We are continuously inspired by their dedication and unwavering focus on delivering growth for our stakeholders while staying true to our credo. I am now pleased to welcome our worldwide chairs, starting with Thibaut for Consumer Health, soon to be officially Kenvue. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Joe and good morning to all of you. We are indeed very proud of the achievements we have completed so far in 2022. As we shared with you throughout the year, we told you that Consumer Health would deliver improved performance starting in the second half of the year and that is exactly what you saw with our good performance in the third quarter. Our strategy is working. Our pricing actions were realized, supply chain constraints eased, and we are also against easier prior year comparables. Our third quarter results reflect those dynamics and really demonstrate our ability to achieve results despite the macroeconomic environment that Joe referenced, and that continues to be volatile. And all of this, thanks to the strength of our brands and the quality of our teams. So, looking towards 2023 and in line with our results to-date, we do anticipate that the strength and resilience of our well-balanced portfolio, together with the consumer loyalty to our brands, will continue to position our business to perform competitively with the market. Now, regarding our future, as you just heard from Joe, we are making great strides towards the planned separation of the Consumer Health business, including our recent announcement of our new name, Kenvue. So, as you can imagine, a lot of thought and care was taken to ensure that the name was memorable, distinctive, easy to pronounce in multiple languages. We then applied our expert brand-building skills to create a brand identity that reflects our new name, but also leave space for iconic brands that touch the lives of more than a billion people around the world every day. Every element was chosen to truly represent us as a future stand-alone company with the core attributes demonstrating an association with trust, care, science, and positioning Kenvue as a modern digital-first company. We also unveiled our purpose this quarter, which is realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. And in these seven words, we reflect our heritage of caring, but also play back what the world expects of us and the role we need to fulfill in society. We indeed believe that daily self-care rituals add up over time and have a profound cumulative impact on well-being. And our work at Kenvue will be to put that power into the hands of consumers around the world. So, we're excited for the journey ahead. Now, with Larry Merlo, named as our designated nonexecutive Chair, and our teams are all focused on continuing to deliver results, while progressing towards realizing the full potential of Kenvue. And now let me hand over to Ashley. Ashley McEvoy : Thank you, Thibaut. Well, good morning. So, last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with four new products -- first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness. So in quarter three, we launched our next-generation TECNIS Symfony OptiBlue. It's our latest presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens; our ACUVUE OASYS MAX contact lens; the HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter; and the OCTARAY Mapping Catheter. So to just have a quick refresh on ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX. All of us know, we live digitally intense lives, and this lens was custom designed to really meet those digitally intensive lifestyles. It builds upon our industry-leading portfolio. OASYS is ranked number one. It's the largest brand in the category, and it's unbeaten in comfort across 31 clinical trials. Moving over to our Biosense Webster business. We have a launch of our HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter. This catheter is unique. It's a one-shop balloon technology, and it enables PV isolation in 12 seconds with customized energy delivery and our one integrated 3D mapping solution. So we are already seeing the impact HELIOSTAR has resulted in an 86% freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia at 12 months. So this is our entry into the single-shot ablation. Really just a couple of the ways that our team is delivering differentiated solutions really through a focus on breakthrough science and a consistent focus on doctors' critical needs. So I'm very encouraged by the strong innovation to-date and even more excited about the potential of our pipeline to come. And when I start to think about 2023, we are very focused on our mission to make the future of health care smarter, less invasive and more personalized. You've heard me consistently say this is how we can show up in health care. We will continue, particularly in today's times, a little bit of uncertain times to prioritize programs that are strengthening our core, that are really getting us on the forefront of shaping the new frontiers and medical intervention and a consistent drumbeat of always improving our competitiveness. We know that health care has an unbelievable amount of humility, but also amazing purpose. And as Joe has mentioned, we are -- it's very clearly in a dynamic time. We're going to continue to manage through the macroeconomic factors like hospital staffing, like inflation, like supply constraints and some of the overhang of the pandemic. But we are encouraged with procedural volumes in many parts of the world. They're recovering quite nicely. Some parts of the world are still a little bit below pre-COVID levels, but we are confident in the resiliency and agility of the MedTech industry and our anticipated continued recovery across the world. So thank you, and I'm pleased to turn it over to Jennifer. Jennifer Taubert : Thank you, Ashley, and hello, everyone. Good morning. I'd really like to start off by thanking my pharmaceutical colleagues for another strong quarter with operational growth of 9%. That was broadly based across our portfolio and our regions. As Jess noted, we continue to maximize the value of our diverse leading portfolio, delivering above-market growth with a number of key drivers : DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA, also UPTRAVI, XARELTO and our long-acting paliperidone portfolio. So, really great performance across the portfolio and throughout the globe. In addition to our strong performance, the Pharmaceutical business achieved some important milestones during the quarter, both in terms of approvals and new data readouts. So first, we're really pleased to announce our first approval globally for TECVAYLI. This is our first-in-class off the shelf bispecific antibody for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and this approval was from the European Commission. And we are on track to receive approval from the US FDA before year-end. TECVAYLI is a really important addition to our multiple myeloma portfolio, particularly for this difficult to treat patient population. Also in multiple myeloma, the final analysis from our Phase 2 GRIFFIN study of a DARZALEX based investigational quadruplet regimen was presented, really highlighting the potential benefit of adding DARZALEX to this front-light treatment regimen in multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. Separately, we received two approvals for IMBRUVICA. So European Commission approved an all-oral fixed duration treatment combination with venetoclax in frontline CLL. And the US FDA granted approval for pediatric patients with chronic graft versus host disease, marking the first pediatric approval for IMBRUVICA and making IMBRUVICA the only BTKi with 12 FDA approvals across seven indications. If we turn to solid tumors, data from our early-stage trials from our combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib were presented at WCLC. Importantly, these data demonstrated a benefit in frontline treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to data from our Phase 3 MARIPOSA study in the future. And last, in immunology, we presented new data for TREMFYA from the Phase 3b GUIDE study, which demonstrated even higher rates of complete skin clearance in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were started earlier in the course of their disease. So it bodes well for earlier treatment for TREMFYA and continued growth. As I said, I'm really proud of our pharmaceuticals team and what we accomplished in the third quarter, and I look forward to finishing the year strong. As we look ahead, with our focus on transformational medical innovation, our pipeline of current medicines, our robust pipeline of new medicines and world-class capabilities, we remain really confident in our growth expectations. The ones that we outlined at our pharmaceutical business review last November, including the fact that we expect to be a $60 billion pharmaceutical company by 2025. So thank you very much. And Jess, I'll turn it back over to you. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Jennifer, Thibaut and Ashley. This concludes the prepared remarks portion of our earnings call. Kevin, could you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just a couple of -- just a two-parter for Joe. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on 2023 operating margin dynamics? It seems like you're seeing some modest operating margin erosion this year due to inflation. Should we be thinking about a similar step down in 2023, or is there a better ability to manage some of these inflation pressures as I guess some of these start to ease as you go through the year? And maybe a second question, just as we think about 2023, just tying some of the segment comments together, and as we think about top line, is there any reason to assume a meaningful deviation from the operational growth trends that you're seeing in 2022 as we look out to 2023? And I guess maybe specifically in that, is the STELARA LOE, a large enough of a headwind next year that we need to start to think about that impacting growth, or is that more like a 2024 and beyond issue? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Good morning Chris. Thanks for your questions. What I'll do is I'll give you some insights around 2023 op margin. And then maybe I think it might be productive to turn it over to each of the segment heads to talk about what their outlook is for 2023 in a qualitative way at this point. So for 2023 op margins, I think you have a couple of dynamics that we're facing. Clearly, the macroeconomic pressures that all industries and all companies are facing is something that we have to address as well. While healthcare is a very, very good business and more resilient than most, it's not as if we're immune to some of those dynamics. So as we finalize our plans for 2023, we will be looking at prioritizing our resource deployment to those initiatives, those projects, those services that deliver the most value for patients, which in turn is then healthy for our business. The other dynamic that's at play, Chris, and maybe why I'm a little bit hesitant to give you specific guidance at this point in time, is the separation of the Consumer Health business, so we're going through some of our plans now. We have the opportunity, as we said on prior calls, to rightsize our infrastructure for a two-segment company versus a three-segment company that we've had historically. And so we're looking at opportunities there as well. I think given the pressures from both of those fronts, we take it as our responsibility here at Johnson & Johnson's management to ensure that we mitigate those, we prioritize every dollar that we have that goes to securing our long-term future, specifically in innovation and R&D. And that's where we'll continue to focus. We know that, that has a proven track record of success when we do that, specifically when we focus on those precious few projects that matter the most. And that's what we'll continue to do in 2023. So more to come on op margins, but we will -- we're not oblivious, obviously, to the world around us, and we're going to manage those very, very effectively. Why don't I turn it over to Jennifer to maybe give an outlook on Pharmaceuticals and specifically address the impact for STELARA next year. Jennifer Taubert : Hi, Chris. Good morning. So for 2023, we anticipate another year of above-market growth for the Pharmaceuticals group. These results, we anticipate to be driven by continued growth of our key brands like DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA, SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI. And this really coming from a combination of increased penetration as well as continued market share gains. And then we also continue -- or expect continued uptake of our new launches. So products like CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI that I just mentioned, products like Spravato, et cetera. And so while we do anticipate STELARA LOE really in that late September time frame or towards the end of the year, we believe that we've got a lot of tailwinds with our existing portfolio and our new launches to continue to have another year of above-market growth in 2023. Joe Wolk : Thibaut, you may want to say a few words on consumers' outlook? Thibaut Mongon : Yes, absolutely. 2023, we expect that the world will continue to be extremely volatile, inflationary pressure, supply chain disruption, geopolitical environment and continued impact from COVID pandemic in certain parts of the world. So we -- with that in mind, we are certainly prepared to navigate this environment, thanks to the quality of our brands, the strengthening of our execution capabilities around the world. And as you referenced to innovation, we continue to play a big part in our results. Moving forward, we see that the innovation we bring to market this year are extremely well received by consumers around the world, and we expect this to continue in 2023. Joe Wolk : Ashley? Ashley McEvoy : No, I would just say, consistent really building on the momentum in 2022. So for the first three quarters of the year, we're looking at near 7% growth. And so, our eyes around keeping that momentum from a demand generation on revenue next year and having a revenue number that beats the market. Clearly, in today's environment, the cost of doing business has gone up. And so, we are doing everything we can to manage and mitigate that to remain competitive from -- typically, we have one or two points of price erosion. We've actually been commanding price/mix realization in today's environment through supply chain efficiencies, admin efficiencies and some price/mix realization. We do see some of the downsides in China from VBP that we're weathering through those and earning some of those tenders going forward. But we'd like to very much keep the investment going in R&D because, as you can see in the past couple of years, it's really benefited from accelerating our growth curve. Joe Wolk : So, Chris, hopefully, that answers your question. But I think what you should take away is, clearly, the breadth of our portfolio, the reach of our geographic presence positions us very, very well. While STELARA is certainly a big product. I think its Johnson & Johnson's largest product ever, we're not dependent on one product alone. And so the breadth of the portfolio that exists today as well as that, which is on the come, I think, bodes extremely well for continued growth that investors have come to expect. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter here. I have one for Ashley, one for Joe. Just Ashley, I'd love to hear your thoughts just on the macro trends impacting MedTech, a little bit more color on what you're seeing in China, some of the supply constraints and staffing shortages and how you see those playing out in Q4 and 2023? And, Joe, you've been talking about taking bolder steps in M&A. Why haven't we seen more M&A from J&J so far in 2022? And has anything changed with regard to your priorities? Thank you. Ashley McEvoy : Sure. Thank you, Larry. So I have to, first, by giving a shout-out to the MedTech team, it was a really strong quarter of 8% and 7% year-to-date. And they just have really maniacal focus is what I would say on competitiveness and customer centricity. When we -- and Joe alluded to this, Larry, if you look at -- I'll go around the world a little bit. We are seeing procedures recovering. I think we're benefiting that, posting very strong September, but also a quarter-end of 8%. In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up predominantly it did at the latter part of the quarter. We do see diagnostic procedures more in the mid-single digits, so colonoscopies as an example in quarter three. So we're expecting that to continue. Now, you'll recall that we're anniversarying Omnicron hitting kind of in the thanksgiving time frame in December, so that should be a healthy comp, but we also expect in a very focused micro surgeons in the winter surge. Europe is recovering nicely. August was a little bit of a slowdown given the holiday season, but really September picked up. Asia is in fast recovery, I would say, in India and Japan. And China is still on quarter three, recovered nicely versus quarter two, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. So we expect that bolus to continue. We are moving forward. We have a strong position in China. We have a very diversified position in China. We are moving through some of the VBP actions. That's what you saw in our Joints business, we were actually up 10% in our knees and our hips in the United States, but we had negative growth in the quarter, really due to the volume-based procurement wins on pricing actions that we'll come through that for next year. So thank you for the question, Larry. Joe Wolk : Yes, Larry, regarding M&A. Well, first of all, let me start with just reiterating the strong free cash flow that we have year-to-date, over $13 billion, also very proud of the fact that we've been able to distribute nearly a $11 billion to shareholders through the form of our dividend program, as well as the repurchase program that was announced just mid last month. So we feel really good on that front. But as you likely noticed in today's comments, we still hold $34 billion of cash, which positions us extremely well to continue exercising that level of capital allocation around acquisitions or significant collaborations going forward. So our priorities have not changed. In fact, maybe we're even a little bit more bullish and eager to do something. But as folks come to know us, we're not going to do anything haphazardly. We're not \u2013 the aspect of this company that is really enjoyable as being the CFO is we don't have to do anything out of desperation. We're going to find those assets that have a great strategic fit, and then make sense from a financial perspective with respect to returning to shareholders something that compensates them for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. The market is a little bit funny. The volatility actually doesn't help for a conducive M&A environment right now, because you have sellers \u2013 potential sellers holding on to 52-week highs, or all-time highs, which, quite frankly, aren't too distant in the rearview mirror. We're going to approach it with a very fundamental discounted cash flow analysis, to make sure we're bringing value forward. But the short answer to your question is our priorities have not changed. We're looking to complement the already strong portfolio you heard in the first round of responses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. So, I wanted to ask you, if you any updated thoughts on getting to that $60 billion of pharma sales by 2025. And this is all organic growth. And if it's not, where could sales go with M&A? And what areas are you seeing the best opportunities in M&A? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Hi, Louise, thanks so much for the question. So, the projections that we gave you about the $60 billion in revenue by 2025 really is all based on our current portfolio and our current pipeline, so that doesn't have anything factored in right now in terms of M&A. Anything that we did there, we would look at to be additive. When we take a look at how we're going to get there, we really believe we're going to have a compound annual growth rate of at least 5%, with growth in every year, and that includes through the STELARA LOE. We think we've got eight key brands that we'll be able to post double-digit growth through 2025. And as we take a look through our pipeline and portfolio between now and then 14 novel therapies filed with potential to exceed $1 billion, and we've got five of which we think actually have potential to exceed $5 billion, so that's products like Novavax vaccine, which is in our partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb; amivantamab and lazertinib combination, which I mentioned for non-small cell lung cancer that we've got good data coming through; nipocalimab, which is progressing really nicely through the various stages of clinical development. That's the auto antibody asset that we brought in from the Momenta acquisition. We have our TARIS platform that is progressing nicely for bladder cancer, and we have CARVYKTI. While we're still in the early stages of launching and ramping that asset, based on the strength of the data and the clinical trials remain really bullish on what CARVYKTI is going to mean for patients with multiple myeloma around the world. And so I think based on our existing assets and the continued growth, I mean if you take a look at DARZALEX and the results that we just posted quarter, 39% growth, consistent with what we've been seeing as well as growth in assets like TREMFYA, ERLEADA, et cetera. You take a look at the existing portfolio, you layer in on top of that what's coming through with the pipeline, and that's what gives us the confidence to hit that $60 billion organically. That being said, in line with Joe, we're constantly looking for ways that we can continue to augment and further build our pipeline and to do so out of a position of strength. And so predominantly, we keep our innovation engine going, bringing in things in the earlier stages, which is usually our sweet spot because we can put our R&D machinery against it as well as our terrific regulatory and commercial and market access capabilities to really build things out. But that doesn't rule out later-stage acquisitions or in-market acquisitions as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live. Joshua Jennings : All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to just ask Ashley and maybe Joe as well, just to comment on your thoughts on the resiliency of the medical device industry during a recession and in particularly, the Johnson & Johnson's medical device business and maybe parse out which device franchises could be more resilient, which could be less. And then a quick follow-up, just partly related with cardiology procedures thought to be more resilient during recession being -- most of them being life-saving. Any updated thoughts just on strategic rationale to build out your cardiology franchise and add to the Biosense Webster division? Thanks for taking the questions. Ashley McEvoy : Yes. Thank you, Josh. I mean, I think -- let me start with the macro. I think the health of the end-state markets in MedTech are quite vibrant. As we've talked, there's been bumpiness because of COVID that we're still having some of that. But there is patient demand that is still yet to be met. And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023. And you're seeing procedures that are more insulated like the cath lab is more protected in a hospital environment. Volumes have been going quite nicely. I have to give a huge shout out to the BWI team in the US, grew near 24% growth in quarter three. So -- and we're continuing to invest, to your point, in cardiology. We have a very active program in post-field ablation and we have a clinical trial in Europe that just completed in quarter two. We're looking at a 12-month readout of that on safety and efficacy and to file this year. And we're also in clinical trial in the United States for our pulse field ablation we enrolled in May 2022. We actually think the combos are going to be quite complementary of radio frequency, coupled with pulse field ablation. But -- so that's a bit about the cath lab. We're seeing bariatric procedures, which are more elective in nature, really clearing through the backlog. The ones that tend to be laggards are things like spine and we're seeing cataract surgery at a certain point becomes less selective. And the pacesetters, if you will, are areas like stroke, like trauma that are much more less elective in nature. And then I would just say from a creating patient demand, there's been a huge initiative on behalf of Johnson & Johnson and the industry to kind of move to site to care that patients are really preferring. And those areas like ambulatory surgery centers in the United States, our team predominantly in joints as well as sports, they've grown market share 20% over the past two years in those emerging channels. In areas like Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China with a population of 1.4 billion patients continue to grow and expand. So we're going to see some of those shifts that happened during the pandemic really start to, I think, pick up, where patients can get a sense of comfort and hopefully, we can kind of diffuse some of that, the scarcity of label into the right sites of care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Nice quarter. Quickly to follow-up on your comments on electrophysiology, those numbers were particularly strong. Could we pull that growth apart and discuss maybe how much of it is market growth, market share stocking maybe or possibly price? And then my big picture question has to do with Ashley's comments of dealing with, I want to get the right words here. Usually, you have one to two points of mix erosion, and you're now commanding price. I want to make sure I heard that right and then understand it a bit better. Thank you. Ashley McEvoy : Yes. No, thank you, Joanne. We always talk about BWI because it is a market leader, and yet the category still has very low penetration. Less than 12% of eligible patients are actually getting cardiac ablation. And we love this example, because we think when we think of health care, we love to kind of intercept disease before it sets in. And if you can go manage cardiac arhythmia through cardiac completion, you can really prevent a stroke. So just a huge acknowledgment of how close that team is to customers really around the world. How -- the innovation cadence, they really have many first-in-kind. And if it's not first-in-kind, their second generation will ultimately become the standard-of-care is what they've shown and just a true sense of competitiveness. So, in quarter three, BWI was up about 19%, Joanne, and as I mentioned, about 24% in the US, but 13% OUS, and very healthy growth in Europe, a very healthy growth in Asia. That is a category that, like joint, is going to go through a bit of a VBP impact in some quarters to come, but we have very differentiated innovation, and we're building kind of local on-the-ground capability to endure through those. And when I think about the state of innovation, it's just making sure that we can, from an industry penetration, take that from 12% penetration and double that. And that really is the single-minded focus of all of the innovation is to locate better lesions, deliver better lesion, make it a safer, less fluoro in the procedure, make it safer for electrophysiologists and quite frankly, scale it. There's a shortage of electrophysiologist. So we invest a lot of money on market creation. Thank you, Joanne. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for question. Just had a few pharma ones. On the I&I market, I know you guys obviously have the STELARA LOE next year. But would you expect there to be a lot of market disruption from the flood of HUMIRA biosimilars launching before? I'm just trying to think of the indirect impact on your business. And then the second question is on your cell therapy portfolio. You guys called out CARVYKTI. Any qualitative comments you have on the commercial rollout, one more quarter in? And is there an update on the CAR-T for timing that you could provide for us? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Got it. Thanks so much for the question, Jeff. So if we start off with immunology. Yes, I mean the market will be experiencing a significant event, at least in the US with some competitive biosimilars coming in against other assets. We do anticipate that that will cause a bit of disruption. But when we take a look at our business and TREMFYA, so focusing on TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I think based on what this has really the first IL-23 is delivering and delivering for patients. We can anticipate that there will still be strong continued growth for that asset. We're very, very confident in our excess positions there and being able to retain that even in the face of biosimilars to other products that are launching. Also put in a plug while we're at it. I'm talking about TREMFYA that we also feel really good about how our product TREMFYA is working through the Phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and look forward to hopefully getting that data in through the regulatory process and launching to bring even more benefit to patients with that. So we do anticipate continued growth there. And then on CARVYKTI, we're really pleased with how the product is performing for patients and the data that we're continuing to see, maybe if I start off on CARTITUDE-4 and then I'll come back on the launch. We do anticipate CARTITUDE-4 hopefully reporting by year-end. It's an event driven trial. So we have to wait until we have all of the events. But that\u2019s currently what we're planning for now, so that everyone knows CARTITUDE-4 is our study that takes a look at CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines of therapy. We're really interested and looking forward to seeing those results. So if we take a look at the early launch for CARVYKTI, we've always talked about this being really planned and thoughtful approach to scaling it. And so we're in the process right now. We've really been working closely with the centers where we had done the clinical trials to work through the initial phases. I know everyone knows about the worldwide lentivirus shortage. We've made really good progress on that and have good line of sight to that not being something that we're dependent, that not being a rate-limiting factor in the future. We're also working towards really being able to scale this at a broad level to be able to accommodate what we're seeing is both great demand for the product right now, but also what we anticipate with CARTITUDE-4, as well as hopefully with CARTITUDE-5, which would be in frontline therapy. So we reconfirm this as really a big asset with a lot of growth potential and one of our potentially $5 billion-plus brands. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Geoff. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks so much. Maybe a couple of pharma ones for me as well. I was just wondering, as you think about the combined franchise for STELARA and TREMFYA next year, can that grow versus this year? And then based on clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like the nipocalimab Phase 2 RA trial recently completed. So just wondering if you can provide any color if you're going to advance that into a Phase 3 trial for RA? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Thanks, Terry. So first question. So STELARA and TREMFYA, we're not -- we don't provide guidance by product or combinations of that. What I can say is that we do anticipate continued robust growth TREMFYA. Next year, as I indicated, TREMFYA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is really showing very strong market share gains and penetration in that market. STELARA really competes, and its strong growth has been in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And so when you take a look at those two markets, we do anticipate both of those continuing to show really good growth, at least through the first three quarters of next year with STELARA, then post September being impacted by biosimilars. And then on nipocalimab, so I don't have really to share there yet for nipocalimab. Consistent with all of our processes when we finish our studies, we go ahead and submit them to major medical meetings and get them published. I remain really confident in nipocalimab as an asset, and we've really taken a look at, at building that out across 10 or 11 different indications, including the potential for RA, which we think could be a big one. So definitely more to come on that as we can share it. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Terence, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I would now like to hand it over to Joe for some closing remarks. End of Q&A: Joe Wolk : Great. Thanks, Jess. Thank you, Thibaut, Ashley, Jennifer and Jess, for participating in today's call. And as Jess said, thanks to all of you for your time today. Hopefully, you saw with our third quarter performance, the strength of Johnson & Johnson across all of our segments and our collective ability to manage macroeconomic headwinds as well as the unfavorable impact from a stronger US dollar. We certainly take seriously our responsibility to be a reliable, strong investment in many ways for shareholders even though uncertainty may be high. Have a great day, and we look forward to our next conversation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company\u2019s review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and our financial outlook for 2023. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today\u2019s meeting may include forward-looking statements related to, among other things, the Company\u2019s future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the Company\u2019s Consumer Health business. You\u2019re cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events, using the information available as of today\u2019s date, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC\u2019s website.

This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting his first year as CEO and his priorities for 2023. I will then review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments as well as full year 2022 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close with additional business commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and our guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes. I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thanks, Jess. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business. I\u2019m excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded. And I\u2019m honored to continue this legacy. In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our Pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline. I\u2019m particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy; and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential. Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024. Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation. Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a two-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused. In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges. Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI, and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022\u2019s momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets. This will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of our new Consumer Health Company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023 as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022. Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Joaquin. Starting with Q4 2022 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9% as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points. Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.77 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%. For the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year. Net earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%. While not part of our prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4% and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season, and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health/Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced supply constraints in the U.S. COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4% with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S., operational sales declined 4.5%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA, and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA, due to loss of exclusivity along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2%, driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific. TREMFYA grew 12.5%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison. Beginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed. I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%. Q4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of value-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints predominantly in vision. Strong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1%, driven primarily by strong new product introductions performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology. Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22, the date the acquisition closed. Contact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges. In the orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. For additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis points positive impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. I\u2019d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year, driven by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year, driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year. Interest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million, driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related exit costs, higher Consumer Health separation-related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities. As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company\u2019s modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year. Additionally, the Company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I\u2019ll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let\u2019s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22%, driven by brand marketing phasing with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023. We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long-term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of Talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business. Let\u2019s delve into the financials, beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation. Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved. Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech\u2019s presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships. Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we\u2019ve completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022. I\u2019ll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments. We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance. We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don\u2019t speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year. Regarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023. The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I\u2019d like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks, starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023. In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain. Regarding quarterly phasing, it\u2019s best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements. In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half. Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health Company. On the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made. And finally, while we don\u2019t speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half. Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company. Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions. We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one, given Johnson & Johnson\u2019s market cap. In terms of dissynergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dissynergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate new Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019ll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a three-segment company to a two-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K. We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus Tagrisso as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Early clinical data from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase 3 clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Potential Phase 2 clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, potential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China, which will take effect later this year. In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics, our digital robotic solution, Ottava, our pulsed field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed. Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I am now pleased to open the line for your questions. Kevin, will you please provide the listeners with instructions if they\u2019d like to ask a question? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the time this morning. Maybe a two-part question for me. I guess, Joe, first on the guidance, you mentioned it should be viewed as responsibly cautious. Just wondering any areas you\u2019d call out in terms of conservatism as we think about the year? And then, on the pipeline side, obviously, myeloma -- sorry, excuse me, myeloma an important area for you guys. Just wondering if you can confirm the timing of the CARTITUDE-4 study and what you\u2019re hoping to see from that readout? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Good morning, Terence. I\u2019ll handle the first question, and then I\u2019ll kick the question of CARTITUDE over to Joaquin. With respect to guidance, I would say, just given all the macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, we thought this was the right approach at this point in time to come out with guidance in the ranges that we did. I wouldn\u2019t classify it as conservative per se. What I would say in terms of our outlook for the P&L, is that we\u2019re assuming a lot of carryover, quite frankly, of the inflationary impact that we had in 2022. As you can imagine, the way the accounting would work, we built inventory at higher cost in 2022. That\u2019s set on the balance sheet at year-end and will flow through mostly the first half of 2023. If there\u2019s any element of conservatism, I would say, it probably resides in the fact that we\u2019re not assuming any deflationary relief as we go throughout the year. So, we do think these costs will be at a higher level for some time. But as you saw with our fourth quarter results and really the outlook for 2023, we\u2019re doing everything we can responsibly to prioritize our top investments for the long term as well as manage costs in the interim. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. And with respect to CARTITUDE-4 and CARVYKTI, our multiple myeloma portfolio, Terence, is the most important driver of growth for our Pharmaceutical group moving forward. It\u2019s about DARZALEX continued progression in first line; CARVYKTI, our best-in-class BCMA cell therapy; the recently approved TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific; and also, we are excited about the filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. So all in all, this portfolio enables us to do something very significant, which is changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And we\u2019ll see these medicines being used in combination and in different sequences in order to achieve this treating to cure. Specifically, what you mentioned, CARTITUDE-4, which is the study that evaluates CARVYKTI in patients who have received one or three prior lines of therapy, it\u2019s very important in achieving that goal. CARTITUDE-4 is an event-driven study, and we look forward to have some results of CARTITUDE-4 in 2023. We cannot give you the specific timing because it\u2019s an event-driven study, and it will be very important in our ambition to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Your line is now live. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So, first of all, congratulations on the performance. I was hoping that you could please discuss the longer term prospects for the Pharmaceutical business. In the past, J&J has targeted $60 billion in Pharmaceutical revenue in 2025. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s still the target. And if so, what you believe consensus is under modeling because consensus is projecting sales below the $60 billion figure for 2025? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question. And turning to what you mentioned, our 2025 targets. We continue to work towards accomplishing our previously stated goals of on one hand, delivering growth every single year in our Pharmaceutical group through 2025 despite of the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, at the same time, continue to advance our differentiated pipeline and achieving $60 billion in revenue by 2025. So, we continue to work towards these goals. As we have discussed multiple times, the growth by 2025 is going to be driven mainly through the strength of our currently marketed portfolio as well as new indications of this marketed portfolio. Some examples, continuous growth of DARZALEX in first line, TREMFYA, which is gaining share, both in psoriatic arthritis and in psoriasis, and we expect a readout of our IBD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s in 2023 will provide a significant additional leg of growth for TREMFYA; ERLEADA, which is now in different indications in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer will have some readouts of studies in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2023, providing an additional leg of growth; our INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise in the U.S. as well as our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT has been affected by COVID-19, but that we expect that will continue to deliver growth. So, that is the mainstay of our growth prospects towards 2025. And I will go later about the disconnect. Then connected with that, we are also excited about our new product launches, specifically growth of SPRAVATO, growth in CARVYKTI that I just mentioned before and also TECVAYLI, which we got the approval very recently; and as I commented, the filing of Talquetamab, everything in multiple myeloma. At the same time, we continue to make significant progress in some of the key products in our pipeline. A sample of them we commented that were opportunities of more than $5 billion. Example of them, milvexian, our oral anticoagulant, the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer, our TARIS platform in bladder cancer. And finally, nipocalimab in autoantibody-mediated diseases. So, those are the key drivers of our growth moving into 2025. If I think about the main disconnect between our forecast and the Street forecast, it\u2019s our multiple myeloma portfolio. As I commented earlier, we see our multiple myeloma portfolio helping treat into cure rather than cannibalizing each other. And as a matter of fact, some of the studies that we have now in place show that ambition of combining our therapies. I mentioned CARTITUDE-4, moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy; TECVAYLI and Talquetamab, our two bispecific antibodies are being studied in combination with one another, and TECVAYLI or Talquetamab are also being a study in combination with DARZALEX. So, I see that as the major source of disconnect with the Street. Then further to that, I continue to see disconnects in SPRAVATO, our treatment for treatment-resistant depression; significant disconnects also in ERLEADA because of the indications in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer that will read in 2023. We see a disconnect, as I commented in our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT, which have been impacted by the pandemic, but we see strong growth moving forward. And then, finally, in the expectations for Xarelto loss of exclusivity, which we see that in the back half of this decade. So, those are elements that I have reflected as disconnect. So, as I said, we continue to drive towards our 2025 goal of $60 billion and posting growth every year. I think it\u2019s a reflection of the strength of our current portfolio and how well we are executing in our pipeline. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two-part one for me. Joe, can you provide a little more color on the cadence of operational sales growth in Pharma and devices? How much lower do you expect the first half to be versus the second half? And what are you assuming for market growth in each of the segments in \u201823? And Joaquin, just to follow up to David\u2019s question there on the $60 billion, it implies a 6% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. How should we think about the ramp to $60 billion? 6% do you expect it to be more back-end loaded? Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Wolk : Good morning, Larry. So, let me start by -- as you know, we don\u2019t provide guidance by quarter, but let me talk a little bit about market growth. With respect to MedTech, we anticipate pretty much what we typically see in any given year, 4% to 6%. As some of my earlier comments in the prepared remarks reflect, we anticipate that there will be a little bit of, I\u2019ll call it, carryover from some of the COVID surges that we saw in the Asia Pacific region in the fourth quarter. But, other than that, a normal cadence of steady procedure recovery. The biggest challenge that hospital administrators are facing right now is really the staffing concern, but they\u2019ve done a wonderful job in getting some sense of normalcy to that. With respect to Pharmaceuticals, again, we enjoyed our 11th consecutive year of above-market growth. We anticipate 2023 will be a 12th year, but it is off of a lower base. If you happen to see some of the IQVIA data from last week, they\u2019re calling global and actually U.S. growth somewhere in that 2.5% to 4% range, depending on what region you\u2019re looking at. So, while we will beat the market, we think it will be a lower number just by the dynamic of the market overall. And that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking of it. In terms of some of the cadence, maybe to elaborate on the comments that I had prepared earlier, we will see some of that generic erosion that we experienced in the fourth quarter in Europe with the long-acting injectables as well as ZYTIGA having a much more pronounced impact in the first and second quarter, bleeding over from the fourth quarter. And pricing measures likely will be consistent throughout the year. So hopefully, that helps give you a better sense of how we\u2019re looking at it. But again, the general theme of second half stronger than first half and probably second quarter stronger than first quarter seems to hold intact based on top line as well as bottom line performance, given our expectations. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. And regarding to your question, Larry, as we have discussed and commented, we see above market growth in 2023 for our Pharmaceutical group, which would be the 12th consecutive year of our market growth. And we continue to see positive growth in 2024 despite the loss of exclusivity in STELARA. And then we would see again pick up our growth above market in 2025. That\u2019s the sequence that we will see. Certainly, the actual growth rate will be impacted by the FX and we don\u2019t anticipate and we don\u2019t project FX. And when we were establishing our $60 billion goal, we were thinking about the FX at the moment. We don\u2019t change the $60 billion because we don\u2019t know what the FX would be by 2025. But for purposes of you understanding how we see that, we see above market growth in 2023; we see positive growth in 2024; and then, we see a pickup of growth, a significant one, in 2025 above market. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just one question and one quick clarification. I guess, on operating margins, and this is a question maybe beyond \u201823. I\u2019m just trying to think through the balance of, I guess, on one hand, some of the inflation headwinds potentially decreasing as you work through some of this inventory, I guess balanced against the STELARA LOE and some of the dissynergies from the spin. So, I guess, as something kind of bigger picture about operating margins, is 2023 a decent proxy going forward, or could we see either modest erosion in margins or expansion, or is it too early to call? I\u2019m just trying to get just some sense of how that plays out. And then my second question, which is just maybe a clarification on some of the immunology comments you made regarding 4Q. I think you mentioned unfavorable mix and rebate dynamics as headwinds. Should we expect those dynamics to continue in \u201823? And I guess, are they getting worse, or is this more just a continuation of what you\u2019ve seen in the last few years that rebates are just kind of like gradually going up for that franchise as a whole? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Great. Good morning, Chris. I\u2019ll tackle the operating margin question, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Joaquin for some of the immunology references. So with respect to operating margin, I think, while we don\u2019t give multiyear guidance, I think this year does portend to have a considerable achievement in terms of managing cost by the organization in addition to inflationary pressures. And again, that\u2019s not combated with an assumption that we\u2019ll see deflationary relief. We also have the dissynergies that come along with the consumer separation itself. As the comments indicated, we plan to address all of those, and we\u2019ve already started in mid-2022 to mitigate some of those. They\u2019ll be fully mitigated by 2024. So, I would think just looking out now qualitatively, \u201823 and \u201824 may look similar because you\u2019ve got some different dynamics playing out, and we\u2019ll certainly have to see how inflation plays out over the course of this year. And then, getting back on a more normal cadence, I would say, you would expect from Johnson & Johnson, you know that we like to grow income a little bit faster than sales growth. And you do that by improving your margin profile. We have $60 billion of resources in a given year. So, we\u2019ve got a responsibility, we think, to continue looking at our prioritization, and our processes and technology to make sure that we are being not only as effective as we can be but also as efficient as we can be. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. And Chris, regarding the dynamics in the immunology market, overall, what we see is that the patient mix is changing, putting more pressure in our overall net price by having a higher participation of some channels, we are lower priced. We see those situations continuing into 2023, but not getting worse. Simply the situation that we are now will continue into 2023, but will stabilize from where we are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I had just one on -- a follow-up on guidance. Joe, if you could talk a little bit about following up on some of the conservatism and maybe the bright spots, the China assumptions that you\u2019ve made for procedure disruption and maybe VBP, if you could give us a sense of how long into \u201823, you expect that to go? And then what you assume for the STELARA LOE? And then, on this sort of conservative side on the bright spot, I think you just kind of covered, I guess, the ortho trends. I understand you aim at this mid-single-digit range for performance, but you had a very, very strong back half in the U.S. And I\u2019m just wondering does that kind of strength in ortho and the spine, for example, which is kind of well above sort of historical ranges. Does that kind of continue into \u201823, or are we assuming that we went into in some comp challenges there, or how -- what sort of elements are contemplated in your guidance, that would be helpful? Joe Wolk : Sure. Good morning, Matt. First of all, I guess let me follow up to Terence\u2019s question with respect to how he positioned, conservatism. I probably did miss an opportunity to speak about some of the things that maybe could go better on our behalf. And some of that could be a quicker rebound in China, whether that be in both MedTech or Pharmaceuticals. Right now, we\u2019re assuming there is some carryover effect from the COVID surges we saw in the fourth quarter. The teams on the ground seem to indicate that it\u2019s still persistent, but if that rebounded a little bit quicker. I think also looking at the multiple myeloma portfolio, and the performance of CARVYKTI or TECVAYLI could be significant and opportunities or pockets for upside. We\u2019re obviously excited by the Abiomed acquisition and what that could possibly mean. And bringing the capabilities of Johnson & Johnson, both in terms of scale and reach, presents some opportunity that maybe isn\u2019t in the current projections. So, there are some opportunities for outperformance. Right now, we like where the number is at with respect to that. China and VBP specifically, I would say that is a dynamic that\u2019s not really a new phenomenon for us. We had won a number of tenders at the end of 2021 that were persistent throughout 2022, and we continue to win tenders. And we think over time that the volume and the opportunity to help many more patients will be persistent with that. So, we are -- it\u2019s part of the guidance that we see today that we\u2019ve offered today, but it\u2019s not really much more pronounced in terms of the impact it has on the business versus what we\u2019ve experienced already. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Trung Huynh : Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Just a question on STELARA erosion expectations. So, I was hoping you can give us some thoughts about the cadence of biosimilar products that are going to be coming along this year. None are approved yet. But, can we expect the first company to enter with exclusivity for six months, something we\u2019ve seen with HUMIRA, and then the rest coming in 2\u20194? Or should we expect all the players to come at once? So, any color on this patent answer would be helpful. Thanks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question. And it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on some of your topics there. There\u2019s no approved biosimilars at this time, and we are going to continue to monitor the situation. As we have commented, we expect the erosion curve of STELARA to be likely steeper than that of REMICADE, given the evolution of the biosimilar market and the fact that STELARA is a self-administered product, as well as potentially to your point, potentially interchangeability in the label. So, that\u2019s how we see the STELARA loss of exclusivity. In 2023, when we think about the STELARA in the U.S., we see the sales of STELARA flat to declining, obviously, given the price pressures. That will be offset also by continuous volume growth that we see in STELARA. So, that\u2019s the perspective that we have for STELARA in 2023. Overall, we have a very strong immunology franchise. I commented on TREMFYA before, the continuous progression in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the readout of our ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease studies, which is exciting. And also, in 2023, we may have some data from our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23, which we think it\u2019s a very exciting underappreciated opportunity in our pipeline, too. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. The multiple myeloma franchise, obviously, very central to your objective for 2025. Between the CAR-T sort of gradual launch that you have based upon supply and the bispecifics, can you talk about what that interplay has been since the approval and launch, and what you\u2019re expecting through the year in 2023? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : As far as the demand for CARVYKTI, we see very strong demand for CARVYKTI and also for TECVAYLI. There\u2019s a significant need for new therapies in this relapsed/refractory patient population. So, the demand for the products, the physicians and patient adoption has been really strong. So, that is really encouraging and pertains the unmet medical need for these types of patients. With CARVYKTI, we continue to scale our production capacity and expand our network of providers, and we are doing that in a phased approach. With TECVAYLI, we are off to a successful start and the early indications for this of the self-option are very, very positive, too, connected with the high unmet medical need that we see there. Moving into 2023, key elements of that would be, from a data perspective, the reading CARTITUDE-4, which would give us the opportunity to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Also the filing of Talquetamab, which will give us another line of therapy, because some of the studies of Talquetamab are done in patients who have failed BCMA, either cell therapy or bispecifics, and the continuous data that we\u2019ll continue to provide to guide how to use this incredible portfolio in multiple myeloma. Jessica Moore : Sorry. Sorry, Kevin. We have time for one last question. Operator : Perfect. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is live now. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. So I wanted to ask you about the timing of data readouts first half or second half and your expectations for a few products. First one is nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis. And then, your oral IL-23 I saw that a trial was finished and what your next steps are here and when you might have some data? And then lastly, just on your RYBREVANT and lazertinib, are you still expecting a potential interim readout for lung cancer here? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : So, regarding the main data readouts that you could expect in 2023, I mean, I commented already on CARTITUDE-4, which is a key one for us. Again, this is an event-driven study, so it\u2019s difficult for us to give you exact timing, Louise. Importantly, we have the potential for an interim analysis on the Mariposa study, which is the study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations in this study versus Tagrisso. And this is an important study for us. And also, we have the potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study, which is in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. So, those are important ones in non-small cell lung cancer. And then, staying in oncology, we also have the data for the -- from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of our TAR-200 platform, our drug-eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we continue to work on our high-risk localized prostate cancer with ERLEADA. So, that\u2019s key elements in our oncology side. As far as nipocalimab, we are expecting data from our Phase 3 studies in RA, in rheumatoid arthritis, which I know has created significant attention from you and also in hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. It will be towards the later part of the year. That\u2019s when you can expect those data to come up. And then, keeping with important date targets next year, we\u2019ll also have the data reads in our 2 IBD studies, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease with TREMFYA. Finally, important progress in our pipeline is that we will be starting our Phase 3 clinical program with milvexian, our Factor XI anticoagulant with our partners at Bristol-Myers Squibb. So, I would say, a very important year for us in terms of data read. That will also include our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23. It\u2019s difficult for us to give you an exact time line, but we fully expect that to happen in 2023. So, many important data reads for us that will showcase the good execution that we\u2019re having in our pipeline. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions that you may have. I would now like to turn it over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : So thank you, everyone, for your questions and interest in Johnson & Johnson. While we have highlighted some of the challenges that we have in the macro environment, we think that 2023 is going to be another exciting year for innovation, for patients. And you can rely on us on delivering strong financial performance for both, the near and the long term. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 first quarter business results and full year financial outlook. Joining me on today's call are Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech. Unfortunately, Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals is not feeling well and is unable to join us today. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.6% versus the first quarter of 2022. Operational sales, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales increased 1.8%. Operational sales outside the U.S. increased 8.3% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 6.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 7.4% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S. with all three segments growing sequentially over the fourth quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net loss was $68 million and basic loss per share was $0.03 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 one-year ago primarily driven by the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, representing a decrease of 0.9% and an increase of 0.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2022 and therefore, exclude the impact currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.4% with an increase of 11.4% in the U.S. and an increase of 4.4% outside the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11.3% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 11.3%. Results were primarily driven by global strategic price increases across all franchises. Volume growth in OTC was due to an exceptionally strong cough, cold and flu season most pronounced in Europe, coupled with one-time retailer restocking primarily in the U.S. related to low inventory levels due to tripledemic demand. Skin Health/Beauty delivered double-digit growth driven by price actions, lapping prior year supply constraints and current quarter restocking as well as strong NEUTROGENA and AVEENO e-commerce and club channel performance and new product innovations. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.4 billion increased 4.2% with growth of 5.9% in the U.S. and 2.4% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 7.2% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 8.6%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales increased 4.9%, U.S. operational sales increased 7.1%, and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 2.4%. Pharmaceutical growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with eight assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 25.7% and 40.3%, respectively. STELARA grew 9.6% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 2.2 points and 4.8 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and price. TREMFYA grew 11% driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 0.9 points and 2.1 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Turning to newly launched products. We are excited to disclose CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO sales for the first-time this quarter. We continue to make progress on our thoughtful and phased launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. Also, we are encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. This sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased by 7.3% with growth of 16.6% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.6% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 6.2%. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6.4%. Sales in the first quarter accelerated sequentially from Q4 for all four MedTech businesses, driven by global procedure growth, continued uptake of recently launched products, and commercial execution. As anticipated, in China, procedure volumes improved as the quarter progressed. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 41.9%, which includes $324 million related to Abiomed. We are excited about the progress of the integration to which Joe will provide additional context. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, this franchise delivered another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 12.3%. As we continue to increase our reporting transparency, beginning this quarter, we are providing visibility to electrophysiology sales. Electrophysiology continued to deliver double-digit sales growth in all regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific, which reflects impacts related to volume-based procurement in China. Orthopaedics operational growth of 5.1% reflects the strong procedure recovery and success of recently launched products especially digital and enabling technologies driving pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume based procurement in China, primarily in hips and spine. Global growth of 9.3% in contact lens and other reflects continued penetration of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and strategic price actions. Growth in contact lens and U.S. surgical vision was tempered by continued supply challenges. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs in the Pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation and acquisition-related items in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 60 basis points driven by proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 2.9% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was an expense of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in expense was the result of the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023 as previously disclosed. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 90.8% versus 12.2% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the $6.9 billion accrual for the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 13.3% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at the adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 35.1% to 34.2%. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 44.1% to 43.2% driven primarily by mix, partially offset by proactive management of costs. MedTech margins remained flat at 27% driven primarily by inflationary impacts, offset by proactive management of costs. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 22.1% to 22.3% driven primarily by strategic price actions, partially offset by input cost inflation. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2023 results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining today's call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational performance across our business. The results reflect the strength and versatility of Johnson & Johnson and our commitment to improving health care outcomes around the world. 2023 has many important catalysts that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. We remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue, which will position both companies to be more agile, focused and competitive. We are also expecting a number of pipeline advancements that will provide increased confidence in our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered a strong first quarter. Growth from our Pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by key assets in our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as uptake from new launches such as SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. 2023 is an important year of scientific innovation for our Pharmaceutical business. And in Q1, we announced that CARVYKTI, our BCMA cell therapy, met its primary endpoint in the CARTITUDE-4 study, a Phase 3 trial in multiple myeloma patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. We look forward to presenting these results in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, our partners at Protagonist Therapeutics announced positive top line results from the Phase 2b FRONTIER 1 study of our Oral IL-23 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We look forward to sharing this data and future development plans at an upcoming medical meeting. Finally, as we continually review our portfolio to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment and an assessment of the RSV vaccine landscape, the company made the decision to discontinue its investigational RSV adult vaccine program. This decision is part of a broader effort to make strategic choices for our pipeline and R&D investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect important data from key pipeline assets such as Nipocalimab and TREMFYA as well as the potential approval of Talquetamab. Importantly, I want to mention two additional highlights. First, the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer remains on track with the potential for final analysis later this year. We are also excited to present data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in muscle invasive bladder cancer at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting this month, which demonstrated a promising complete response and safety profile. Regarding our Pharmaceutical business, I'd like to reiterate some comments I recently made at the Cowen Investor Conference in March related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the impact on the 2025 Pharmaceutical sales goal the team put forth during the 2021 Investor Day. While we don't speculate on currency, based on the current rates, the 2025 sales target of $60 billion is approximately $57 billion on a constant currency basis. In 2022 alone, FX had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in Pharmaceuticals. While that is the math qualitatively since 2021, a number of things have changed in our portfolio. On the plus side, we've seen acceleration of some current and potential upcoming launches like TECVAYLI and Talquetamab. But (ph) to be balanced, we've also experienced competitive pressure on IMBRUVICA above what was anticipated in 2021. So many push and pulls, but we are striving to attain our operational goals. We are confident in our ability to exceed 2025 estimates The Street has out there today of approximately $54 billion. MedTech delivered a strong quarter of sales growth. We continued to advance key pipeline programs. For example, within our electrophysiology business, we reached a few milestones this quarter related to our pulse field ablation pipeline programs, including the European clinical study inspIRE, which achieved early success by meeting both primary safety and efficacy endpoints. Additionally, we announced completion of the first procedures in the European SmartfIRE clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our investigational dual energy catheter, which combines both pulse field and radio frequency ablation capabilities. As you know, we continue to prioritize investment in high growth areas, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Abiomed, which closed this past December. With Abiomed, MedTech now has 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. While it is still early days, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Abiomed. Patient utilization of Abiomed technologies grew mid to high-teens in both Europe and the United States and over 30% in Japan. We continue to see strong adoption of newer technologies, such as Impella 5.5 and we achieved record quarterly enrollment in both the STEMI-DTU and PROTECT IV pivotal trials as we continue to advance efforts in pursuit of Class I guidelines. For perspective, operational sales growth compared to the same quarter last year reported by Abiomed as a standalone company was 22%. In Orthopaedics, just this month, we obtained CE Mark for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, positioning us to expand our international footprint with this differentiated solution in total knee. Finally, the MedTech team is excited by the progress being made in regards to the Ottava general surgery robotic solution, and we remain on track to share more information in the second half of this year. Our Consumer Health business delivered double-digit first quarter sales growth driven by strategic price actions, strong demand and some stock replenishment. We remain on track to complete the separation of this business in 2023, assuming accommodative market conditions. Since the start of the year, we have been operating our Consumer Health business as a company within a company and continue to update our Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the opportunity to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the separation. Standup cost and stranded costs remain consistent with what we have stated previously with an active program well underway to reduce the stranded costs. Turning to notable enterprise events. I'd like to briefly touch on LTL's re-filing for bankruptcy on April 4. Neither LTL's original filing nor this re-filing is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing nor an indication that the company has changed its long-standing position that its talcum powder products are safe. Our goal continues to be for an equitable and efficient resolution of the cosmetic talc litigation against the company, and we believe this refiling represents progress towards that goal. As a reminder, LTL's bankruptcy filing will not have an impact upon the Kenvue separation, and the talc liabilities in the United States and Canada will remain with Johnson & Johnson. As part of the re-filing, we have proposed a reorganization plan that had significant support from Claimants and includes a payment of $8.9 billion in present value over a 25-year period. LTL will continue to work through the process set forth by the bankruptcy court and expects to present the reorganization plan to the court in mid-May. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And in 2022, we successfully executed against all pillars. R&D investment remains our number one priority and driver of long-term growth and value creation. We know the value our investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.3% increase, marking our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic business development opportunities that enable Johnson & Johnson to create value for patients, customers and shareholders. Our final priority is share repurchase programs when appropriate. In fact, this past quarter, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program announced late last year. We are confident in our strong financial position, including our AAA-rated balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital across all strategic priorities. We believe this strength differentiates Johnson & Johnson and enables us to pull the appropriate levers to set us up for long-term success. Moving on to our full year 2023 guidance for the enterprise. Based on our strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 up 1 percentage point in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, or up $1 billion in a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth up 1 percentage point in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at 1.08. The euro spot rate as of late last week was 1.10. We continue to estimate there would be minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year as the dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies. We are maintaining the guidance we provided in January for our adjusted pre-tax operating margin, other income and expense, interest expense and tax rate. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 per share and tightening the range to $10.50 to $10.60, or $10.55 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, or 4% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. This favorable currency impact, coupled with our strong operational outlook, results in an increase to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year by $0.10 per share and tightening the range to $10.60 to $10.70, or $10.65 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4.5% to 5.5%, or 5% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. In Pharmaceuticals, we maintain our expectation of delivering above market growth in 2023 driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. This growth considers the potential composition of matter patent expiry of STELARA, which we currently assume will occur in late 2023 in the United States. Further, we continue to expect 2023 impact from other post-LOE products, including REMICADE, ZYTIGA and XEPLION as well as increased austerity measures across Europe. Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we do not anticipate material sales beyond that which were recorded in the first quarter as our contractual commitments are complete. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by increased procedures and commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels for the remainder of the year with normal seasonality. Regarding quarterly phasing, given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it is important to take into consideration prior year comparisons as well as the robust cough, cold and flu season and the one-time restocking that occurred in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first half of 2022 was impacted by supply constraints. A few brief announcements before we take your questions. Continuing our efforts to increase our transparency and assist with your modeling, we are planning to post a patent table, including U.S. pharmaceutical patents, to our investor website in the quarter. In addition, please mark your calendars for December 5, as we will be hosting an enterprise business review at the New York Stock Exchange focused on the new Johnson & Johnson, highlighting both our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. We will provide additional details about the event in the coming months. Before we turn to your questions, let me state how proud we are regarding our team's continued hard work and unwavering commitment. Our sights are set on the future, focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson. We are confident that our current plans position us for near-term success, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thank you so much. Just maybe a two-parter on the pharma side. First, on the $57 billion target for pharma, I think your comments are very clear in terms of your confidence of exceeding consensus of $54 billion. Are you still confident though in that $57 billion target as we think about kind of the pushes and pulls that you just outlined there? And then maybe just a specific question on RYBREVANT. Just want to make sure the comments correctly there. I think you mentioned there's a final analysis of MARIPOSA later this year. Does that mean the interim has passed at this point? And maybe just put some context of what you think you need to show in that study to dislodge share from TAGRISSO. Thank you. Joe Wolk : Hey. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions. So first, with respect the $57 billion. I wanted to make sure that I was clear on the record since I had the opportunity to do that about a month ago that everybody understood the message around the math component of it. We feel very good about our pipeline. We continue to work towards some really good data that came out this quarter around multiple myeloma, MARIPOSA, which we'll talk about in a minute. We continue to see some uptake of some of our newer products and the goal is still that for us. But you'll have a much better and much more informed and probably timely update once we hit the December 5 meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, so stay posted on that. What I do feel comfortable though is that we're moving certainly in the right direction. I wanted to take out the unclarity that maybe was created by currency and the dramatic movements that occurred over the last 18 months. So for MARIPOSA, I would say the study of RYBREVANT and Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer versus TAGRISSO remains very much on track. It's an event-driven trial. So there's the potential for final analysis later this year, which is actually two quarters ahead than what we had originally expected, was originally expected to be second quarter of 2024. The accrual to the study we can say is very rapid as there was tremendous interest. And the interim analysis was specified in the protocol with a significantly limited follow-up and supported the continuation of the study. We were blinded to that interim analysis. And as far as what we need to show, I think we\u2019re just going to let the science dictate, let the trial results come out. But we feel pretty comfortable where we\u2019re at now and pleased with how quickly the trial enrolled. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matt Miksic : Great. Thanks so much. I have, if I could, just one question on knees and a quick follow-up, kind of a general strategy question on STELARA and pharma if I could. So on knees in the U.S., obviously, very strong growth. And just wondering if you could, and I think expectations have been strong throughout Q1. I just was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color as to what's driving that strength? How much of that is maybe the robot? How much of that is on other product launches and then one quick follow-up on pharma, if I may. Ashley McEvoy : Matt, thank you for the question. And before I turn it to Joe on STELARA, it's really nice to see 12% growth in the U.S. for knees. We haven't seen that in a while. But before I get into specifically knees, maybe just a quick frame on like the quarter. Obviously, first, the industry I think continues to remain strong and growing. Procedures are well in recovery mode. It's awesome to see an 11% operational performance and 6.4 adjusted ops for the first quarter. It was our first quarter with Abiomed. So if you look at them on like-for-like periods, it's a standalone of 22% growth. But I think when I look at all of the math, if you will, for the quarter, what I'm most pleased about is really the balanced growth. And we had our BWI business up 13%. Our global vision, up 8%. And our U.S. business, the largest market, growing north of 8% really fueled by ortho performance, up 6% as well as surgery up 6%. And you hear us talk about this 12 $1 billion platform, but six of those grew double-digit in the United States in the quarter. EMEA was strong, and Asia was a little bit softer again by China. Obviously, Jan and Feb was a bit softer. We were encouraged with March procedures recovered in March. But I would call it three specific innovations, and then I'll go deeper into knees. One is our pulse field ablation. So we're very pleased with the data that an AFib that it's promising. We have four clinical trials ongoing. Two out of the four, we've completed enrollment, and we shared the data from the INSPIRE trial where we met the primary endpoint for both safety and efficacy. Our Abiomed, as we've talked about we're about 90 days in. They continue to advance the innovation pipeline. They're in clinic in four clinical trials to expand new products and to expand indications to get designation. And last, I would say, Matt, we are in all things robotics. So let's talk about VELYS. We just received CE Mark positioning it for expansion to more global markets. Right now, we're in five. But I'm pleased to say that it's now the fastest growing knee robotic system in the United States. We've completed over 20,000 procedures. And we're taking a systems approach to our business in hips to shoulders and the spine. Our Monarch platform is the first and only multispecialty flexible robotics solution with FDA clearance in bronchoscopy as well as endo-urology. We've completed 25,000 procedures and are in clinic right now combining the Monarch Endoluminal navigation with ablation treatment technology on new wave. And just recently, in February, we were -- the first patient received robotic-assisted removal of kidney stone. We're trying to get a higher kidney stone clearance rate than the standard of care. And last, as we talked about our team in Ottava is really progressing significantly, really looking forward to a back half of the year update with the team. So VELYS is really a combination of having access to cementless, both on fixed bearing and rotating platform, revision, our new introduction of the medial stabilized knees and most importantly, not just coupled with the robotic system, VELYS, but coupled with the most modern knee implant in the world. Thank you. Matt Miksic : Well, that was a fantastic overview. Thanks for that and congrats on all the innovation and the significant change in momentum across all those businesses. Just a quick question, I guess, I had on pharma was -- I mean, it's a big question, and I think it's on a lot of investors' minds is if we turn into the end of the year and you think about STELARA, and you think about sort of the actions that you expect to take whether organic, the pipeline that you have and as it comes through, and some of these new products launch and get bigger. And then strategic, if you could maybe give a sense of what are your goals over the next 12 months, 18 months as you sort of whether that LOE and what sort of mix of action should we expect you to take to kind of manage through that? Thanks. Joe Wolk : Sure. Thanks, Matt for the question. A lot to maybe unpack possibly there. But let me first start with our base assumption, the guidance, which has the underlying assumption that in the U.S., STELARA will lose exclusivity in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year and that's kind of the assumption that we're going on. What I would say is that's somewhat fluid. At this point, there are currently no biosimilars approved. In terms of our planning, we are expecting -- despite learning a lot over the last few years with REMICADE, we're expecting a steeper erosion curve than what was experienced there because this is a self-administered subcutaneous product. There will be multiple competitors on the market at some point, and they may have the affordability of interchangeability. But we may remain committed to growing through the patent exploration. One of the, the great things about our portfolio, whether we're talking within Pharmaceuticals or across the broader businesses, we've got 30 products or platforms that generate over $1 billion in annual revenue. So we're not dependent on one product the way others may have. In terms of unpacking your question maybe a little bit further, I got the sense you were heading towards M&A. Certainly, we always remain vigilant and look at a number of opportunities, making sure there's a strategic fit before we act. If there's a strategic fit, then we're going to look to deploy capital in the way that returns to shareholders to compensate them, quite frankly for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. But we're not going to do anything out of desperation based on the breadth of our product portfolio. We are lucky in that we've got a strong balance sheet to do whatever we'd like, but we want to make sure it makes good strategic and financial sense. So that's probably the best way to answer that. I know Jennifer and the team are very committed to growing through the loss of STELARA whenever that may occur. And the pipeline data that we\u2019re generating now as well as really the early success we\u2019re having in some of these newer products, I think, positions us well to meet those goals. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a two-part one for me as well. Thanks for the update on the talc litigation, Joe. I was just wondering if you could comment at all about any additional progress towards that 75% threshold, specifically the denominator and kind of where that's shaking out? And then on the Oral IL-23 program there, just wondering if you can confirm if you're going to advance into Phase 3 and where that drug might be positioned ultimately in the treatment paradigm based on the data you guys have seen thus far. Thank you. Joe Wolk : Great. Thanks for the question, Terence. Let me start with the second one first with respect to the Oral IL-23, where our partners at Protagonist announced some, for very encouraging data out of the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 study. So we do plan to present data from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on this compound at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of this year. We believe this could be very much an important and underappreciated asset within our immunology portfolio. With respect to the litigation, we thought that this could come up as a question. So we're very pleased to have Andrew White, our Assistant General Counsel, here with us today. But let me say a little maybe a couple of qualitative things from my seat, and then we can have Andrew either clean it up or give you some more specifics. But it is important to note that these cases and we stand by the safety of the product, there's decades of independent research conducted by reputable government agencies, patient advocacy groups as well as academic institutions that support the safety of cosmetic talc. Furthermore, it was only two years ago, [indiscernible] hearing where the judge really restricted the use of many of the claims, supposedly scientific claims that were being made by the plaintiff attorneys in this case and many pundits even classified it as junk (ph) signs at that point. Here, we have the support of 60,000 to 70,000 claimants that would vote for the proposal as it's currently presented. But curiously, we've got a small number of plaintiff's attorneys who don't even want to give their claimants, the right to vote. So we're simply asking that they get the right to vote. Now from my chair as CFO, it is unfortunate that we've got to put dollars towards, quite frankly, baseless scientific claims. However, litigation is inherently costly when it's protracted and it's also inherently uncertain. And when court (ph) proposal really aims to bring certainty in a very efficient manner for all really involved, something that would otherwise take probably decades to resolve. So let me turn it over to Andrew in terms of maybe any of the specifics that you can add. Andrew White : Yeah. Good morning, Terence. Thanks, Joe. As Joe mentioned, we are very confident in the position that we stand today in terms of support for the plan. We have well over 60,000 that have expressed a desire to vote for this plan. And the expectation is that we will move forward with a reorganization plan to present to the court within the next 30 days and hope to quickly move to a vote. And we believe once we put that plan out for a vote, we'll gain even more support from a small, but I would say, vocal minority of attorneys. So we believe we're going to reach that 75% threshold and look forward to getting that plan out to a vote. A \u2013 Joe Wolk : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, two for you on the guidance. I heard you on CNBC this morning, and you said you turned from cautious in January to optimistic now about 2023. So I was curious about two things. One, on the guidance you previously expected second half to be better than the first half in MedTech and Pharma because of the growth drivers you outlined on the Q4 call, so what changed there? Why do you expect growth to be more stable through the year? And second, Joe, on the margins. Q1 was up about 60 basis points year-over-year in Q1 on the operating margin, but you expect -- and you expect gross margins to improve through 2023 as inflation wanes. So why would the operating margin be flat for the full year? Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Wolk : Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Well, first, I do want to correct the record a little bit on you. Responsibly was in front of both cautious as well as optimistic. So we've moved from responsibly cautious to responsibly optimistic. Why do I say that? It's because we did see some dynamics within our P&L, the team's great ability to really manage our resources effectively with the backdrop of really a company separation that could lend itself to some stranded costs. We're managing those extremely well. There is still inflation within the P&L. I don't think we should say that it's now behind us. We have a good data point with respect to where we landed Q1. I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and the strength of that and why we've maybe moved from a little bit more of a consistent approach throughout the year versus a stronger second half from the first half is really around the first quarter results. So in terms of Pharmaceutical pricing, it was still unfavorable as you might expect with respect to Pharmaceutical, but not as unfavorable as we anticipated. And then maybe Ashley can talk here, too. When we came out in January, there was -- the pandemic was kind of full blown in the Asia Pacific region. And we did see a very positive data point in March with respect to China specifically. I don't know, Ashley, anything to add there? Ashley McEvoy : Yeah. No, Larry, what I would share is, I would say that procedures are trending well above all pre-COVID levels. It was up until December with the exception of China. China in December, January and February were well below pre-COVID levels. In January trending like, down (ph) 50%. So I am encouraged to see in March that, they are back up. They are back up a little bit ahead of pre-COVID levels. And so that's why we're kind of rebalancing the year. I think that we're going to have more stability throughout the balance to go year versus earlier thinking that we would be having a stronger second half versus first half. Joe Wolk : Yeah. And Larry with respect to operating margins, it's still very early in the year. It's still only April. If we have the opportunity to manage these macroeconomic headwinds that we ended the year with and then maybe provide the flexibility for further investment for great opportunities down the road that fortify the future, we'll certainly look to do that. You guys know us well enough that if we don\u2019t find those meaningful opportunities, we\u2019ll probably have the opportunity to take up guidance down the road. But my first preference would be to deploy that in investment opportunities that secure both MedTech and Pharmaceuticals for the future. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So I had a Pharmaceutical question for you. You've built a really strong oncology franchise and what are some unique approaches you think you can take to create combos and regimens that might not be available to other companies? And are there any additional areas in oncology that you would like to be involved in that you are not now currently involved in? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Louise. So I think we're always looking at combinations. The one that's most prolific at this point now is certainly one for non-small cell lung cancer, which really impacts about 20% of lung cancer that's diagnosed today with a certain mutation. We're very much looking forward to the data that may read-out later this year with respect to that. In terms of new areas, I know that the teams are looking very much. I would say some of the new areas that we're coming into now would be some of the bispecific antibodies with respect to multiple myeloma rounding out that portfolio. We know how I want to say almost personalized that disease is and having multiple options for treatments and maybe even someday potentially cures certainly lends itself with the multiple options that we have. We're going to be focused on multiple myeloma, obviously, prostate cancer, lung cancer. We're very excited about some of the data that could read out on what I'll call the MedTech, Pharma combo of -- for bladder cancer and with the TARIS device with the drug eluting BALVERSA. So there's multiple plays within oncology, which is now our biggest franchise with immunology in terms of sales contribution to the pharmaceutical success. Jessica Moore : The only aspect that I'd add to Louise is, as you know, our multiple myeloma platform is extremely strong. And we're looking at some multiple clinical trials about not cannibalizing those products, but rather looking at combination treatments as well as sequences of those products between TECVAYLI, DARZALEX, CARVYKTI and then hopefully our soon to be approved Talquetamab. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Had a question for Ashley just on the [indiscernible] PFA platform. I was hoping that just get an update on commercial time lines. Anything you can share just in terms of CE Mark and then FDA approvals. And then maybe digging a little bit deeper, just helping us understand. I mean, our expectation is that [indiscernible] will be third to market in the United States, but what percentage of [indiscernible] revenues are levered to the ablation catheter segment within the EP industry? And then what drives your optimism that [indiscernible] will maintain -- be able to maintain [indiscernible] position in the ablation catheter segment? Thanks for taking the questions. Ashley McEvoy : Yeah. Thank you, Josh. Listen, it's a really important space. And we always say at J&J, we're always trying to intercept disease before it advances. And this is one example of managing atrial fibrillation, which is the leading cause of cardiac arrhythmia (ph) and unmanaged, that could lead to a stroke. So what gives us confidence that we can lead and compete and have a source of differentiation, I would say kind of the following. I'd say, one, we have a 20-year track record of being a world leader in cardiac ablation. We have 5,000 plus installed base. We do see the promise of PSA. We are actively engaged in four clinical trials. Two of those trials have completed enrollment. The European and INSPIRE as well as the U.S. We've shared data in February in the international AFib symposium that we met the primary endpoint. And I would tell you, our approach is really what's differentiated, Josh. So we're kind of leveraging a deep expertise and the insights into the various ablation strategies. So we have a portfolio of PFA catheters, which are fully integrated into the [indiscernible] system and it's powered by kind of our true pulse generator. So we really underscore the importance of how important mapping is and vision to know where operators are and what they're doing in the heart anatomy. And kind of the bottom line for us is, we actually think access to radio frequency, which has like 20-plus years of safety and efficacy coupled with the newer generation of PFA is really going to be the winning combo for electrophysiologists. It's really why we are in clinic right now with the dual energy solution because we think it could offer the relative safety of the PFA and really the proven durability of radio frequency. So we're not issuing specific timelines, but you can know that we've completed enrollment in two of those four clinical trials. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I have two related ones in Pharma. So on IMBRUVICA, how do you guys view the impact from the indication withdrawal and is there a risk of other non-CLL indications like follicular being pulled? And then related to your hematology business, do you guys have a status update on CARVYKTI supply after or was this quarter a really good quarter? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Geoff. So with respect to IMBRUVICA, I would say that we're not expecting any more withdrawals at this point. It is obviously based on our performance, encountering competitive pressures. But it's really the competition that's been the biggest driver in terms of the performance that we're not seeing there, quite frankly. But it's -- the withdrawal was a very small part of our business to begin with, but we don't anticipate other withdrawals at this point. With respect to your second question and supply on CARVYKTI, I would say that you probably did read the announcement recently that we did sign on for additional capacity to scale up some production and increase availability moving forward. The manufacturing is ramping up to supply markets. We have really tremendous demand given some of the data that supports this CARVYKTI, the CAR-T for Johnson & Johnson. And we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can to accelerate our manufacturing abilities to meet that demand. We work in our facility and again continues to progress. And it will serve as an important part of our supply chain network for not just this but other cell therapies in the future. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Geoff. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and it's good to be back talking to you all. Ashley, just a quick question for you on the Orthopaedics number. A very good quarter. I was just wondering, I know this is really hard to parse out, but what is -- from your sense, what does backlog work down versus real underlying growth and/or more specific to J&J share gain? Anything you can say on how to think about what's happening in the Orthopaedics market right now in the U.S.? Thanks so much. Ashley McEvoy : No. Thank you, Danielle. It's great to hear your voice. Listen, it's really a combination of both. Procedures are accelerating, particularly like even as recently as March in China, as an example, U.S. working through some of the backlog. So I do think that the market is in our favor. But at the same time, I have to give huge acknowledgment to the Orthopaedics team, who has really built a very differentiated portfolio. And they are now participating in the fastest growing segments within the Orthopaedics category. So if the category is going three to four, they're competing in areas that are high-single digit. And what are those areas? It's all things robotics. It's around new sites of care like, ASCs. It's around extremities. I'm very pleased with our recent acquisition of [indiscernible], a foot and ankle. It's what we talked about around revision needs and cementless needs. Those are really the faster-growing segments in Orthopaedics, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that demand. Thank you for the question. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. Enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 second quarter business results and full-year financial outlook. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Erik Haas, Worldwide Vice President of Litigation. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.j&j.com and on the SEC website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting business performance achievements in the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year. I will then review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. Finally, Erik will provide comments regarding the talc litigation. The remaining time will be available for your questions. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical, our MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceutical and MedTech, while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech, for the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in Electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest Ablation Catheter for Atrial Fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86%, as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfiRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source whether radio frequency or pulsed field based on patient needs. The Abiomed integration continued to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson & Johnson. In orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals. In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches along with SPRAVATO are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target. We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I\u2019m particularly excited by include : first, the receipt of fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options, due to bleeding risk. Second, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting. And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT based regimens in EGFR mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our Novel Oral IL23 Receptor Antagonist Peptide in Psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase 2b in ulcerative colitis and will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents $1 billion plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025 and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson & Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail. Jess? Jessica Moore : Thanks, Joaquin. As a reminder on May 8, 2023, Kenvue, Inc., closed its initial public offering. Johnson & Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue\u2019s common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the consumer health business with the 10.4% of consumer health's net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson & Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter. Starting with Q2 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.7% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth with 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1%, with growth of 9.2% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 3.8% as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, Worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2% with growth of 9.9% in the U.S. and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. STELARA grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates. TREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the U.S. and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. Total pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9% with growth of 14.6% in the U.S. and 11.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 14.7% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution, partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume based procurement in China, as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RS catheter. Orthopedics operational growth of 5.7%, reflects strong procedure recovery, success of recently launched products, such as the enhanced shorter portfolio, as well as global expansion of our digital solutions, such as VELYS Robotic assisted solution. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% and surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 6.9% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges. Although these continue to improve. Moving to the Consumer Health segment. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4% with growth of 6% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all consumer health franchises, primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally, due to strong pain performance, and cold, cough and flu season. Excluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related costs in the pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense, and lower unrealized losses on securities, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related cost. And as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of consumer health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson & Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax cost incurred as part of the planned separation of the consumer health business, due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix, sales, marketing and administrative expense leverage, and R&D portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments. MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, driven by favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5%, due to incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, foreign exchange impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the consumer health business as reported by Johnson & Johnson defers from the financial results reported by Kenvue Inc. this morning. The difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after tax basis, due to the application of different tax rates. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first-half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased to 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first-half of the year we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8th, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson & Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue, subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson's shareholders will have the choice to exchange all some or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders, specifically an exchange offer provides Johnson & Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at one time in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of 10 Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends, increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&D investment in the first-half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022, and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split off transaction I will remind you that our updated full-year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health Business given Johnson & Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson & Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson & Johnson. When Johnson & Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson & Johnson guidance that will reflect among other things the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson & Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full-year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full-year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in process research and development cost related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The Euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the Won and the Yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5%, compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company\u2019s 10.4% non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of a $150 million to $250 million, due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution recently launched products and improvement in supply. Headwinds from volume based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second-half than the first-half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first-half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near-term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there are still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO Catheter in the U.S. during the second-half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution, recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations such as ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson & Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front there is expected approval of [daratumumab] (ph) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect a Phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in front line non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting. Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Phase 2 data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health For Humanity report our U.S. Pharmaceutical pricing transparency report and our U.S. patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5th. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first-half of the year both financially and operationally and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second-half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas. Erik Haas : Thank you, Joe. On Tuesday, July 18th in the case of Valadez v Johnson & Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on this talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with a decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40-years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc. The verdict award will not be paid, while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on a -- our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy re-filing by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2nd the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed, reorganization plan and voting procedures process, and the path forward is scheduled for August 22nd. As we previously stated, Johnson & Johnson stands by its physician that is talcum powder products are safe as confirmed through decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Erik. This concludes the prepared remarks section of our call. I will now turn the discussion over to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on another strong quarter here. For Erik, if Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy proposal, what's the backup settlement in mind that would proceed outside of bankruptcy that could ring fence the cost? And Joe or Joaquin, in MedTech, how are you thinking about the sustainability of the first half strength where you grew 8% organic? Do you still expect the MedTech market to grow 5% to 7% this year with J&J in that range, it seems conservative? Thanks for taking the question. Erik Haas : Larry, hi it's Erik. Thanks for the question. If Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy, we will be back in the tort system, and in that scenario we intend to fight the claims aggressively. And indeed, based upon the indicated decades of scientific support for the safety of our talc products, the fact that our talc products do not contain asbestos and the fact that our talc products do not cause cancer, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to prevail in the vast majority of claims as we have done in the past in the tort system. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Larry, and thank you for complimenting us on the results on the first quarter and also on the MedTech ones. When it comes to the MedTech results, the growth in the first-half of the year was north of 8%. So this is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite. When we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple. One is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping our improved commercial execution and very especially the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market. We see our trajectory in MedTech in the first-half of the year continuing in the second-half of the year. So we expect a similar trajectory for MedTech in the second-half of the year. Joe Wolk : Yes, Larry, maybe I might just add to Joaquin's comments. The only thing that is limiting the growth, I would say, in the back half of the year is China volume-based pricing, as well as some international sanctions in Russia, but those are already incorporated into our outlook for the balance of 2023. So we feel we have those well in hand. If there's a little bit of abatement on either of those fronts, it portends well for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Vamil Divan : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So maybe just one on the guidance commentary. So appreciate what you said around the Kenvue and Cellular Biomedicine dynamics. But I'm curious about STELARA, because you have the two settlements now. I don't think there's any chance for having a biosimilar enter this year. And I think before, you had expected that. So I'm curious what your expectations are now in terms of biosimilar entry before Amgen? And how does that impact sort of your guidance expectation for this year, and if you want to comment on sort of next year or sort of how it might impact 2025 with the $57 billion there? And then one also, other one if I could just on MARIPOSA, we've been getting a lot of questions just sort of what's changed there? I know before, the study is supposed to end next year. We obviously heard about the interim on your last earnings call. But then in the last few weeks, it sounds like there's a chance we'll get the data sooner this year than you may be able to present it. So kind of what's changed from April to now to give you a sense that the data may come a little bit earlier and give you a chance to present it this year? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Thanks for the questions, Vamil. I'll start with STELARA and then see if Erik can add anything from a legal perspective, and then we'll hand it over to Joaquin for your question on the MARIPOSA study. With respect to STELARA this year, there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full-year about this time last year. So there really wasn't any material impact. And our current assumption based on some of the agreements you read about similar to what we've said previously is that we wouldn't expect anything before January 1, 2025. I don't know, Erik, from a legal perspective, anything to add? Erik Haas : Yes. Thanks, Joe. From a litigation perspective, I could say that no other biosimilar is better positioned in our view than Amgen or Alvotech would be. So we would not anticipate any other biosimilar having the opportunity or ability to enter the market before those two. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. And with respect to MARIPOSA, nothing has changed. We -- this is an event-driven study with a final analysis expected as we said by the end of 2023 with a potential to be presented at a major medical meeting in 2023. We remain excited about the potential of RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib to become a new standard-of-care in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. And we are looking forward to be able to present these results in due time in a medical meeting potentially this year. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I'm trying to think about two things as I look forward to, given the strength in the first half of the year in MedTech, does this create, in your opinion, a new base from which we grow from? Or are we going to be writing about difficult comps next year? And second of all, with Kenvue's splitoff by within days or by the end of this year, I anticipate, how do we think about different investments in the MedTech and Pharmaceutical franchises either through pure R&D internally or externally? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : So as I commented in the earlier question, we are pleased with the strength of our MedTech business in the first-half of the year with 8% growth. We -- this is driven by market growth, which we believe it's also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog. And at the same time, as I commented to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products. Of note, of our $12 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first-half of the year. And we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology, that grew north of 25% in the quarter. We have introduced a new mapping catheter OCTARAY and also a new treatment catheter QDOT, which, as you know, Joanne, we presented results about QDOT. So we increased efficacy and procedure efficiency, too. If we move into Vision, we are in the middle of the launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX, which is doing well and also the launch of our TECNIS Eyhance, the first mono-focal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into Orthopaedics. The good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our Robotic-Assisted System VELYS. And we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our Cementless knees, the Medial Stabilized and in the area of hips with hip navigation and the recent addition of CUPTIMIZE and we see our market position there also progressing. And moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in Orthopaedics. Finally, in Surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL jaw curved and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. So overall, good reception of our new products. That portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year. And we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that is the most well used with the option of having both radio frequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy. And then on the robotic side, we will provide you more updates on our progress on OTTAVA, our soft tissue robotics system, before the end of the year as we committed. And we have also good news on our Monarch system that has already started with the first patient treated in removal of kidney stone. So overall, good progress during the year. Clearly, our MedTech business is doing well, delivering competitive growth. And we have good news in innovation as the year moves forward. Joe Wolk : And Joanne, with respect to your second question and completing the Consumer Health separation, our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. So we're going to continue to invest organically in our own pipeline. You saw that we pretty much have kept our percent to sales, which is -- leads across industries as a top 10 investor in R&D on an annual basis. We prioritize that. We realize that, that is underpinning our future success. As we have demonstrated, the dividends and the share repurchases that we've done this year has already returned a significant amount back to shareholders. And then we'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or science expertise we have or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides. So we are looking feverishly as we always do across both MedTech and Pharm. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just the first one is, would love just some additional views on the $57 billion pharma target by 2025. It seems like between the pipeline progress we've seen this year and the STELARA settlements, you've had some clear positive updates over the past few months. And I'm just wondering, just level of confidence in that target, and has that increased as we've gone through this year? And then my second question was just for Erik on talc. Is there any update in terms of the number of plaintiffs where you have an agreement on the settlement terms relative to where we stood with the comments in April? And just where you stand right now relative to that 75% threshold you ultimately need? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Chris. And let me start with your first question. We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025 as we announced back in 2021. And certainly, what we are seeing now increases and reinforces and enhances our confidence. On one hand, you're seeing the progression of our pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, also in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable antipsychotic franchise, which are key products in this period. We are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and SPRAVATO. If I focus on CARVYKTI, you see a clear improvement quarter-over-quarter in CARVYKTI, which reflects improvements in supply. In TECVAYLI, you see also a clear improvement of note. When we look at the TECVAYLI launch, align data with DARZALEX in the addressable patient population. TECVAYLI it\u2019s having a faster introduction. And finally, SPRAVATO, which is doing well. And now we see SPRAVATO as a $1 billion plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to $170 million. If we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impacting this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. And we continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline. I commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of Lazertinib, as you know. We received fast track destination for the three key indications of milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in meeting in the American Urological Association. And we also -- when it comes to CARVYKTI, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4. We are filing the BLA now, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we are expecting to show you some data on nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the features of the new wall. So in every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis. And we have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. So overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, in our new product launches and how we are executing on our pipeline. But now I would like to look even beyond \u201825 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only three years from now. So what I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson & Johnson in Pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. And that's something that we need to highlight, and I think it's important for everybody to recognize. This is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025. Erik Haas : Turning to the question with respect to the number of claimants. Good and important question. The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on June 30th. And I would refer you to the post-trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last night that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing. Based upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition. So the numbers right now show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan. Based upon the testimony during that hearing from the lawyers that support those claimants, we are confident that, that support will not waver. And we do anticipate that additional support will be coming forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Trung Huynh : Oh, hi. Thanks for the questions. Just two if I may. So just on -- thanks for your thoughts on the talc outcome. Should we just expect any more similar suits like the one in Alameda in the near future? And then secondly, do you know just a clarification on MARIPOSA if another interim passed for MARIPOSA? Thanks very much. Joaquin Duato : So let me start with the MARIPOSA. No, I mean, we are -- as we communicated, we are moving into a final analysis by the end of the year, potentially presenting the data at the end of the year. Erik Haas : And with respect to the talc suits, we don't anticipate additional individual actions to go up for it outside the bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan lifted the stay only with respect to that one particular case, the Valdez case. Indeed, subsequent to that, he denied a request from the same counsel to lift the stay on another case. So currently, I would not anticipate any other case to go forward in advance of a ruling on the motion to dismiss. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for all the color. I had two, I was wondering, Joaquin, we've talked a lot about the myeloma market evolution over the last decade or so. J&J has been a leader there. This is a $20 billion market. You obviously have a number of different options now for patients, including TECVAYLI most recently and talquetamab with upcoming PDUFA date. So I guess my question is just top down, what prevents you from capturing a majority share of that $20 billion market? And then, Joe, a question for you on margins post Kenvue. Any early idea you can give us in terms of how that structure could evolve post the full separation? Joaquin Duato : Yes. So thank you for the question. And the answer is nothing prevents us from doing that. As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that with the portfolio that we have today with DARZALEX, TECVAYLI, talquetamab and CARVYKTI, we would be in a position to have three out of every four patients starting in Janssen containing regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is a Janssen regimen for every line of therapy and a Janssen treatment for every patient irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development. Certainly, DARZALEX being a backbone of therapy, first line and also in combination with multiple agents and then sequencing into CARVYKTI and talquetamab and TECVAYLI, which we are studying in combination with DARZALEX and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them. So ultimately, our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our Pharmaceutical franchise and the number one growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond. There's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area is that as we combine and as we seek those treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease. Joe Wolk : And Terence, thanks for the question regarding margins. And specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple of quarters ago on one of these calls, we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&A. We embarked on an initiative, and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about two to three years to get those costs out of their system. Last summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs in a much faster cadence. And I would say of that $500 million to $750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. So you should expect as you're modeling no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking a question. Just a follow-up on some of the capital allocation commentary. Joe, I appreciate what you're saying that things haven't changed. But I'm just curious now that you guys have integrated Abiomed, you're seeing some success there, how your appetite for specifically within medical devices and MedTech, how your appetite for potentially larger deals may have changed? And are there any specific areas you would call out within cardiology now that you do have Abiomed or just with -- throughout medical devices as areas of interest or where you feel underscaled and you might benefit from building out there? Thanks so much. Joe Wolk : Yes. Good to speak with you Danielle. And I know you directed the question to me, and I'll answer with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point. But I'll leave it to Joaquin with respect to the size of the deals. I don't think it -- unequivocally doesn't change, whether it's big or small, it has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have and has to provide financial value. Joaquin, maybe you want to comment on any specific areas that [Indiscernible]? Joaquin Duato : Yes. Thank you, Danielle. And before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% on the quarter and we continue to move forward with the enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU as well as the Impella ECP. So everything is moving well according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&A, look, we continue to look for opportunities. And our number one criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product. So we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and Pharmaceuticals. It's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today. Vision, cardiovascular obviously, surgery too and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of Orthopaedics. And we normally will continue to look for these opportunities, trying to have a good return on capital, as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to Pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in license and collaboration has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline. And while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with Cellular Biomedicines and the agreement that we have too in CAR-T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very disciplined with our capital allocation. And all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on. But M&A and also licensing acquisition collaborations remains a key factor in our growth moving forward. Jessica Moore : Thanks. We have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi, congratulations on the quarter. And thank you for taking my questions here. So I wanted to ask you where your latest thoughts on IRA are and the potential impact to the drug industry and also to J&J? And second question was just on CARVYKTI. Just curious how you expect to enter into earlier lines of treatment and then more widely into the community? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Yes. So let me start with the IRA. Obviously, we remain very concerned about the government price-setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation without addressing the core problem, which is patient access. So it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as we commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it, given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux. So it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that. In our case, when we look at Johnson & Johnson, relatively speaking towards the industry based on our diversification between MedTech and Pharma and also the diversification of our Pharma portfolio, we feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow way beyond the second-half of this decade. So we remain concerned. But at the same time, we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players. The second question was about CARVYKTI. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve CARVYKTI supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the second quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also, we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally. And also, we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in the trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet the demand that exists in CARVYKTI. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARVYKTI 4, it's already been filed. And it's moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy, and we are also working in first line with CARVYKTI 5 and CARVYKTI -- excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move CARVYKTI through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5, and CARTITUDE-6 into earlier lines of therapy. And we are increasingly convinced of the potential of CARVYKTI to be one of our more than $5 billion assets that we announced back in 2021. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining this call today. I'm extremely proud of the performance that we have achieved in the first-half of 2023. We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including the fact that we are going to be a two-sector company focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech recent development and innovation. We look forward to having future engagements with you to update you on our continued progress. Thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 third quarter business results and full-year financial outlook. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will start by reviewing the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato, our chairman and CEO; John Reed, and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech R&D leaders, as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigation, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. As a reminder, on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Kenvue Inc. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Additionally, going forward, the pharmaceutical segment will be referred to as innovative medicine. Starting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 11.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 0.7% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.9 points. It is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 0.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago. Excluding after-tax and tangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%. I will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with innovative medicine. Worldwide innovative medicine sales of $13.9 billion, increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2%, with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and growth of 4.3% outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from a recently launched products with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27% respectively, due to continued share gains and market growth. Within immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 15.8% and 21.5% respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth and other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total innovative medicine sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA and REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales, due to competitive pressures. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased 10% with growth of 11.6% in the U.S., and 8.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth, excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%. On a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from Abiomed as a standalone company, MedTech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%. MedTech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points in volume-based procurement in China, primarily in five MedTech platforms : Spine, Trauma, Endocutters, Energy, and Electrophysiology. As communicated last quarter, we saw the return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to Abiomed. This reflects growth in Abiomed patient procedures in the high-teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology in surgery. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double-digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OPTRELL Mapping Catheters. Operational growth of 3.2% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 5.4% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Global vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points, due to the Blink divestiture. Orthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products, such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions, and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in Spine and Trauma. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit costs in the innovative medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix, and restructuring related to excess inventory costs in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across the enterprise. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the innovative medicine business. Additionally, IPR&D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on public securities partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs and lower litigation expense. Restructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the innovative medicine restructuring program announced in the first quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pre-tax charge that occurred in the current quarter. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson is presenting the consumer health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and innovative medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in MedTech. Innovative medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&D portfolio prioritization. MedTech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a divestiture gain. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our Credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex healthcare challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of healthcare. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business. The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted timeframe and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue Debt Offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRA's price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by of us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. And U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class, bi-specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA II, and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the Sunrise 1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for Nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November, and have already launched a Phase II combination study NRA. Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase 2B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month, and the Phase III clinical program titled Iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance from multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE mark for our VARIPULSE Catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device, and Omnipulse, a large tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth, and executing share repurchases when appropriate. Moving onto our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full-year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%, or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million. Looking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint, and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint. Since January, We've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us. This includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis, and readouts from two Phase III or ELITA trials in early-stage prostate cancer. We do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels. With respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar 2 Directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar 2 framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and MedTech pipelines, and the long-term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast. I want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long-term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. David Risinger : Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the strong financial performance. So my question is on benchmarking MARIPOSA results, please. Could you share your thoughts on key considerations, including AstraZeneca's recent FLAURA2 results, which included a nine-month PFS benefit? Thanks very much. John Reed : Hi. John, Reed here. It's great to join the call. This is my first time as a newcomer to J&J, and before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our Credo with the caliber of our talent our people here at J&J and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, Akeega for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition in bringing new therapies in those agents, and we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two enemies per year between now and the close of the decade 2030. So the pipeline is very robust and it's exciting to be here and to be a part of it. So on to your question, the data will be presented at ESMO in a Presidential session. So we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on [Wednesday] (ph). I can only say that the RYBREVANT Lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against Osimertinib. Our regimen is a chemo-free option for patients, which we think is important, and we'll present those data at ESMO. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I think most folks may look at the orthopedic results in medical devices as maybe being a little bit softer-than-expected. And I know that's not everything by a long shot for J&J, but given the expectations for continued strength heading, I think, into Q3, if you could talk maybe a little bit about your comment on more traditional seasonality and thoughts on the sustainability of that strength, as well as the sort of divestiture and sort of realignment plan, Joe, that you described. Thanks. Joaquin Duato : So thank you for the question. And yes, I mean, our results in orthopedics were 2.6% growth overall. And part of it, as you mentioned is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in orthopedics. We want to be number one and number two in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio, for example, on the knee side. We have a more complete portfolio now on the revision side, on the cementless side. We are launching now our VELYS orthopedics total robot, total knee surgery replacement in Europe. And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment, and we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of value-based procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the previous remarks. So overall, in orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field, and as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment on that, we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in orthopedics. Joe Wolk : Yes, just very quickly, Matt, thanks for the question. With respect to the restructuring program that we announced specifically in orthopedics, we're looking to exit those less profitable markets and product lines. So we'll have some clearly inventory write-downs as a result of that. Over the next two years, there will be some modest revenue disruption, but we actually do think these actions not only accelerate growth going forward, but will improve profitability. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Great. Thank you very much. Can you provide us with some insight into updates on the TALC litigation process? And then secondly, if you could just comment, Joe, you used the word voracious last time with your appetite for business development opportunities. How does that word stand still in terms of your appetite on the floor? Thank you. Joe Wolk : Hey, so Eric, why don't I turn it over to you to discuss the TALC litigation matter and then I'll come back and answer Chris's second question. Erik Haas : Great. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient developments and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about TALC. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal through to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants. Also, thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the third circuit, bypassing the district court, because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would material advance the progress of the case and we fully agree with that assessment. The appeal challenges both the validity, as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the third circuit that requires a showing of, \u201cimmediate financial distress\u201d to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the third circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the bankruptcy code and is contrary to the standards that are implied -- employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of TALC claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing, the third circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not. If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 timeframe. And because we do anticipate the third circuit will primarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the third circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the cert petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024, but if not, we will raise it in the second term. Working with the council, representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants more than we had previously that were along with us. Along with the -- in addition to the future claims representatives and together with the council and the future claims representatives were pursuing a consensual resolution of the TALC claims through another bankruptcy. And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey bankruptcy court urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to-date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong, the consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next six months to determine whether the requisite super majority of claimants support the plan. Third, while those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless TALC claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's appellate court in the Barden case reversing a $223 million verdict against the company. The appellate court reversed because it determined the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific, and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to-date. In terms of timing of the litigation, there are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place which occurs in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort plaintiff's bar and its experts with their own affirmative litigation. We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our TALC products with publications premised unknowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward. They've been fully briefed with respect to the initial case motions and in terms of timing, we expect a ruling shortly from the Federal District Court in New Jersey, whether those matters may proceed to the discovery phase. So that's a quick summary. I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have regarding the strategy. Joe Wolk : Great. Thank you, Eric. Chris, regarding your second question, you know, if J&J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in webster's where having a very eager approach to an activity is the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So I could have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, my predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines. And the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities, or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensal with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by, then make a bad deal. And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, give it our credit rating, as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller, earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it\u2019d be the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines, we are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully that answers your question. Next question, Kevin? Operator : Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I'll stick with one. So on CARVYKTI, can you talk about the commercial backdrop, just with respect to new centers or prescribers and related on manufacturing? You guys have any update on the vector constraints and maybe when that could be relieved? Thank you so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Geoff. And as you have seen in the progression quarter-over-quarter of CARVYKTI, we continue to have on one hand strong demand and on the other hand, progress in our manufacturing. We're also very encouraged by the data that came out with CARTITUDE-4 that eventually we make CARVYKTI also a medicine in early absence of therapy. So when it comes to our manufacturing progress, I'm going to let John explain what are we doing in order to be able to supply the strong demand that we are seeing in CARVYKTI today. Overall, what you can expect, Geoff, is that we -- you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in 2023 into also 2024. John Reed : Yes, to follow up on Joaquin\u2019s comments, we've been progressively adding more and more capacity. That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe, in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component, and there we've made really outstanding progress in-house, mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate limiting aspects. So altogether the capacity continues to ramp up and we continue to perfect the technology I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy and we're also making progress on the number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really, that best-in-class CAR therapy, the CARTITUDE-4 data as you know, showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one and done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%. So this is really, I think, now emerging as the preferred second line therapy. And we hope to do more such as bringing the front line as a possible alternative to stem cell transplant. Joaquin Duato : And, you know, Geoff, to your point, in multiple myeloma new product launches, we are also very encouraged by the launch of TECVAYLI and also the recent appointment of TALVEY. The progression of these medicines is exceeding our internal expectations and we already have about 2,000 healthcare professionals in the U.S. that are REM certified to be able to administer TECVAYLI and TALVEY. So very encouraging progress in these two medicines in multiple myeloma. And we expect to be able to break out TECVAYLI sales beginning in 2024. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to ask on STELARA and the biosimilar competition in the U.S. now expected in 2025. That's not new news, but I wanted to check in on how beneficial is the extra year for the innovative medicine and businesses defense strategy. I guess focusing on just the potential for TREMFYA to take share from STELARA and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease indications? And does this time make sure you provide more confidence and potential to hit the constant currency revenue target set for 2025 for the pharma unit? Thanks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you for the question. Certainly we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there, the first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, UPTRAVI, our long-acting injectables, and especially DARZALEX, we continues to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI, the progression of SPRAVATO, and also the recent launches too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline. Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first line in EGFR mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in our ESMO and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us in two existing products. We will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis for a potential approval later in 2024, that\u2019s going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA, take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales. So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA, as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We also, you know, we're also going to be able to present some data of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our innovative medicine group into the second-half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I described, but also the strength of our pipeline both in immunology, in oncology, and in neuroscience profiles us as a strong company, as a strong growth profile into the second-half of the decade. And that's part of what we will be looking forward to discussing with you in our upcoming enterprise with review, focusing on what is going to be the growth profile in the second-half of the decade. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe Joe, just a little bit more color on 2024. Appreciate the details you provided. Seems like a year of another healthy top line growth. But can you just give us some directional color on margins next year? I know there are some dis-synergies with Kenvue this year. I was trying to get a sense of how you think about margin progression here as you kind of balance some of these, you know, kind of, the pipeline opportunities and some of these top line growth initiatives versus, kind of, dropping that to the bottom line. So if there's any directional color, it would be appreciated. Thanks. Joe Wolk : Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone, is it directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization, who really took the opportunity to look at our infrastructure as a two segment company versus a three segment company. So dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024. I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year. Again, it's going depend on the investments that the R&D teams from both MedTech and Innovative Medicines can bring forth, and we'll obviously look to accelerate bringing some of these great products to patients sooner if we have that opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, just -- could you just clarify what you meant by flat procedures in \u201824 MedTech? Are you assuming, does that mean flat MedTech growth? And just for my question, can you talk about what you're seeing with bariatrics, if for GLP-1s this is, and how you're thinking about the potential impact of GLP-1s across your device business, you know, long-term, you know, especially in Cardio and Ortho. Thank you. Joe Wolk : So I'll give the second half of that question to Joaquin, but thanks for the clarifying question with respect to market growth. We are not suggesting flat market, or a flat market in MedTech next year. What we do is, are foreseeing right now, based on what we know today, is the elevated levels, the market overall being 5% to 7% versus what traditionally has been maybe 4% to 6%. We see that same 5% to 7% next year. Joaquin? Joaquin Duato : Thank you, and thank you Larry. And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a standalone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech is 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also, but our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later. For example, you know, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which at times has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short-term. Some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what they see is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s, and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road, given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment, and many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating this medication. So they would be another funnel for our bariatric business. In the rest of our MedTech business, at this point, we continue to see robust procedure increase and we don't anticipate that change, that thing -- that trend changing in the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, John, on Nipocalimab in RA. I know we're going to see the full data here at ACR, but is this a drug that you see potentially working in a broad population or is there a biomarker subset group that's more likely to respond? And then how are you thinking about Phase 3 plans here in this indication? Thank you. John Reed : Yes, thanks for the question and we look forward to sharing those data at the ACR in November in San Diego. We're looking at Nipo as either a monotherapy combined with a precision medicine strategy or as a combination for a broad population where we aim to combine with an anti-TNF agent. We see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of auto antibodies with Nipo and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. The so-called DAISY study, the Phase 2, is underway now and we'll test that combination. So that in general has been the way we're looking at RA, not only for Nipo, but other agents in our pipeline where we see the future being monotherapies that are targeted in a precision medicine way or broad therapies that are combos that can bring together synergistic mechanisms in a safe way. We're excited to be launching the DAISY program to look at that combo. And we're hoping that that will bring deeper, more durable remissions for patients as we bring those new mechanisms together. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Is it possible to give us a little bit more detail on a couple of things? You mentioned headwinds from VBP and I'm just curious if there's, A, way to quantify it; and B, a way to say if it's at least better or worse or the same as it has been the last couple of quarters? And then similarly in other aspects of China, we've been hearing a lot about anti-corruption policies, et cetera. If you could comment on that, that would be great. Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Joanne. And first, let me say that China for us is a key market, and a market in which we are delivering growth now, and we are going to continue to deliver a strong growth into 2024. So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients. So there are a number of MedTech platforms now currently undergoing VBP headwinds, electrophysiology, spine, trauma, endocutters and energy, and these effects will last during 2023 and part of 2024. We have already anniversary our large joins VBP. So at this point, we have about 80% of our platforms that have been already affected by VBP. Again, as we look into 2024, we expect to continue to deliver a strong growth in China, and China remaining a key part of our growth. When it comes to the question that you were asking in anti-corruption side, we have a strong culture of compliance in our business. And at this point, we may see some limitations related to physician and surgeon access, but we are not seeing any material impact in any part of our business due to that, and we'll continue to monitor the situation. Overall, as I said, we continue to see China as a key driver of our growth and also as a key source of innovation moving into the future. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to maybe dive a little deeper on the immunology side. Appreciate some of the comments you made there already with -- for the quarter, the performance was very strong for several of your products there? So I'm just curious if there were any sort of one-time items there that we should be aware of. It's under like there's a lot of patient mix and market growth that you are commenting on? I'm curious if you can just highlight any sort of stocking or sort of one-time pricing adjustments that we should take into account as we look at future quarters? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business, especially we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as an analog. In the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA. So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points. So you should take that into consideration when you think about the STELARA growth. We are very pleased overall, as I said, with our immunology portfolio. Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA as I recall, but also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon that we already presented data in psoriasis. And also, we have the combination of [Technical Difficulty] and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking result, so very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second-half of the decade more to be seen in our EBR later in the year. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Ahmet, I wanted to actually bring you into the conversation here and ask about some of the innovation in MedTech and specifically, you guys have an Ottava Day coming up. And just curious what you can say about, a, what we get to see, obviously, appreciating you're not going to totally open the kimono and front run the day? But b, and probably most importantly, sort of, where you see Ottava ultimately fitting into the robotics landscape and helping contribute to a continued move higher robotics penetration? Thanks so much. Ahmet Tezel : So first of all, thank you for the question. Similar to John, this is my first call as well. So really excited to be here, equally excited to be leading a team of talented scientists, engineers and physicians as we do smarter less invasive and more personalized solutions for our patients. So with respect to Ottava, we have made great progress on the platform. The team is really focused on combining a really differentiated architecture based on its software and hardware together with our best-in-class instruments, and we believe that combination of a differentiated architecture with instruments is going to enable us to have high value from day one. Now we will have more updates on Ottava next month, as you mentioned. And at that time, we will provide a lot more detail. But the one point I'll make is that even today, robotic-assisted surgery penetration is in single-digits. So there's still a lot of growth left in that segment. And we're really excited because Ottava brings a lot of differentiation. So we're very excited that we can make a big kind of path. We can open our path and growth there in that segment as well. Joaquin Duato : Danielle, if I may interject here on Ottava. I've been in touch with multiple surgeons around the world. And one common comment that I find is that they all want. They are rooting for Johnson & Johnson to come into the robotic surgical space. They want to have the service and the support that they have accustomed doing decades with our Ethicon business and they also want to be able to utilize the advanced instruments with whom they have grown. So what I see in the surgical space is that the surgeons want to have alternatives and they are all looking forward to having Johnson & Johnson play an important role in robotic surgery. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Danielle. We have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you on the FLORA 2 results, if they impacted at all your thinking on your market opportunity for MARIPOSA and why or why not? Thank you. Ahmet Tezel : No, I don't think it influences because it's really important to pay attention not only to progression-free survival, but also overall survival as well as the PFS-2 the survival in the second line of therapy. Unfortunately, with today's therapies, almost all lung cancer patients will eventually relapse. They will need a second line therapy. And we think chemo was best reserved for that circumstance where the patient now has failed the frontline targeted therapies. So I would really say, pay attention to overall survival, pay attention to that progression free survival to endpoint, because these are going to be, I think, really things that matter in terms of what the long-term outcome is for patients with EGF receptor mutant lung cancer. The -- we believe based on the data we'll present in the Presidential session at ESMO that the combination of RYBREVANT are bispecific antibody, the first bispecific ever approved for a solid tumor indication in elderly human as well as the third-generation small molecule oral EGF receptor Lazertinib, which is brain penetrant over mine. We believe that, that will become the new frontline standard-of-care for EGF receptor mutant lung cancer and offer patients durable remissions that are achieved in a chemo-free regimen. Operator : Thank you. Jessica Moore : Thank you, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. I'm proud to present today the company's performance. This is the first quarter that we report as a new J&J, focused in health care innovation, in MedTech and in Pharmaceuticals. And I believe this new J&J has a better foundation to continue to drive growth for the next decade. We are achieving strong results in 2023 with our 7.5% adjusted operational growth in the quarter. It's the second quarter in a row that we have a beat and a risk of our guidance. And we continue to believe that we're going to have a very strong finish into 2023 and that reads well for a strong 2024, too. We have a dedicated team both in Innovative Medicines and in MedTech. And we think we are very well positioned, as I said, to carry the momentum that you are seeing in 2023 into 2024. Finally, we are looking forward to engaging all of you at Enterprise Business Review on December 5th. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson in becoming a two sector company focused on innovative medicine at MedTech, we strengthened our position as an innovation powerhouse. We breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we share at our Enterprise Business Review, we have a stronger growth margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with innovative medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5% at MedTech adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine. For the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readout for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI, in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. DARZALEX in front-line multi myeloma transplant eligible patients. RYBREVANT, in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally TREMFYA monotherapy in Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 readout for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we initiated our Phase 3 clinical development programs for Milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for Milvexian in Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Acute Coronary Syndrome. And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline. Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first-time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales, as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The true pulse generator has received approval in the EU and we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO Catheter Q-FFICIENCY Study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition. Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our Enterprise Business Review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy (ph) stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's Disease and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals. In electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Joaquin. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflects the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the U.S. and 2.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 2.1% outside the U.S. It is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%. For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the U.S. and 3.4% outside the U.S. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally. Net earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4% with growth of 9.5% in the U.S. and a decline of 3.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and U.S. sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the U.S. was 9.4%. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively. This growth was driven by market growth and share gains as well as favorable patient mix in TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other Oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures and a loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE and PREZISTA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4% with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth. Growth in the U.S. was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision. Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2% with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume based procurement in China, primarily in Endocutters. Orthopaedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, as well as lapping of prior year China\u2019s VBP price concessions in Spine. Growth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS EYHANCE, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by U.S. stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit cost in Innovative Medicine. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $4.5 billion or 20.9% of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion or 24.5% of sales in Innovative Medicine with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially offset by portfolio prioritization. In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion or 14.6% of sales with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The other income and expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and lower (ph) COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 U.S. tax audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense. MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5% primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward. As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders. Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers : first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets; second, expanding our reach and scale around the world; and third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year. Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets. Regarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S. based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Spine and Trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. With my one question, I'm curious why you're looking for 2024 procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels and your expectations for how long that will last? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart (ph) recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in Vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally and while we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into at least the first half of 2024. Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We file already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the [indiscernible], in Energy and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radio frequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our Enterprise Business Review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two-part for me on CARVYKTI. I noticed an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4? And then the second part of the question is I know in manufacturing, you've been ramping up in Belgium, and I believe that facility is now up and running. So how should we think about supply for 2024 broadly for CARVYKTI? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Terence. So with more than 2,000 patients treated CARVYKTI, it's already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall and we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in two things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that is being studied and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion plus asset at peak year sales. Regarding the ODAC that you commented, we are very confident on the data of our Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study that as a reminder, support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this in immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI. Regarding your manufacturing question, we've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023. We are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and additions site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility. So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats to -- a nice finish to the year here. Joe or Joaquin, I'd love to hear just a general update on your M&A appetite and expand on your recent comments about Abiomed being a gateway in cardiovascular devices, which you, Joaquin, commented on earlier this month? Thanks so much for taking the question. Joseph Wolk : Yeah. So Larry, let me start, good morning, and then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights, a familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is, we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. And look, talking about that, Larry, let me say, we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic cut-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy. So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicine in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of Vision. So overall, that\u2019s our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe\u2019s point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just, Joe a question for you. How should we think about gross margins in 2024 and beyond? I know you talked about operating margins, but it did seem like adjusted gross margins came down in 4Q. And I'm just wondering, if that's a one-off result or a longer-term trend when you think about -- as we think about kind of the cadence of your P&L over the next few years? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Yeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say two-thirds of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024. We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you so much. I was just wondering, if we could get your latest thoughts on the potential impact of Novo's osteoarthritis data on orthopedic utilization, given the focus on WOMAC or pain scores. I believe the presentation could be here soon. Just curious to hear your thoughts and also what kind of scores could or may not have a potential impact? Thank you for taking the question. Joaquin Duato : So overall, look, osteoarthritis is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory. Specifically we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS robotic system for total knee replacement. We have already have 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers. We are working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS unique knee application. And we are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with a combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE and VELYS hip navigation. So we feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we love also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. So very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business. Joseph Wolk : And Shagun, it's also important to maybe provide us a reminder what we commented to last quarter, and that's -- we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit, so being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.. So just maybe an area we don't spend as much time on is on the respiratory side, specifically, PAH. But just sort of a two-part question, but that franchise of yours continue to sort of outperform expectations. So curious, if you can talk about sort of what's driving success there? There's also an area where you don't have a lot of sort of longer-term investment. So going back to sort of the business development question, I'm just curious in your interest in sort of PAH or respiratory more generally as an area, further focus given your key franchises are going to be going away, but you do have the infrastructure there already? Joaquin Duato : So first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high-teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark will be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. But overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023. And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and Tadalafil (ph) become standard of care clearly established in this area. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I just wanted to ask you with respect to your oncology franchise. Do you have any thoughts on CAR-Ts for autoimmune disease at all? And then secondly, radiopharmaceutical? Joaquin Duato : So thank you, Louise and we have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase 3 studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the three indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well [Technical Difficulty] with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes, but it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotics for a radio enhancer that this still been developing head and neck cancer. We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancing, and we\u2019ll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology. And it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. And I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were patient mix. Would love to get an idea of maybe kind of in the middle of the P&L and the operating line in terms of margin progression throughout the year, which ones of those of your business lines being kind of more reflecting that negative mix that you described and how that progresses during the year? Thanks. Joseph Wolk : Yeah, Matt. I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Geoff Meacham : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just wanted to ask you about the XARELTO patient mix that you guys called out. Just help us with kind of current dynamics and maybe looking forward whether this trend you expect to continue? Thank you. Jessica Moore : Yeah, Geoff. I can answer that one. So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter, we would say there's two items. It's patient mix, but there is also a one-time entry. Moving forward in 2024, we do expect that there will be a decline but not to the extent that you saw in Q4. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And I was just hoping maybe you could bridge us a little bit more. Is there any component of that is sort of price increases taken in late '22 into '23 rolling off or anything that you would highlight there? Thanks so much. Joseph Wolk : No, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impact, so out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call. Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there\u2019s nothing that happened \u2013 maybe this is the best way to state it. There\u2019s nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for all of the details today. So notwithstanding the recently announced Ambrx acquisition, in recent years, J&J has executed more MedTech M&A than pharma M&A. And I don't mean to belabor the point, I know that you got some specific therapeutic area questions. But could you just comment at a high level on what has held J&J back in pharma M&A in recent years and whether we should expect greater cash deployment to accelerate long-term pharma revenue growth going forward? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : So thank you, David. And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CNBG now called AbelZeta (ph) in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported. But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that\u2019s been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process. Jessica Moore : Thank you, David. We have time for one last question. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : All right. Good morning. Thanks you. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on your electrophysiology comments. You had an extraordinary quarter. I'm guessing the new products helped. Maybe you could give us a little more color on maybe quantify the impact -- the negative impact from China VBP? And looking ahead, we've got not -- we've got one PFA device approved in U.S., another one seemingly coming in the next month or three maybe. How should we think about the EP franchise as we look ahead to '24? What are you incorporating in your thinking? Thank you so much. Joaquin Duato : So thank you for the question. Great, and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia-Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China. The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radio frequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results. So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow. For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from day 1 fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan. We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active, three of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in \u201823 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of health care innovation. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Hello everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the first quarter business results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder you can find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda I will start by reviewing the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato our Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our first quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased 3.9% with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.20 versus basic loss per share of $0.19 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.71, representing increases of 3.8% and 12.4%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2023. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.6 billion increased 2.5%, with growth of 8.4% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.3%, both worldwide and outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continued to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21%, primarily driven by share gains of six points across all lines of therapy and ten points in the front line setting. As of this quarter, we are now disclosing TECVAYLI sales, which were previously reported in other oncology. Sales achieved $133 million in the quarter, compared to $63 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $157 million, compared to $72 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continued to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth with acceleration in the back half of the year. Other oncology growth was driven by continuing strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Also in oncology, ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 28.4%, primarily driven by share gains. Growth of 22.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. As a reminder, favorable patient mix was a driver in Q2 2023 through Q1 2024. Therefore, while we still anticipate growth, we expect to lap this dynamic beginning in Q2 2024. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 27.6%, driven by market growth and share gains. STELARA growth of 1.1% was driven by market growth and share gains in IBD, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in the U.S. and as expected, share loss in PSO and PSA. We anticipate continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry. In neuroscience SPRAVATO growth of 72% continues to be driven by share gains and additional market launches. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, which we anticipate continuing throughout the year, as well as a decrease in IMBRUVICA due to competitive pressures, partially offset by stocking dynamics in the U.S. Finally, it is worth noting distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide Med1ech sales of $7.8 billion increased 6.3%, with growth in the U.S. of 6.6% and 6.1% outside of the U.S. In the quarter, worldwide MedTech growth was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting orthopedics. In cardiovascular previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9%, with strong growth in all regions. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution, and a onetime inventory build in Asia-Pacific, impacting worldwide growth by approximately 370 basis points. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15%, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Orthopedics growth of 4.8% includes a onetime revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the U.S. positively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 300 basis points. As a reminder, orthopedics was over indexed by the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by procedure recovery, growth of new products, and commercial execution. While trauma and spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures and core trauma was further impacted by weather related softness in the U.S. Growth of 1.9% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our bio surgery and wound closure portfolios, partially offset by competitive pressures in China volume based procurement and energy and endo cutters. Contact lenses declined 2.3%, driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, partially offset by strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-day family of products. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3 2023. Surgical Vision grew 1.1%, driven by CNIS EYHANCE, a monofocal intraocular lens partially offset by China's VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin leveraged by 160 basis points, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 supply network related exit cost. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 110 basis points, driven primarily by timing of marketing investment in the Innovative Medicine business. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels investing $3.5 billion, or 16.6% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.9 billion, or 21.4% of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by continued pipeline progression. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.6 billion, or 8.3% of sales, a slight decrease driven by phasing. Interest income was $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $14 million of expense in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in income was driven by a lower average debt balance and higher interest rates earned on cash balances. Other income and expense was income of $322 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $6.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.9% versus 61.8% in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the tax benefit on the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2024 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, primarily driven by an increase in non-allocated interest income with both Innovative Medicine and MedTech margins remaining relatively flat year-over-year. When comparing against the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Innovative Medicine and MedTech adjusted income before tax margins have improved. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe. Joseph J. Wolk: Thank you, Jessica. Hello, everyone. As you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones. Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with oncology, in multiple myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for CARVYKTI for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting. We also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for TECVAYLI, the only approved BCMA targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for DARZALEX-based quadruplet therapy and were granted U.S. priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. The approval was based on data from the Phase III PAPILLON Study. We also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa Study. Turning to our immunology portfolio, we submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA seeking approval for TREMFYA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the Phase 3 QUASAR Study evaluating TREMFYA in patients with ulcerative colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May. We also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts including positive top-line results from the Frontier 2 study demonstrating JNJ2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive topline results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in adults with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants. Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for ERLEADA in localized prostate cancer as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 results for our combination therapy JNJ4804 in psoriatic arthritis as well as pivotal data from TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase 3 TREMFYA Crohn's disease data as well as our Sub-Q data for RYBREVANT at upcoming medical meetings. In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter includes significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for VARIPULSE based on the 12-month INSPIRE Study which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for U.S. approval of VARIPULSE based on the ADMIRE Study which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year. We also submitted a CE Mark filing for our Dual Energy Smart Touch SF Catheter, which will provide physicians the optionality for RF and PFA energy sources in one catheter. We began enrollment of patients in a pivotal trial evaluating Laminar's left atrial appendage elimination device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the late-breaking DanGer Shock Study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed routine use of Abiomed\u2019s Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with STEMI cardiogenic shock reduced 180-day mortality by 12.7%. In vision we launched TECNIS PURE C, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in EMEA. We also presented new data for our presbyope correcting IOL, TECNIS Odyssey at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology pipeline with the full U.S. market release of the QDOT microcatheter, the U.S. commercial launch of Abiomed Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Otava [ph] in the second half of 2024. Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended the first quarter with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the first quarter of approximately $3 billion. This was above the first quarter of 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow. Also in the first quarter of 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities. Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During the first quarter, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 4.2% increase marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. As we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Technologies in high-growth markets as well as a robust pipeline. I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by midyear 2024 at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing costs. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoint for our full year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance. As such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% or $88.7 billion to $89.1 billion increasing the midpoint by $300 million or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full year foreign currency impact of $700 million resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance. We are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items, we are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million. We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance from $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact. We anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half given the anticipated entry of STELARA Biosimilars in Europe midyear. For MedTech we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments to deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate before turning to your questions that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients. I'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John and Tim for the Q&A and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part on myeloma. First, on CARVYKTI, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the phasing comments that impacted sales in the quarter? And then secondly, on TECVAYLI, how should we think about growth for this product, it looks like it's been somewhat flattish over the last couple of quarters, but just wondering if TALVEY had an impact there, so as we think about those franchises back half of this year, maybe you could provide high-level commentary? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Terence, for your question. And before we go into the specifics of your question on CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our multiple myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade. In Innovative Medicines, DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA all grew over 20% and specifically on TREMFYA, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic indications than we do with STELARA and we have high expectations for the brand with ulcerative colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches, SPRAVATO, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, CARVYKTI with CARVYKTI just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second line setting. Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated a strong performance across cardiovascular, in electrophysiology and Abiomed and we have made significant progress with our PSA portfolio. We also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year closing the Ambrx acquisition and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It is a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024. And it also the sustained progress gives us -- give me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson, now to Jennifer on your question, Terence, on CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Jennifer L. Taubert: Thanks, Joaquin. Hello Terence and good morning everybody. Just also a quick shout out and a big thanks to our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world, delivering 8.3% adjusted operational growth, definitely above-market growth for the quarter, with strength being really across our core launch, our core and launch brands, nine brands achieving double-digit growth, 10 actually, if you include TALVEY in that mix. A strong pipeline progress that Joaquin noted and also the announcement and closing of our acquisition of Ambrx really to add another key pipeline asset for us as well as key technology that can help us in ADCs. So really strong quarter all the way around. With respect to your question specifically in multiple myeloma and then CARVYKTI and TALVEY, multiple myeloma continues to be a true stronghold for us, and we had significant performance and growth across the board in those assets during the quarter. I can start off real quickly with DARZALEX with 21% growth, predominantly with that growth coming in the frontline setting and also it was noted that [indiscernible] data has been filed, which will offer us an additional expansion in frontline. For CARVYKTI, we had over 100% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, very, very strong demand. We did have both the ADCOM in the United States, which results in an unanimous recommendation for approval and then the subsequent to the end of the quarter, approval of CARVYKTI for that line two plus which we think bodes very well. I know there's always questions on how are we doing and where we're expanding our capacity, given the strength of the data and the additional data that's coming through in indications. I'm real happy to say we have doubled our manufacturing capacity since the beginning of 2023 for cell processing. We are continuing to work on our Gant [ph] facility to have that as a secondary source of supply. We brought on some contract manufacturers, and we have completely transformed and expanded antivirus production so that, that's not a rate-limiting step for us. So I know we were a flat -- roughly flat quarter-to-quarter from 4Q to 1Q as noted, that really just was some phasing and timing of orders and when they were actually delivered and built for nothing that -- anything to really see there. We do anticipate continued growth for this asset, particularly second half versus the first half as we continue to add more slots and expand our capacity. And based on the data and everything that we're seeing, we've continued to have a lot of optimism for how CARVYKTI is performing. Likewise, as it relates to TECVAYLI, the TECVAYLI launch is going very well around the world. Consistently, we're seeing very strong uptake and rapid adoption, whether we're in the U.S., Germany, Austria, France, the major markets that have launched to date and really as the first and we believe best-in-class off-the-shelf BCMA bispecific, we really believe that, that therapy is offering deep and durable responses. And so a lot of optimism for continuing to drive the launch there. The product is performing well in the later line settings and is also performing very well from a competitive standpoint. And last but not least is actually TALVEY, which is our 10th product with double-digit growth, although that falls in the all other oncology categories. So we're not fully breaking that out yet. But very, very strong uptake as the first in GPRC5D off-the-shelf by bispecific as well. So I think what this really means is we have got fabulous opportunities across lines of therapy with what we believe are truly best-in-class agents and many of these agents have potential as well to be combined as we work towards curing multiple myeloma. So a significant business for us, and I'm very positive on our outlook for the rest of the year and going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A question for Tim. Your MedTech business grew 6.5% on an adjusted operational basis in Q1, but there were a number of onetime items. What was the net impact from those onetime items in your view and what are you seeing around the world from a procedure standpoint and what are your expectations for the rest of the year? Thank you. Timothy Schmid : Well, thank you for the question, Larry. And let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. And I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter. Now Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. And to put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance. There has been some noise specifically in relation to our Vision business. But please rest assured, we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our Vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year. There has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year. But once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 bps of selling days and then a revenue recognition change within our orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter Larry, and we remain very committed to strong high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024. Thank you. Joseph J. Wolk: Larry, I just want to maybe add on to Tim's good comments there. The one timers, there was tailwinds and headwinds in that number. So the 6.3% that you're seeing is 6.5% is pretty much a true number when you consider both sides of the equation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. Christopher Schott : Great, thanks so much for the question. I think BD type question here. I guess following the Shockwave acquisition, what's the appetite, I guess, for further away, maybe talk about like larger tuck-in type transactions either in your MedTech or Pharma business. It just seems like the portfolio and the pipeline at J&J has evolved pretty nicely over the past few years and I'm interested if you think the business is now at a point where we can think about maybe smaller earlier-stage assets as the primary focus for BD or do you still have a greater sense of urgency either in MedTech or pharma to add some of these kind of bolt-on type transactions going forward? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Chris, and this is Joaquin. I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term. So it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined and M&A, it's going to be -- remain a critical component of that. And it's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned. And what we have done so far is a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave, all of them are good examples of our study consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care. That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact, which is positive. Number two, does it -- is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house. We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions. Number three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market. And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders. So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value. I am glad that you recognize the consistency that we have deployed, and it's not going to change looking into the future. When we think about M&A, we think in decades, we don't think opportunistically. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Can you maybe circle back to Vision Care, please and can we unpack the different parts that are positive and negatives on the IO and the contact lens business? Thank you. Joaquin Duato : Of course, Joanne and thank you for bringing this up because it does look odd and certainly isn't consistent with our expectations or the performance that we expect going forward from that business. As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single-digit. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our Vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of U.S. distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory. We've now started to see that as our supply for contact lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today. As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users, while at the same time, protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year. Specifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently a market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia Pac and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier by the limited market release of our TECNIS PURE C and Odyssey next-gen multifocals and we'll see a full release occurred through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for Vision for 2024. Thank you Joanne. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Great, thank you very much. Good morning. If I could ask about the Pulmonary Hypertension business. This quarter, quite strong. You mentioned, in particular, share gains and favorable patient mix, if you could help us understand that a little bit better? And then on the forward, the pulmonary arterial hypertension segment is anticipated to see some disruption with the introduction of the recently approved product from [indiscernible]. Can you comment on what you're thinking the portfolio will perform and how that market will respond to this anticipated shift? Thank you. Jennifer L. Taubert: Hi Chris, it's Jennifer. So yes, we're really pleased with our Pulmonary Hypertension results for the first quarter with both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, delivering strong growth that was both volume and share gains in the market as well as some favorable patient mix and really rounding out a year of favorable patient mix. That last piece we don't see continuing to go forward to the same degree. But the products are performing very well for patients with PAH. Importantly, in the quarter, we got approval for OPSYNVI, which is the first combination tablet of PDE5 and an ERA. This is in line with guidelines. It's really once a patient is diagnosed really the right first choice for them is to start them on combination therapy. And so we think that this is an important introduction. And as we take a look at our portfolio and even despite other new competitors that are coming in, we do believe with OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, they have got very strong usage and both with the launch of OPSYNVI as well as what we have, that these will continue to be really productive assets and a good therapeutic area for us. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Tim, if I could just follow up on MedTech and specifically orthopedics and appreciate the onetime revenue recognition, not sure you can provide any color on exactly what changed there. But also, you talked about consistent MedTech growth going forward. I mean taking -- backing that out, you get to sort of 3% U.S. orthopedic sales growth. Is that the right way to think about that specific segment going forward or am I missing some onetime tailwinds, maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for ortho given what you guys put up this quarter? Thanks so much. Timothy Schmid : Thank you, Danielle. Firstly, we are operating in a very robust market. As we communicated in the fourth quarter of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least to the first half of 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a onetime change in revenue recognition timing. And this is only related to our U.S. business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points. Now keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our ortho business by 80 bps. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better and specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in the first quarter and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform. We're now within two years in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia Pac through the remainder of the year. And so I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Charles Young : This is Charlie Yang for Geoff. I have two questions, please. I know there's recent news regarding the INVEGA SUSTENNA Calpal [ph] litigation. Can you just tell us about kind of what we should kind of think about in terms of the potential kind of impact or in terms of the timing of the next steps? And then second, can you just talk about the TAR [ph] bladder cancer data expectation in terms of what kind of benchmark we should expect in terms of the 1-year CR rate? Thank you. Jennifer L. Taubert: Perfect. I'll take the INVEGA SUSTENNA question, and I'll pass it over to my colleague, John to take the next one. So if we think about our LAI portfolio, our long-acting injectable just as a reminder for everybody, we really are leading therapies in this space with our INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA products. And we're really excited about the latest data that we have, particularly for HAFYERA, which a recent study shows that at two years, 96% patients on HAFYERA are relapse free, which is really, really striking. So as we get to the legal question, we really don't speculate on the impact of ongoing litigation. But that being said, we remain really confident about the strength of our INVEGA SUSTENNA patents, and we're going to continue to defend the intellectual property that's associated with these patents. If we're clear to go a little bit deeper, the Federal Circuit\u2019s April 1st decision did not invalidate our patent. It just remanded the case back to the New Jersey District Court, the one that had ruled in our favor originally. Likewise, there was another ruling and another case on this patent against a different company that also did go in our favor. So it's going back to the original judge that ruled in favor of the patents, and we'll have to see what comes. We don't speculate on that, but we remain really confident on the strength of our patents. John C. Reed: Yes. Thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the drug device combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly, a great unmet need and as much as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data. Those were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients, we showed at that meeting is still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide the details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data in that first indication, which is in the BCG nonresponsive patients recollect that in early bladder non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Standard care is this attenuated micro bacteria BCG. Unfortunately, fewer than half patients receive -- achieve a complete response. And the therapy is -- has tolerability problems to say the least where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR200 has been very low. So we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation. I think we remain on track for a filing early next year based on these pivotal data, and we look forward to sharing those results at that congress. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matthew Miksic : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So a follow-up maybe on some of the device trends, in particular, cardio and EP very strong in the quarter. Wondering if you could provide some color kind of geographically as to how some of the product launches have either driven overseas or competitive environment in the U.S. has affected U.S. performance so far? And then just one quick one on Ortho, if I could. Timothy Schmid : Sure, Matt. Firstly, let me start on cardio. As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio. And until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular and that being electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made. We continue to perform ahead of the deal model. And once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves. Specifically, to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20%, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA, the progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval. And while we don't control the timing, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP. Was there a specific question to Ortho? Matthew Miksic : Just a comment on Ortho generally was sort of low to mid-single digits, but in hips and knees, sounded like 9%-ish, we added back the selling day and you're at double digits is just kind of really off the chart growth, I think, in that category. And I'm just wondering should we see like some sustainability of that rate or ramping down of that rate, how can you help us think about the rest of the year, in particular, in hips and knees? Joseph J. Wolk: Well, Matt, I think it's a testament to the progress of our team but then also in building out our portfolio. We had some gaps in the past and now filling those gaps both in hips and then even more notably in knees with the launch of our VELYS robot is really what is creating the tailwind that we're enjoying today, and we do expect that to continue. Now this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter, not absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward. I will also say that the work we've done in the orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in the second quarter of 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And just to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our orthopedics business. And so a real testament to the effort of group to not only drive top line performance but also evolve the portfolio to improve margins. Thank you again Matt. Jessica Moore : Thanks, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Vamil Divan : Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe if no one is after me I will just lead into it. One, I just was curious on SPRAVATO and sort of where like very strong growth again this quarter. If you can just provide a little more context there on where the growth is coming from, what sort of practices, what that the patients are given that product to be hopefully get a sense of that trend? And then just the other question we get a lot from investors is on the drug price negotiations with Medicare on the 10 drugs that are selected for this year's program through IRA. I know you probably won\u2019t get too much into the specifics, but I'm curious if you can just share some high-level thoughts on how the progress of those discussions are going and is it sort of in line with what you expected, is there anything sort of very different from what you expected as the process plays out? Thank you. Jennifer L. Taubert: Well, thanks for the question, and thanks for asking about SPRAVATO. We continue to be really pleased with the uptake of SPRAVATO as we continue to launch that product globally. You saw that there's over 70% growth in the quarter as it continues to perform well for patients with treatment-resistant depression. And so we've got a bold outlook for SPRAVATO as we continue to launch it into more markets and as we are able to even further penetrate the existing markets that we're in into a bit more of the community setting there. In terms -- so good -- really, really good outlook. We're also just to put in a plug for neuroscience. We talk a lot about our oncology business and our immunology business. Neuroscience is also a key area for us, so SPRAVATO is a key platform. We've also got aticaprant and seltorexant coming, and we had mentioned the long-acting therapies with the INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise earlier. So back on IRA, we've been really clear that we do think that these -- the IRA\u2019s drug setting provisions are damaging to the health care innovative system. It just -- it is not something that is going to help reinforce the tremendous investments that we're making in R&D to develop the next types of treatments and cures. That being said, we do focus on patient access and are trying to make sure that our products are available to the patients who need them. And so we're working appropriately with the government and in line with the process to start going back and forth around what the ultimate price will be. So there has been a round or two of going back and forth. And so we're still in the middle of that process. I can't really provide any more details on that. What I will say is that the products that we have that are going through the process, they are not our growth drivers for the future. Those are -- they are our products that are more at end of life. And so they're not the ones that are going to be really key for us both in the coming years as well as out through the end of the decade. And what I'd love to also reinforce is that we do remain confident that we've got a clear path to achieving our $57 billion commitment that we made back in December at our Enterprise Business Review as well as from 2025 to 2030, delivering above market growth with the 5% to 7% compounded annual growth rate and with growth in every year that being 2025 as well as all of the years beyond that. So irrespective of the IRA, when I take a look at our growth drivers and how our pipeline is coming in, we feel really confident about the state of our business. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Vamil, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and Johnson & Johnson's solid first quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus and the progress in our portfolio and pipeline. Our impact across the full spectrum of health care is unique in our industry and the commercial, clinical, and capital allocation milestones achieved in Q1 reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse. One of the most significant milestones this quarter was the announcement of our planned acquisition of Shockwave that will further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular. We continue to make strong progress towards the goals that we set out at our December Enterprise Business Review, and I'm looking forward to all that we will achieve through the remainder of 2024. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference to Johnson & Johnson. Please go ahead. Jessica Moore : Hello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the second quarter business results and our full-year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder you can find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules on the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding among other things, the company\u2019s future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will start by reviewing the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation, as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will then provide some closing remarks before we open it up for questions. Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our innovative medicine and MedTech leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our second quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.4 billion for the second quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.6%, with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, sales growth was 7.2% worldwide and growth of 6.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.05 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.82, representing increases of 1.6% and 10.2%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'll now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $14.5 billion increased 7.8%, with growth of 8.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.8% worldwide and 8.7% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21.3%, primarily driven by share gains of 4.6 points across all lines of therapy and 9.4 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $186 million, with growth of 59.9%, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. TECVAYLI sales achieved $135 million in the quarter, with growth of 43.5%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed-refractory setting. Demand remained strong while sequential growth slowed due to adoption of recently approved longer-duration dosing intervals. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 32.5%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth in metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. Other oncology growth was driven by continued strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 30.7%, driven by market growth, share gains in PSO and PSA, and favorable patient mix. STELARA growth of 4.9% was driven by market growth, partially offset by net unfavorable patient mix. We continue to anticipate biosimilar entry in Europe later this month, while in the U.S., we expect continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry in 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 60.8% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 9.1% due to share gains and market growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. UPTRAVI growth of 8.1% was driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by a decline in other neuroscience, unfavorable patient mix in Xarelto and competitive pressures in IMBRUVICA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $8 billion increased 4.4%, with growth in the U.S. of 5.7% and 3.2% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive impact of 40 basis points on sales growth in the quarter. Growth was driven by commercial execution, strength of new product introductions, and continued strong procedure volume, partially offset by performance in China and competitive pressures in US distributor stocking dynamics and vision. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered a double-digit growth of 13.4% with strong growth across all regions. The performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution, partially offset by the previous one-time inventory build in Asia-Pacific from the prior quarter. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15.4%, driven by double-digit growth in all regions and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Results include $77 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave, which closed on May 31. Contact lenses adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Blink divestiture was 2.1%. Growth was driven by strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics and competitive pressures, and Japan macroeconomic pressures. The Blink divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 130 basis points. Surgical vision grew 1.2%, driven by TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens, partially offset by China VBP and refractive softness in the U.S. Surgery adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Acclarent divestiture was approximately flat. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, China VBP, prior year China recovery, EMEA tender timing across advanced surgery and supply constraints, and wound closure. This was partially offset by strength of new products. The Acclarent divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 110 basis points. Orthopedics growth of 3.3% was driven by strong performance in hips and knees, due to procedure growth, strength of new products, and EMEA tender timing in knees. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and impacts of China VBP in spine and sports. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin deleveraged by 60 basis points, primarily driven by product mix within innovative medicine and macroeconomic factors across both sectors. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.7 billion or 18.8% of sales in innovative medicine, compared to 22.2% of sales in 2023. As a reminder, last year included an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.7 billion or 9% of sales, an increase driven by continued investment in strategic platforms. Other income and expense was a net expense of $653 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to income of $384 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in expense was primarily driven by costs related to the closing of the Shockwave acquisition, the loss on the completion of the debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in Kenvue and prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements in MedTech. This was partially offset by the gain on the Acclarent divestiture. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 18.5% versus 14.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by unfavorable one-time international audit settlements and the continued impact from Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second-quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 37.2% to 37.4%. Innovative Medicine margin improved from 42.3% to 44.6%, primarily driven by an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership in 2023, partially offset by product mix and cost of products sold. MedTech margin declined from 28.2% to 25.7%, driven by prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements worth approximately 300 basis points. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jessica, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Overall, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid top and bottom-line, as well as free cash flow growth in the quarter. Our Innovative Medicine business made great progress in the second quarter. We have strong momentum with key end-market products and continue to advance our pipeline with significant clinical and regulatory milestones being attained. Our MedTech business delivered growth that fell below our expectations of growing in the upper range of our markets, which as you recall correlates to a weighted-average market growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2022 through 2027. We came into the year thinking 2024 would be in the upper end of that range. With acceleration planned in the second-half, given some of the first-half dynamics Jessica outlined, we now expect growth closer to 6% for 2024. To me, this reflects the power and breadth of our company, where we can more than offset quarterly volatility in one part with overperformance from another part of our business. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to provide some qualitative business highlights from the quarter. Starting with innovative Medicine, in oncology, we continue to make meaningful progress across our disease areas of focus. Of note, we received FDA approval for CARVYKTI in earlier lines of therapy and reported positive top-line overall survival results from the CARTITUDE-4 study. We also submitted a filing with the FDA for our subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT. We presented updated results for TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we met primary endpoints for two DARZALEX studies, Cepheus and Aquila, where results will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting. Turning to immunology, we achieved key milestones for TREMFYA in inflammatory bowel disease, including the presentation and filing of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as the filing of our subcutaneous formulation, which would make TREMFYA the only IL-23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous regimen. We also expanded our immunology portfolio with the acquisitions of Proteologix and NM26. These bispecific antibodies will further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our ability to address significant unmet need in atopic dermatitis. Finally, spanning immunology and neuroscience, we presented positive results for nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and myasthenia gravis. But it doesn't stop with the second quarter. We are excited for what awaits in the second half of this year with the anticipated approval and launch of both RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline EGFR positive lung cancer and TREMFYA in IBD. We also expect data from JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ 4804, our co-antibody therapeutic in IBD and nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. As we continue to bring new innovations to market and execute against clinical and regulatory milestones, Innovative Medicine is well-positioned to achieve sustainable growth in both the near and long-term. Turning to MedTech, we continue to advance our pipeline, launch new commercial products and integrate strategic acquisitions that broaden and further differentiate our portfolio. In cardiovascular, we are enhancing our portfolio and shifting into higher growth markets through strategic acquisitions such as Shockwave Medical. In May, we announced the launch of our CARTO 3 Version 8 electroanatomical mapping system. This is the latest version of our 3D heart mapping system, which has machine learning capabilities that increase efficiency, reproducibility, and accuracy in maps electrophysiologists use to treat atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. In pulsed field ablation, we initiated the commercial launch of the VARIPULSE platform in the EU and Japan receiving early positive physician feedback in the external evaluation period. We also delivered results from the pivotal phase of the admIRE trial, where the VARIPULSE platform demonstrated 85% peak primary effectiveness with minimal adverse events, short PFA application times and low fluoroscopy exposure. In orthopedics, we received 510(k) FDA clearance for the clinical application of the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This is designed for both medial and lateral procedures enabling surgeons to guide precise implant placement without a CT scan. In surgery, we launched the ECHELON 3000 in the U.S., which combines 3D stapling and gripping surface technology to enable greater staple line security. This has been shown to deliver 47% fewer leaks, reduce surgical risks and improve surgical outcomes. In surgical vision, we launched TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and head into a full market launch in the second-half of 2024. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology and cardiovascular pipelines as we prepare for the anticipated U.S. approval of VARIPULSE, as well as the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. Within robotic surgery, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for OTTAVA in the second-half of the year. Before turning to cash flow and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on the talc litigation. As announced on May 1, the company has committed to pay ovarian claimants a present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25-years, resulting 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against the company and its affiliates in the United States. We are currently in a voting period for the plan, where for the first time, claimants are able to vote for themselves for or against the plan. The last day of voting is scheduled for July 26. It will then take a few weeks for the vote administrator to vet and tally the votes. Once that process concludes, we plan to make a public announcement on the next steps regarding a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. Our confidence that we will reach the requisite 75% vote is bolstered by the continued support of council representing the vast majority of claimants with whom the plan was developed, as well as the announcement of support by additional prominent plaintiff law firms recently, including Ailstock, Keller Postman, and Miller. Additionally, in furtherance of our goal of achieving a comprehensive solution, we finalized the previously announced agreements reached with all states that advanced talc claims in the Imerys and Cyprus entities, owners of the mines that supplied talc to the company. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress with mesothelioma claimants with 95% of claimants now settled. Turning to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $41 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $7.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the prior year period, which included cash flow from the Consumer Health business. During the quarter, we exited our retained stake in Kenvue, bringing the separation to a close. The net proceeds from the secondary offering were $3.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We maintain a strong balance sheet, which continues to enable us to strategically invest in and grow our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. In the second quarter, we invested more than $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales in research and development. In terms of acquisitions and licensing, during the first half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $17 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities. This includes Shockwave, Proteologix and the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction announced last week, as well as more than 20 other smaller complementary business development transactions. While we will always explore strategic deals of any size that can create value, we foresee modest tuck-in deals as the preferred route over the near-term. Now turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Given the moving parts associated with the acquisitions this quarter, I'll start where I usually end with earnings per share. Before the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again being increased. As this schedule reflects, we are expecting a $0.05 per share increase in our operational performance. This would result in year-over-year EPS growth of 8.2% at the midpoint. To account for the completion of Shockwave, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody transactions, and as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.68 per share. Combined, all of this yields an updated adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of $10 to $10.10 per share. In addition to assist with your future models, these transactions are expected to have a smaller impact of $0.33 to adjusted operational EPS in 2025. Now to address all elements of P&L guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full-year by $500 million to reflect the completion of the Shockwave acquisition. We now expect growth in the range of 6.1% to 6.6% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $89.4 billion or 6.4% at the midpoint. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 5.5% to 6.0% compared to 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. We are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.08, consistent with last quarter. However, there have been notable strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, specifically the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. As a result, we estimate an incremental negative foreign currency impact of $500 million, resulting in a full-year impact of $1.2 billion. As such, combined with the Shockwave acquisition, we expect reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2%, compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Based solely on the dilution from the transactions, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by 120 basis points, more than offsetting the previously communicated 50 basis point improvement. We projected net interest income between $300 million and $400 million, lower than previous guidance driven by interest expense associated with financing of our recent acquisitions. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase versus previous guidance driven by year-to-date performance. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full-year, much higher than 2023, largely due to the impact of OECD Pillar 2, as well as the non-deductible nature of the recently announced NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. We continue to expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe beginning the last week of July. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. While we had COVID-19 vaccine sales in the second quarter, we do not anticipate any future sales. Finally, it is worth noting that distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in the fourth quarter. In preparation for this transfer, we expect limited third-quarter sales in Europe. Turning to MedTech, as previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate back in line with our long-term expectations in the second-half of the year. This will be driven by recovery in contact lenses, evidenced by sequential monthly improvement within Q2. Further expansion into high-growth segments, including the integration of Shockwave and continued growth of new products and commercial execution across the portfolio. As you think about our adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect it to be higher in the first-half of the year, compared to the second-half. Again, this is due to the IP R&D charge for the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction in Q3 as well as the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe later this month. Lastly, as a reminder on share count, we only expect a partial benefit in the third quarter resulting from the share count reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer in August of 2023 with the fourth quarter being neutral. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our differentiated portfolio and achieving key clinical and regulatory milestones across Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth and long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin for concluding remarks before taking your questions. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. With a strong second quarter, I'm excited about the rest of 2024. Our Innovative Medicine business is on track for a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth. Our success is driven by a portfolio of innovative best and first-in-class medicines, many of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Across the board, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, we are reinventing treatment paradigms and transforming lives. As Joe mentioned, we have made significant progress across our pipeline. In particular, I would like to highlight two major milestones on the horizon that will help drive sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. First, the approval and launch of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And second, the approval and launch of TREMFYA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD, which follows the recent presentation of data that demonstrated superiority versus STELARA. This represents a meaningful opportunity for TREMFYA as approximately 75% of STELARA sales today come from IBD. We also have regulatory and data milestones for many of the assets that we expect to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales. As the pipeline and portfolio progress, so too does our confidence in our near and long-term growth trajectory. We are confident in our ability to grow through the upcoming STELARA biosimilar entry and see accelerating momentum through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, year-to-date adjusted operational sales growth of 5.2% reflects continued progress with the portfolio as we move into higher growth markets. As you heard from Joe, we expect MedTech growth to accelerate in the second-half of the year. Growth will accelerate through continued expansion of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS Max 1-Day Contact Lenses, TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and VARIPULSE in Europe and Japan. Our confidence in the business outlook remains unchanged. With meaningful outcomes from the danger shock trial in Abiomed and the second quarter close of the shockwave acquisition, we look forward to continue the expansion into high-growth MedTech markets. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is laser-focused on advancing the next wave of medical innovation. We are building on a strong foundation to unlock accelerated growth with a healthy balance sheet and industry-leading investments in the best science and innovation. This enables us to move into the second-half of 2024 from a position of strength. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just a question on RYBREVANT. I know, Joaquin, you mentioned that as one of the key upcoming milestones for the company, but this does seem like a product where there's a disconnect between J&J's enthusiasm in the Street. So, maybe just enlighten us with some of the data we recently saw at ASCO on subcutaneous dosing, et cetera, the upcoming label expansion? Can you just talk about how you see RYBREVANT evolving overtime and your confidence that this product can take share in the frontline setting? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Hi, Chris, it's Jennifer and thanks so much for the question. Real quick before I get into that one, I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all my internal Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a terrific quarter. Our first $14 billion-plus quarter that we hit in over 10 products with double-digit growth. So, really, really a tremendous quarter and looking-forward to a great half of the year as well. So, we are very excited about RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib and the data that we're seeing and really believe that it's going to have a significant place in frontline non-small cell lung cancer. As we've discussed before, there is a significant unmet need in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with about a quarter of patients never even making it to second-line therapy. So, a lot of patients that are there with high unmet medical need. When we take a look at the data that we've been able to generate in terms of PFS and when you add to that, the new data that we brought forward on our subcu dosing, we think together, we're going to have a really winning combination for patients in that frontline setting. So, high unmet need, really spectacular results that we're seeing and the subcu dosing we think is going to be a great combination. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, maybe we can do a deeper dive into MedTech. Just talk about what drove the reduction in the expected growth for MedTech in 2024? And how are you thinking about the Medtech end-markets in the second half and which J&J businesses do you see improving in the second-half and why? Thank you. Tim Schmid : Larry, thank you for the question. Let me be very clear, we remain absolutely committed to delivering solid growth in the full-year for 2024. And Larry, when you actually look at \u201824 Q2, it was a tougher quarter for us. And we knew this, given the fact that at this time last year around the second quarter, we saw the opening up of the China market, which as you know is an important market for us and that was expected. That was actually by the way, last year our fastest-growing quarter. Now in all transparency, as you heard initially in the comments earlier, there have been two businesses that have or two areas of our business that have performed below expectations. Number one is Vision and secondly, our performance in China, which right now is a very volatile market. Now in Vision, we initially announced in the first quarter some challenges with distributor stocking dynamics here in the U.S., some competitive pressures, as well as some macroeconomic challenges in Japan. What gives me confidence in the turnaround of that business is that we actually saw sequential improvement through the second quarter. Some of those stocking dynamic dynamics I mentioned bled into April, but month-on-month, we saw strong rebound of that business, in fact, to the end of the quarter back to historical levels. And so as we look to the back half of the year, while it's been a slower start there, we're very confident that we're going to be able to bring that business back to historical norms, driven primarily by innovation. Our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX portfolio and that global launch as well as the addition of our premium IOLs with TECNIS PureSee in Asia-Pac and EMEA as well as Odyssey here in the U.S., and so we believe we've got that under control. When I look to the back half onto answer your question more directly, the reason we are confident is firstly, not only the return to more normalized growth within Vision, but in surgery, by the way, that -- all that business also was impacted by a slower start, especially in China. We see that starting to normalize. And also remember in our surgery business, the results were impacted by the divestiture of a Acclarent last year. And so normalized growth -- our adjusted operational growth was actually closer to flat. We see that continuing to grow at low-single-digit through the back half of the year. We're proud of the solid results in ortho and see that continuing to be driven by strong results within hip 6%, in knees, almost 10%, driven by tremendous innovation, especially in VELYS. And then more broadly, I'll end with our real confidence in the growth of our cardiovascular portfolio. And remember, Larry, that we've got an EP business that's $5 billion today, grew 21% last year, 19% for the first-half of the year. In fact, in the second quarter, in the face of competition, here in the U.S. we grew that business 16%. And so we're very confident in our ability to grow that leadership position. And then finally, the addition of Abiomed still continuing to grow ahead of our deal expectations, 15.4%. I think that's going to be bolstered by the landmark results, the first time in 25 years, where we have the DanGer Shock study showing survivability benefits of Impella, which will continue to open new markets for that portfolio. And then finally, I'll end with how delighted we are to inch very, very short order, welcome Shockwave to Johnson & Johnson. We closed that transaction in record timing and are really excited by the fact that we will shortly announce that they will be the 13th business with sales in excess of $1 billion annually. And so for all those reasons, Larry, while a tougher second year -- second quarter primarily due to comps, we remain very confident in a solid 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask you about your Phase III nipocalimab data that you presented recently. And how do you compare and contrast the efficacy and durability of your product versus other FcRns and mechanisms of actions on the market? Thank you. John Reed : Yes, John Reed here. Thanks for that question. Well, we're really excited about the data in Sjogren's with nipocalimab. It's the data we delivered shows really sustained disease control, which is so important by our dosing regimen as compared to some of the intermittent dosing regimens used by others. And the consistent efficacy we've seen across all primary, secondary endpoints, et cetera, is really compelling as a guess that we may be on the first advanced therapy for Sjogren's that disease has ever seen. As you know, that's a very prevalent disorder affecting its estimated 4 million people around the world, perhaps 1 million in the United States, 90% of the people impacted are women right in the prime of life. So, we're really excited about the possibility of bringing forward the first advanced therapy for that disorder. Jessica Moore : Maybe I can add-in a couple of things on as well because we're really excited by what we're seeing from all the data that's coming out. And over the last 18 months, we've demonstrated clinical effect in actually four auto-antibody driven diseases and we are the only FcRn blocker that's in development where we've got proof-of-concept in all three segments of auto-antibody driven diseases from rare auto-antibody to prevalent room to maternal fetal. So as we take a look at all the data that's coming forward as we're bringing this to market, we are even more confident -- in terms of confidence that this is a $5 billion-plus asset for us. Operator Our next question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now live. Rick Wise : Good morning, everybody. If I could talk a little bit about the EP business. Obviously, this is the first full quarter where we're really seeing a broader launch of a competitive PFA system. You updated us on your system. But maybe if you could give us more color broadly on the impact you're seeing on EP growth and the outlook for the second-half, and help us better understand how this launch and the lot of CARTO 3 version 8 launch is being affected here. I\u2019m assuming mapping growth was strong, but maybe -- I don't know, maybe the catheter business was pressured by the competitive system. Can you help give us that macro color and maybe the specific impact on Biosense Webster. Thank you. Tim Schmid : Of course, Rick and thank you for the question. And Rick, I'd start with firstly, recognizing that we believe that PFA is really good for electrophysiology and really good for patients. It is a tailwind for the entire market. And as I mentioned earlier, that's a $5 billion market for us today, growing 19% year-to-date. And let me be clear, we clearly see some competition, especially here in the U.S., especially between now and the time that we bring our PFA technology to market, we're confident. While we don't control the timing, we expect to have that by the end of the year or early next year. As you know, we already have and are commercializing our PFA technology in EMEA and in Japan, and we are very fortunate to actually benefit from a very global EP business. What gives us confidence in the future, Larry, is that we believe that while PFA has a role to play in the portfolio, so does RF. From everything we're hearing from EPs around the world, what they like about PFA is the relative safety of the technology, but they also like about RF, which by the way, we have 20-years of leadership in safety and clinical efficacy, is the durability of that product. In fact, even today, Rick, here in the U.S., for every five procedures where PFA is used, RF is used in conjunction. And so we believe that leisure position that we built over the last 20-years will continue, both in RF and then obviously, we're excited by the launch of our PFA technology. You'll know that at the HRS conference in May, we announced the results of our admIRE study, which showed the 86% relative effectiveness -- primary effectiveness of our PFA technology. And we are going to continue to employ the same strategy we did in RF, which is building out a broad portfolio of PFA offerings, both in dual energy, focal, large focal and single shot. Did you know that today, the number one used catheter on the market is our SPF catheter within RF. And we are -- and you'll know that in the second -- first quarter of this year, we announced a application for a CE mark for our dual energy catheter. This will be one catheter used, both for RF and PFA technology. And so we've got a lot of reasons to believe. And I think to touch on your point on CARTO, one of the benefit of our portfolios, not just our energy source and catheters, it really is the installed base of 5,500 CARTO systems around the world. We just version 8 of that software. It is best-in-class in the market. And that's also complemented by highly trained clinical specialists in every cath lab around the world who are supporting EPs each and every day. And so once again, PFA is a good thing for the marketplace, it's a tailwind and we expect to continue to benefit on that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts for me on IRA. Was just wondering if you can offer any perspective on the impact of IRA negotiation STELARA and XARELTO as we're getting close to the disclosure of the pricing decision? And then also Part D redesign in 2025, just some high-level thoughts? And the second part of the question relates to your confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO will be looked at separately than DARZALEX just given the Hyaluronidase component there. Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Thanks so much for the question. I'll answer the second part first. We do have very good confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO is treated separately than DARZALEX IV. And so yes, we continue forward with that perspective on that. In terms of IRA and kind of what's been going on, if we take a look at Part D redesign, while we're not externally quantifying the impact at this time, what we can say is that we do anticipate a net unfavorable impact in 2025. However, as outlined at our enterprise business review last November, we do anticipate, as a business, growing 3% plus next year and then 5% to 7% out through 2030. And these numbers are actually already included in that guidance that we provided. Same thing as it pertains to the government price setting process, we are still in that. We have received the final numbers from the government, we're not disclosing that at this time. That will be disclosed in the September time frame. And while we are not in alignment with IRA and the price setting process, those numbers have been included in the guidance that we provided last year at EBR, that still looks very good to us today. It's very consistent today. John Reed : Since you mentioned, DARZALEX. John Reed here, I thought maybe I would just remind you that actually, in this quarter, we delivered four additional positive Phase III studies with DARZALEX across a number of indications, including transplant ineligible frontline, including in the maintenance setting, after transplant, including smoldering condition that is as large as the entirety of diagnostically defying myeloma and in amyloidosis. So the momentum continues with DARZALEX. Jennifer Taubert : And we had 21% growth. $2.9 billion in sales and 21% growth. So yes, DARZALEX is our single largest asset now for the corporation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just touch on MedTech and outlook for procedure volume trends in the back half. There have been some concerns that there's some tough comps on the utilization side and particularly for [Technical Difficulty] half? And then maybe also, if you could just touch on the pricing environment and your outlook for device pricing and where pricing stands for the MedTech portfolio? Thanks for taking the question. Joe Wolk : Sure, Josh. And I think my answer to your sort of volume question will be very brief and consistent with what we've shared before. For the most part, across the portfolio, we've seen volumes normalize. We did mention that we expected to see some of the -- some tailwinds from the backlog within Orthopedics in the first-half of the year. And we've seen that, but we expect that to normalize in the back half. We remain consistent in our belief in the 5% to 7% growth for our end markets and that we will perform well within that. As it relates to pricing, inflation has not been a friend to our industry, and we have put a lot of effort into really ensuring that we can secure preferential pricing across the world. I do think we benefit from the global nature of our business. While there are pockets cost containment efforts that we're managing, like VBP in China, we see tremendous opportunity to really secure a premium pricing, especially where we have differentiated innovation. And especially now that we're entering or are entering is like cardiovascular of significant unmet need, there is tremendous opportunities for us to ensure that we secure premium pricing for truly differentiated innovations, especially in areas like electrophysiology, in heart recovery with Abiomed, and more recently with Shockwave. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. Dave Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. Could you please comment on the J&J U.S. pharma exposure to efforts by plans to extract greater rebates in 2025 than in typical years in order to offset Part D plan losses in 2025? Thanks very much. Jennifer Taubert : Thanks for the question on that. We're still in the process of working with all payers for the planned formularies and everything for 2025 and 2026. I think what's really most important is to go back to the guidance we provided at the EBR last year in November. And as we take a look at the corporation, we have factored in and anticipated what we think will happen. And as an organization, we feel very confident in the guidance of 3% plus growth in 2025, and really, importantly, that accelerating growth out through the end of the decade, the 5% to 7% growth. Joe Wolk : Dave, I'd also remind you too that over the last six years, and certainly a compliment to John, Jennifer and the team, that innovation really underscores the success that we've had with quarter in, quarter out performance in our Innovative Medicines business. Discounts and rebates six years ago, as compared to list price was only about 25% of that list price. Today, that number -- and this is not just the J&J number, but an industry number, gravitates towards 60%. So what we want to make sure that happens is this great innovation gets to patients and makes a difference in their lives and get them -- they have access through the discounting that we already provide. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick MedTech question on China. So China, it sounds like things are evolving in China. I mean this is no surprise to anyone. But just curious about how you guys are thinking about China as a contributor going forward given all the evolution in that market and some of the issues, VBP, things like that. How meaningful? I mean, it's been a big growth driver for you guys historically. How do we think about China going forward? And is the strategy for J&J, does it have to change to adapt to the evolving market there? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Danielle, it's Joaquin. So we were one of the first companies that started to operate in China, and we've been in China for decades. So we have a history of having constructive engagements with China, and we are looking forward for that to continue. Now we recognize the situation and we have robust business continuity planning practices in place, and we are able to mitigate any potential exposure. But we continue to see China as an important growth driver, both for our Innovative Medicine business and also for our MedTech business. Specifically, you had some questions that Tim can address on MedTech and how we see our MedTech business in China moving forward. Tim Schmid : Sure. And Danielle, we are fortunate to have a global business with more than 50% of our revenue already out of the U.S. And I think that gives us the flexibility to really manage a number of challenges that occur on a quarterly and yearly basis across the world. To Joaquin's point, we've been in China for 37-years. One of the reasons why we've been successful is our ongoing commitment in navigating multiple headwinds and opportunities. And when we look at our performance in China, remember, we had the end of COVID when we came out of lockdown, and so that has impacted the results in the second quarter. But when you look at on the ground, what's really happening is there's two factors. Firstly, you look at the impact of VBP, which is a government-driven cost containment effort. And given our leadership position in China, we are seeing that as a short-term tailwind. We do believe the volume opportunity will far offset over time the impact we're seeing on price, but that certainly is a short-term pain that we are enduring. That has also been exacerbated by the anticorruption campaign. You may know that in July of last year, the government initiated an anticorruption campaign, which actually has had an impact on both procedural volumes and engagement from health care professionals. Now I must reiterate that we see this as a really good thing. We believe that any effort on behalf of any government to really build integrity and compliance into the health system is a good thing for more fair competition and aligns with our credo and our commitment to compliance across all of the markets in which we participate in. So it's a short-term headwind, but long-term, really good for our industry and really good for J&J. We remain absolutely committed to China. And we will continue, as we always have, to navigate some of the challenges we have on the ground with pricing and geopolitical challenges, and we remain committed to the 1.4 billion patients who rely on us each and every day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. Good morning. Together with my colleague, David Roman, a genuine question that we had related to the MedTech market dynamics and outlook. Can you help us better understand comments that were made about a fair amount of inventory destocking that's been happening and juxtapose that and perhaps reconcile with your expectation that the demand outlook would strengthen. We're just trying to put together this notion of inventory stocking, destocking ahead of an anticipated acceleration versus a potential deceleration or a tougher demand environment going forward? That would be helpful. Thank you. Joe Wolk : Thank you. It's a good question and the only area across the vast businesses that we have, where we have seen a destocking is really in our contact lens business. And you'll recall in the first quarter, we mentioned that on the back of some historical supply chain challenges, the distributor inventory was reduced here in the U.S., and we've now seen that bleed into the second quarter as mentioned earlier. And so that is the only area of significant stocking that has had a short-term impact on our business. As I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is that as we look through the full second quarter, we saw sequential improvement across that portfolio. Remember that we actually serve the needs of 40 million patients. We have, by far and away, a market leadership position here in the U.S. and globally with contact lenses. And so we see this as a blip and by no means a longer impact on our ability to continue to be leaders in contact lens. Thank you. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Chris. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking the question. I'd like to wrap up with the orthopedics question. Hips and knees are growing faster than the historic rates, could you sort of unpack that a little bit and give us an idea of how much of that is patient volume, price, new products or maybe something else? And have a great day. Tim Schmid : You too, Joanne, thank you. We are so proud of, , frankly the resurgence of orthopedics, and I couldn't be more grateful for the incredible effort across the world to really return as to high solid growth across the two platforms that you referenced. Specifically within hips, and I mentioned this in the first quarter, for the first time ever, we were able to declare market leadership position in hips here in the U.S. And to be direct in answering your question, it is all innovation based. It's not only continuing to drive our best-in-class implants, but it's also how we've surrounded those with enabling like our VELYS Hip Navigation and Kenzie. That 6% growth you saw in the second quarter is really indicative our innovation working for patients. On knees, another shout out to the team, almost 10% growth. We haven't seen that historically and once again driven by innovation. In a short roughly 2.5-year period, we have launched our VELYS system for knees into more than 20 markets. We have more than 70,000 procedures, and that is driver of our performance. And what gives us confidence is that we're continuing to build indications. You may know in the second quarter, we received 510(k) approval for our VELYS Uniknee. And we also are looking to build out that portfolio. And in short order, you will see news about our commitment to really bringing robotics to other parts of the orthopedic portfolio, especially in spine. And so once again, it's all innovation driven, and we expect it to continue. Thank you. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joanne, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm proud of the progress we made through the first-half of the year. And I'm also energized as we look towards the remainder of 2024 and heading to 2025. As the only company dedicated to both medical technology and pharmaceuticals, we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of health care innovation. We are entering the second-half of the year from a position of strength, advancing our diverse portfolio and pipeline to continue bringing innovation into the patients we serve. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore : Hello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the third quarter results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will kick us off with opening remarks and highlight key catalysts within the segments. I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the enterprise, as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide an overview of our pipeline advancements, cash position, capital allocation priorities and guidance for 2024, as well as qualitative considerations for 2025. Jennifer Taubert, John Reed and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and hello, everyone. As you will hear, we delivered strong results in the third quarter with 6.3% operational sales growth. Our performance, once again, reflects the unique breadth of our business and our commitment to delivering the next wave of healthcare innovation to patients around the world. It also reflects the work we have done to shift our pipeline and portfolio to high innovation and high growth markets. That work continues, which you saw with the recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx, Proteologix and NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And we are pleased with the progress we are making. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a second consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 11 key brands growing double-digits. DARZALEX became the first product in our portfolio to reach $3 billion in sales in a single quarter. And as you will hear, our pipeline of high innovation, high growth potential assets is advancing rapidly with five major U.S. and EC approvals in the quarter. This includes FDA approval of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE as first line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer, a transformational step forward for patients, and FDA approval of TREMFYA for active ulcerative colitis, which represents a significant opportunity for Johnson & Johnson, given 75% of STELARA sales today come from inflammatory bowel disease. And with filings and reviews underway for many of our innovative medicines that have the potential to generate $5 billion in peak year sales, we are increasingly confident in our near- and long-term growth trajectory. In MedTech, you can see the impact of our portfolio shift to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, we are now category leaders in four of the largest and highest growth cardiovascular intervention medtech markets, which in Q3 translated to another quarter of double-digit growth across the Cardiovascular portfolio. And with the full market launch of Shockwave E8 peripheral IVL catheter, we are seeing an immediate impact of the Shockwave acquisition. In Vision, growth is accelerating, and we expect that to continue with the recent full market release of TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S. and ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day contact lenses. We are also excited about the future of our surgery business. As you will recall, in November 2023, we committed to submitting the OTTAVA robotic surgical system for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2024 to initiate clinical trials. I'm pleased to announce that we have met that milestone with the IDE application submitted in Q3. Looking across the enterprise, our high innovation, high growth strategy is working and our progress this quarter speaks to the strength of our commercial and innovation capabilities. We have increased adjusted operational EPS guidance pre-M&A for the third quarter in a row. We have invested $18 billion in high innovation, high growth M&A this year. Based on this quarter's results, we are confident in our expectations for 2025 through the end of the decade and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call back to Jess. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.6% in the U.S. and 4.6% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 90 basis points. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.11 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.69 a year ago. Results in the quarter were impacted by the updated talc litigation settlement proposal, as well as acquired IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.42, representing decreases of 13.3% and 9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Results were impacted by the acquired IPR&D expense of $1.25 billion or approximately 1,900 basis points associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.6 billion increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.5% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation, consistent with market practice. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 22.9%, primarily driven by share gains of 4 points across all lines of therapy, with 7.7 points of growth in the front line setting as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $286 million, with growth of 87.6%, driven by share gains, continued capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. This reflects sequential growth of 53.2% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $135 million in the quarter with growth of 21.4%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remained strong, while sequential growth was flat due to continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. We anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in other oncology. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 26.3%, primarily driven by share gains in metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer and favorable inventory dynamics. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in other oncology as we expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 14.3%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. STELARA declined 5.7%, driven by unfavorable net patient mix and share loss, partially offset by market growth. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered Europe as of July, and we anticipate U.S. biosimilar entry in January 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 55.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI grew 17.4% and 15.2%, respectively, driven by market growth, share gains and patient mix. As mentioned last quarter, REMICADE and SIMPONI realized limited sales in Europe as we prepare for the return of distribution rights in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 6.4% with growth in the U.S. of 7.8% and 5% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 270 basis points on worldwide growth, 360 basis points in the U.S. and 180 basis points outside of the U.S. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 10.7%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the U.S., as well as prior year trade inventory dynamics and VBP in China. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.3%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $229 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact lenses and other performance improved to 4.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, a one-time benefit from a change in U.S. contract shipping terms worth approximately 150 basis points, as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision grew 1.9%, driven by TECNIS PureSee and TECNIS Eyhance, partially offset by China VBP and softness in the U.S. Surgery declined 0.7%, with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 110 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. This was partially offset by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Orthopaedics growth of 1.3% was primarily driven by success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures, impacts of China VBP and revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopaedics transformation. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing nearly $5 billion or 22% of sales, which includes a $1.25 billion payment to secure the global rights to NM26 bispecific antibody. Even when excluding this investment, R&D as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales was leveraged 100 basis points, driven by the realization of optimization efforts following the Kenvue separation. Interest income was $99 million as compared to $182 million of income last year, driven by a higher net debt position primarily related to the financing impacts of the Shockwave acquisition. Other income and expense was a net expense of $1.8 billion compared to an expense of $0.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in expense was driven by a $1.75 billion charge related to the talc litigation settlement proposal, partially offset by prior year higher unrealized mark to market losses on public securities, as well as the monetization of royalty rights. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 17.4% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by the tax treatment of the NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition and OECD Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 15.6% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax [by segment] (ph). Innovative Medicine margin declined from 45.4% to 37.9%, primarily driven by the $1.25 billion acquired IPR&D expense to secure the global rights for NM26 bispecific antibody, partially offset by the monetization of royalty rights. MedTech margin declined from 24.7% to 24.1%, driven by increased R&D investment and lapping of a prior year divestiture gain, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.6% to 32.4%, with acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 560 basis points. Starting in 2025, aligned with recent FASB reporting disclosure requirements, we will begin providing additional P&L details by segment. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe. Joe Wolk : Thank you, Jessica. In the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson delivered results that illustrate not only the breadth of the business, but our ability to consistently beat financial expectations. Innovative Medicine continued to build on strong first-half revenue momentum. We are advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, achieving significant clinical and regulatory milestones across key therapeutic areas. Our MedTech business, with the addition of Shockwave, delivered operational growth of 6.4% in the quarter, but did experience headwinds in the Asia Pacific region. We continue to fortify our future advancing the OTTAVA robotic surgery system to IDE, expanding VELYS use and launching new intraocular lenses. Due to dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, we are taking a responsibly conservative approach by assuming no material improvement in that part of the business for the remainder of this year. And as such, we expect MedTech adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2024 to be closer to 5% versus the 6% we referenced last quarter. The strength of a diversified business enables us to more than offset volatility in one part of our business, but yet be in a position to once again increase 2024 guidance for the enterprise. Before diving into the results, I'll take a moment to touch on some enterprise-wide updates from the quarter. We are making progress towards resolving talc litigation. Our pre-packaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from the current claimants of roughly 83% as well as the future claimants representative. As announced last Thursday, the case will be heard in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. And while we remain committed to bringing this matter to a resolution, it would be premature to speculate on timing. In addition to the pipeline highlights Joaquin mentioned, there are some additional notable advancements throughout the quarter. In oncology, we received U.S. and EU regulatory approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy as a second line treatment for adults with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. With FDA priority review underway for a subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT, along with data supporting a treatment regimen to reduce adverse events, we are building a best-in-class EGFR portfolio. We also presented Phase 1 data for RYBREVANT with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, extending the asset's potential beyond lung cancer. In multiple myeloma, we advanced our leadership position with FDA approval and filing of two DARZALEX FASPRO quad-based regimens for newly diagnosed patients. With CARVYKTI, we announced three-year follow-up data showing significantly extended overall survival and gained approval for commercial production at our Ghent facility, further expanding supply capacity. Finally, in oncology, we added to the growing evidence base for our TARIS platform with positive Phase 2b data in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and positive interim to Phase 2 data in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. In neuroscience, we submitted to the U.S. and European regulatory bodies for what would be the first global approval of nipocalimab for the treatment of people living with generalized myasthenia gravis. For the remainder of the year, we expect approval of TREMFYA subcu for Crohn's disease and data readouts on JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ-4804, our co-antibody therapeutic for inflammatory bowel disease, aticaprant for adjunctive major depressive disorder and nipocalimab for rheumatoid arthritis. In MedTech, we completed enrollment of the Omny-IRE clinical trial to evaluate safety and effectiveness in mapping and treating symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during standard ablation procedures. Also in Cardiovascular, we are preparing for the anticipated approval of VARIPULSE in the U.S. and the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. In Orthopaedics, we launched several exciting new products in the U.S., including our VELYS SPINE robot and VOLT Plating System. The plentiful pipeline progress across our businesses will ensure continued success. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $14 billion compared to $12 billion last year, which included eight months contribution from the Consumer Health business. We ended the third quarter with $20 billion of cash and marketable securities and $36 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $16 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our strong balance sheet enables us to strategically invest to grow our business while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. During the quarter, we invested nearly $5 billion in research and development. This is an increase over 2023 levels even after excluding acquired in-process R&D expense. Thus far in 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $18 billion for strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements, which includes the recent acquisition of V-Wave, another innovative treatment in heart failure, which closed last week. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are increasing our adjusted operational sales guidance. We now expect growth in the range of 5.7% to 6.2% with a midpoint of 6%. We are also increasing operational sales growth by $200 million to a range of 6.3% to 6.8% with a midpoint of $89.6 billion or 6.6%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.10, slightly above last quarter's guidance. This results in an estimated incremental positive foreign currency impact of $200 million, reducing our previous full-year negative impact to $1 billion. As such, we expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $88.6 billion or 5.4%. Regarding the rest of the P&L, with the addition of the V-Wave transaction, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting and related R&D investment, we would be on track to improve operating margins by 50 basis points, which is consistent with what we guided to at the beginning of the year. As we strive to advance and accelerate our pipeline, you can anticipate elevated levels of investment in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is now projected to be between $450 million and $550 million, $150 million greater than our previous guidance. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, an increase versus previous guidance, driven by the one-time monetization of royalty rights, which Jessica referenced, that will be utilized for that higher Q4 investment I referenced a moment ago. Our effective tax rate, consistent with previous guidance, is expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full year. Similar to last quarter, we have provided an EPS bridge to outline the impact from acquisition activity throughout the year. Before the impact of the V-Wave acquisition, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again increasing. As the schedule reflects, we are expecting an incremental $0.10 per share increase on our operational performance for a total increase of $0.18 per share for the year. On this basis, when excluding acquisition activity throughout the year, EPS growth is 9.2%. To account for the completion of the V-Wave transaction, as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per share in 2025. Combined, this yields an updated 2024 adjusted operational EPS guidance of $9.91 at the midpoint of the range, basically flat year-on-year despite absorbing approximately $0.92 of acquisition activity. While not predicting the impact of currency movements utilizing the recent exchange rates just referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year positive impact of $0.02 per share. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.93 at the midpoint. We are still finalizing our plans for next year, but let me provide you some preliminary qualitative commentary to inform your modeling for 2025. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver growth despite a significant LOE resulting in sales above the $57 billion commitment we stated in 2021. This will be driven by our end market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding the STELARA LOE, we are planning for biosimilar entries in the U.S. in January, assuming that HUMIRA's erosion curve is a relatively good proxy for your models. We continue to expect a negative impact associated with the Part D redesign. In our pipeline, we anticipate data readouts across all our priority platforms : anticipated approvals of TREMFYA subcu in Crohn's disease, RYBREVANT subcu for lung cancer and nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis, as well as potential filings for TARIS in bladder cancer and aticaprant in major depressive disorder. As a reminder, TREMFYA, RYBREVANT and TARIS continue to be the three largest underappreciated assets in terms of our revenue projections versus what analysts are estimating for the back half of this decade. For MedTech, we continue to expect to deliver on our long-term objective identified at last year's Enterprise Business Review of growing operational sales in the upper end of the 2022 through 2027 weighted average market growth rate of 5% to 7%. We also expect continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech businesses, such as VARIPULSE in electrophysiology, VELYS enabling technology across Orthopaedics, Odyssey and PureSee in Surgical Vision and contributions from our Abiomed and Shockwave integration. Specific to volume-based pricing in China, we expect continued impacts from the rollout of the 2024 tenders in Orthopaedics sports and intraocular lenses and anticipate VBP to continue expanding across provinces and products. Moving to the rest of the P&L. When thinking about operating margin, there are pluses and minuses. Tailwinds include an anticipated reduction of acquired IPR&D expense year-over-year, continued focus on MedTech margin improvement and continued OpEx optimization benefits post the separation. Working against us is unfavorable product mix driven by STELARA biosimilar entrants and Part D redesign. With a brief look at your models last week, the consensus margin does not appear unreasonable, and we'll provide further clarity in January once we complete our 2025 plan. We do not expect to maintain the heightened levels of interest income due to a reduction in interest rates and impact from debt experienced in 2024 related to acquisition activity. Regarding other income and expense, we expect lower net other income due to the non-recurring nature of the monetization of royalty rights experienced in Q3, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, as well as income lost on the Kenvue dividend. Lastly, based on what we know today, under current tax law, we anticipate our 2025 tax rate to be slightly lower than our anticipated 2024 tax rate. To wrap up prior to Q&A, we are pleased with our underlying 2024 performance that simultaneously fortified a strong foundation for continued success heading into 2025. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe just one on talc here. I know this is still limited comments, but it seems though the company has obviously made some advancements here into getting this behind the organization. Maybe just can you help us a little bit in terms of, from your perspective, next key steps to watch from here? And what is J&J's overall level of confidence that you have a path to resolve this in the relative near term for the story? Thanks so much. Joaquin Duato : Yeah, thank you, Chris. And as you have heard me before, our intention with respect to the talc litigation is to bring a responsible, final and comprehensive resolution to these claims. And we are making meaningful progress to do just that. We have filed our pre-packaged reorganization plan with the support of 83% of the claimants. And also, we have had a decision of the court to keep the filing in Houston. So, as I said, we are making progress in this resolution that I refer. As far as next steps, Erik? Erik Haas : Hi. Thanks, Chris. This is Erik Haas, Head of Worldwide Litigation. Judge Lopez last week on Thursday, after ruling that the case properly and appropriately should remain in Texas, ordered the parties to meet and confer and agree to a schedule for the expeditious resolution of the case. And by that, it means setting forth a schedule to get through to the confirmation procedure, addressing any ancillary motions, whether the motions to dismiss or issues relating to the votes. And the parties are in that process. We contemplate putting forth a schedule that resolves those issues through the end of the year for a confirmation hearing sometime at the beginning of next year. So that's the schedule we're on. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, on MedTech, maybe help us understand the impact of the one-time items in Q3, such as the ortho SKU rationalization. How you're thinking about the impact from the hurricanes in Q4? And what gives you confidence you can deliver the high end of that 5% to 7% next year? Thanks for taking the questions. Tim Schmid : Larry, thank you for the question. And we're proud of the 6.4% operational growth for the quarter -- sorry, 5.7% for full year. And I think the results really talked about the success of our deliberate move into higher-growth, higher-margin categories, especially in the cardiovascular space. You'll recall, and you'll see that from our results, almost $300 million has been added from the Shockwave acquisition, which continues to perform to expectations as does Abiomed. And we've also added to the portfolio acquisition of Laminar in the fourth quarter of last year, and then more recently, the announced closure of the acquisition of V-Wave, which, once again, takes us into even more exciting high-growth, high-margin opportunities within Cardiovascular. Specifically to Orthopaedics, we believe this is going to be another solid year for Orthopaedics, 3.2% growth for the year. We did have a slightly softer third quarter, which was a result, to your point, of the restructure within Orthopaedics. And as we look to the full year, we expect a return to a significantly better performance, especially in Orthopaedics, which typically has a stronger fourth quarter. And we are seeing tremendous performance specifically within the hips and knees categories growing 6% and 7%. And I think that's really been enabled by the success of our enabling technologies in VELYS in knees, which also, by the way, we've added indication of the [Uni Knee] (ph), as well as our KINCISE and Hip Navigation systems within hips. I'd also add to the Orthopaedics performance, we are significantly addressing portfolio gaps within our trauma portfolio with the launch of TriLeap, [indiscernible] and VOLT in the back half of the year. And I think you know our spine portfolio has been challenged, and we're addressing that with the launch of TELIGEN, our new TriALTIS thoracal lumbar system and the new spine robot, which we just received approval for. As it relates the hurricanes, we did see the impact, certainly of Hurricane Helene, in the final weeks of the third quarter and continue to see the impact of Milton over the last coming days especially in the areas most impacted by those storms. I do think the watch out that we all need to watch carefully is certainly the impact of the recently announced IV saline shortages, which if they do persist, could potentially impact surgical procedures across our portfolio. Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to ask you how you see TREMFYA, JNJ-2113 and some of your other pipeline products coming together to replace sales lost to STELARA and then take share from entrenched competitors? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Hi. Louise. It's Jennifer. And good morning, everyone. And I wanted to start off by having a chance to really recognize and thank all my Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for fabulous quarter in the third quarter. We really continue to deliver against our strategy with 11 key brands having double-digit growth and achieving a few really notable milestones, notably the TREMFYA approval and launch in ulcerative colitis, also RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first line non-small cell lung cancer, and we also completed the acquisition of NM26, which is a Phase 2-ready asset for atopic dermatitis. So, as we take a look at the immunology portfolio, we're really excited about TREMFYA, what we see as the prospects ahead. I just mentioned that we got approval during the quarter for that product in ulcerative colitis. We believe we truly have a winning proposition for that asset in IBD. And it's off to a really nice start with a good -- a really strong reception amongst the medical community. And we see that product having a lot of strength because it's the only dual act of IL-23. So, it blocks both IL-23 and the CD64 receptor cells. It really sets what we believe is a new bar in terms of efficacy with the highest rate of endoscopic normalization. And we've got rigorous head-to-head data versus STELARA showing superiority in Crohn's disease. And we think that we've got unrivaled flexibility and what will ultimately be a subcu both induction and maintenance dose for TREMFYA. So, TREMFYA was $4 billion in sales for the quarter. And that was really on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis alone. When we take a look going forward and what we had seen with STELARA in terms of the strength in IBD and the potential, we think that TREMFYA definitely is an asset that is STELARA size or bigger and better. So, a lot of exciting opportunity for us ahead. For 2113, we're really excited about our oral asset that we're developing. And I'll let John Reed, my colleague, John Reed, actually talk about why we're so excited about it and some of the data -- upcoming data there, but we do think that being able to have that advanced efficacy and known safety profile in a simple oral tablet is not only going to be great for the existing biologics' appropriate patients, but we think it gives us a great market expansion opportunity moving into earlier lines of therapy as well. John? John Reed : Yeah, thanks. The 2113 is really moving along nicely. As you know, this is our targeted oral peptide, a very exquisite, elegantly designed molecule that binds to and blocks the IL-23 receptor, and it is orally available with once-daily dosing. The psoriasis indication is fully enrolled now, four Phase 3 studies, which are quite broad and include head to heads against TYK2 inhibitors as well as both adult and adolescent patients as well as a study in patients that have disease affecting hard-to-treat areas, scalp and other parts of the anatomy that can be very difficult to clear typically. So, we're really looking quite comprehensively there, and the data will be rolling out in the next few months. So, we look forward to sharing those at the appropriate time. In inflammatory bowel disease, we're in a signal-seeking Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis where we're exploring different doses before moving into more advanced studies, given that the IL-23 pathway is well validated inflammatory bowel disease. Thanks to STELARA and TREMFYA, we're quite confident that those studies will come through for us, but we'll wait for those data later this year to see how that oral medication is faring there. The other thing I'd maybe mention just in case it's not on your radar is we also have a co-antibody approach, we call it 4804, where gus and gol, TREMFYA and our TNF inhibitor are combined for patients tend to be on the more refractory side. And we're in the middle of inflammatory bowel disease studies there that will read out next year. So, really excited about that antibody combination as well. So altogether, the immunology portfolio is really quite robust and particularly in inflammatory bowel disease in the areas of dermatology where we've had traditional strengths. Jennifer Taubert : We really do think that we've got a winning portfolio for inflammatory bowel diseases. And maybe just one addition because I know we've had questions on this in the past on 2113, we're going to be developing that really across the spectrum, so both ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease. So, we're starting off in ulcerative colitis, but absolutely have plans to develop it in Crohn's as well. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on the multiple myeloma portfolio, obviously, very nice growth in CARVYKTI this quarter. I know you spoke to some of the drivers, but just was wondering if you can elaborate on what you're seeing in the second-line setting at this point? And then, as you look at TECVAYLI through the rest of this year into next year, what's it going to take to really see an acceleration in growth in this product? Or is this -- or do we have to wait until we get to earlier lines of treatment here to see growth again in that franchise? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Hi, Terence, thanks so much for the question on multiple myeloma. And I won't go into a lot of detail on DARZALEX, but it's worth noting that we had $3 billion in sales, more than 20% growth. And DARZALEX really continues to perform quite strongly for us as we continue to grow share, particularly in frontline, in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients. I really appreciate the question on CARVYKTI. So, $286 million in sales, 88% growth year-over-year and 53% quarter-over-quarter. And we're really seeing that continued growth for a number of reasons. So first, we're seeing very strong demand based on the CARTITUDE-4 approval for that second-line-and-beyond patients. In addition, overall survival data was just presented for CARVYKTI in this line, which was very, very significant and further adds to the importance of this medicine for patients with multiple myeloma. And the other aspect is we continue to progress really nicely with our continued capacity expansion, both in terms of number of slots per day in Raritan, we gained approval for our Ghent manufacturing site in Europe for commercial production, that is now underway and able to serve patients, and our CMO in the United States as well is producing on the clinical end. And so, all the way around from performance of the product from new data as well as continued capacity expansion, we continue to see very strong performance for CARVYKTI. And as we discussed before, I don't know that we will see that as a complete exact linear growth curve quarter-to-quarter simply because the capacity expansion works in a bit more of a stair-step fashion, but as we have discussed, second quarter for us being definitely more robust than the first half, that's playing through. And I think if you think about that going forward, that makes a lot of sense. And we're over 4,200 patients now with CARVYKTI, and it is the most successful CAR-T launch for across -- throughout the industry across all CAR-Ts. Then last, you asked about TECVAYLI and talquetamab. So, if we take a look at -- start off basically with TEC. So, TEC sales were $135 million and 21% growth for the quarter, but it was flat sequentially. We're seeing really nice uptake in the market in terms of new patients. There's also a dynamic where physicians are treating with longer treatment durations. So, we do think that there's a lot of continued growth and expansion for the product. It's performing very well for patients and not only in its current lines of therapy, but we're also taking a look and studying it in combinations, whether with DARZALEX, whether with TAL. And so, we do believe that there's a lot of growth potential on there. For TALVEY, we're not reporting out the sales yet. I think we'll start on that probably next year. But both TAL and TEC, we continue to expand not only with the academic, but also out into the community setting. And so, we think there's a lot of growth ahead. John Reed : Maybe just a couple of things to highlight as well. With TEC, that is not only the first-in-class BCMA-targeting T-cell engager, but the data really showed also is best-in-class relative to other molecules in that -- of that type. The deepest responses -- complete response rates are approaching 50%, about half of patients. Duration of response is nearly two years, and very low discontinuation rates, less than 5%, showing the weight-adjusted dosing where we can really optimize for the patients, it's really playing out there. Very excited about the early data we're seeing when we combine TEC with dara, where we're seeing really high response rates in patients who have been multiply treated and now in Phase 3 studies in patients with one to three prior lines. And then, similar story with TAL. That is a B-cell preserving target, as you know. So, there are fewer risks of severe infections with TAL. And it has shown in the late line, the highest overall response rates of any T-cell engager bispecific for myeloma. So, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity there. And again, the data in combo with dara are really impressive. So, we're marching along with that combination and where we can have the benefits of both the T cell engager together with the CD38 class. And really only J&J is positioned to do that. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now live. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on the EP business. I mean, obviously, that's very topical. You haven't really seen much of a slowdown. I appreciate Q3 was probably arguably the first quarter where we had a more -- a full quarter of PFA launching. I guess, I'm just curious about what you think the underlying market is growing and where PFA is versus RF, and also, as we look ahead to 2025 and VARIPULSE, how that changes dynamics for J&J's EP business. Thanks so much. Tim Schmid : Thank you, Danielle. And as you said, it is a really exciting time to be in electrophysiology. And we couldn't be more proud of the significant leadership position we've held in this category for more than 20 years. And just to put our performance in context, our EP business is a $5 billion business, which grew 11% in the third quarter and 17% year-to-date. We are actively progressing our launch of VARIPULSE in EMEA and in Japan, where we still are executing against our soft launches. We've had over 800 successful cases. We shared the data from our admIRE study at the recent HRS meeting showing 85% primary effectiveness in that portfolio and that product. And we believe we've got a product that really will hunt. As it relates to the U.S., you're right, we're seeing continued competition, especially in the ablation space, given that we don't currently have a PFA product. But having spent a lot of time in EP labs over the last couple of weeks, I can tell you that we are incredibly excited for the availability of VARIPULSE, which we expect to have approval sometime later this quarter or in Q1 of next year. We are still, by the way, mapping the majority of those cases, Danielle. That's what most people don't see is that while we may not have that product in the portfolio, we are mapping more than 50% of competitive cases. In fact, we've updated our market-leading CARTO software to actually reflect better visualization for competitive products. And what we've seen in the market, and I can't give you specific data, but a significant increase in procedures on the time it's taking EPs to perform ablation procedures with PFA. And by the way, today, we're benefiting from the volume increase from PFA even though we don't have that catheter. And so, that combination of the 5,500 installed base of CARTO system's best-in-class mapping and highly trained mappers, we believe, is a significant advantage and positions us extremely well when PFA comes to market. I will also say that similar to RF, which by the way, we still believe has a play within the portfolio, we have the best-in-class RF catheter with QDOT, 86% primary effectiveness, this winning strategy in RF has been a full portfolio. And similarly, in PFA, beyond our first launch with VARIPULSE, you will see a full portfolio of focal, large focal single shot and dual energy catheters. By the way, we already applied for CE marking for our dual energy catheter. And so, we're confident in our leadership position in EP and our sources of differentiation for the future. Thank you, Danielle. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Shagun Singh : Good. Thank you so much. I was hoping you could elaborate on the dynamics that you're seeing in the Asia Pacific region in MedTech, specifically China. Could you quantify the headwind? When do you expect it to normalize? And you did talk about China VBP, and that has expanded into additional provinces and products. So, could you just elaborate on the impact there, and how we should think about it in '25? Thank you. Tim Schmid : Thank you, Shagun. And yes, we've had a myriad of issues hitting us in the Asia Pacific region of late. And let me just highlight a couple, and I'll certainly get to your question on China. Firstly, you may know that in February of this year in Korea, the government initiated or at least a strike was initiated among the healthcare professional community. Unfortunately, we don't see any end in sight to that. And so that certainly has been a headwind. We're seeing macroeconomic pressures in Japan. And then, more importantly, to your question, the ongoing impact of volume-based procurement, which has also been exacerbated by the anti-corruption campaign. And by the way, while we believe this is absolutely the right thing to do and we support it for the long term, it is impacting procedures and the engagement by healthcare professionals with companies like ours, especially on premium products. We have a leadership position. We have the largest medtech company in China. And given the high leadership positions, we are seeing a disproportionate impact from VBP. We have five major categories impacted through tenders in 2023 in electrophysiology, trauma, spine, endocutters and energy, and more recently, IOLs and sports in our Orthopaedics business. We do believe that this will be a headwind through the remainder of '24 and into '25. That said, we are absolutely confident that China continues and will continue to be an important part of our portfolio. Even with the impact of VBP, we believe we can deliver tremendous growth and returns for our shareholders. And I think this really talks to the strength of our global portfolio across medtech, the fact that we can offset headwinds in one geography with better performance in places like Europe and the U.S. Please rest assured, we also believe that this part of the world, especially in Asia Pacific, will continue to be a growth opportunity. And let me tell you why. 60% of the world's patients live in that part of the world. And we're proud of the fact that we've been in many of these markets many, many years and expect to continue to do so. The final point I'll make is, let's remember, while, this is a headwind for MedTech, this is not material to Johnson & Johnson. When we look at our global sales across Johnson & Johnson, less than 5% of our business is in China. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the immunology side, just on TREMFYA and STELARA. So, you mentioned the U.S. sales for both those products were a little bit lighter. And we were expecting and you mentioned this unfavorable patient mix impact in the quarter. So, I'm just curious if you can just go in a little more detail on what you're seeing for those products in the U.S. specifically. And is this patient mix issue sort of this quarter? Is it adjustments from prior quarters? And is it something specific to Johnson & Johnson, or is it maybe something broader to the immunology market? Thank you. Jessica Moore : Yeah, Vamil. If you talk about with patient mix, this would be something that is specific to some of the true-ups that we do. As you are all aware, we end up having to make an assessment on our gross to net reduction. And as we get final bills in, there always are some true-ups. Sometimes they're for the positive, sometimes it is a negative reduction. So, when we refer to patient mix, this is different patients coming through different channels as well as some of the accounting true-ups for the final payments that we make. Then, I will hand it over to Jennifer to specifically talk about the performance and the commercial perspective of TREMFYA and STELARA in the U.S. Jennifer Taubert : And I think -- so if we look for TREMFYA, outside the U.S., really nice growth at 27%. In the U.S., it was a little over 9% specifically for that patient mix issue that Jess just spoke about. We do think that the prospects are very strong for continued TREMFYA growth based on what I articulated before around the launches in ulcerative colitis and the upcoming launches that we're planning for in Crohn's disease as well. I think for STELARA, we did see a decline and that, again, sort of similar patient mix piece in the U.S. We've also -- and also we've noted the decline ex U.S., particularly in EMEA due to biosimilar competition. We know that STELARA is near or at its end of life and really that TREMFYA and across the rest of our portfolio, we've got a very robust stable of products with pretty significant growth. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Vamil. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. Maybe just a question for either Tim or Joe. Appreciate the color on MedTech, but the 5% bogey for the year still implies a decent acceleration in 4Q off a tougher comp. What gets better in 4Q? And then, just a quick clarification. The IV solutions dynamic from Helene, are you seeing an impact on volumes outside of Western North Carolina and Florida? Thanks. Tim Schmid : Jayson, thank you for the question. And let me hit the last one first. No, we have seen the majority of the impact in the areas impacted by that storm. As I mentioned earlier, I think the watch out is any potential impact from additional shortage of IV fluid, which may impact elective procedures, and certainly, we're continuing to monitor that very carefully. As Joe mentioned, we expect now on the back of the headwinds we mentioned earlier in Asia Pacific to deliver adjusted operational growth of around 5% and north of 6% on an operational basis for the year. We believe that the momentum we're carrying into the fourth quarter, especially in our Cardiovascular businesses with our winning portfolio in electrophysiology, strong double-digit growth in Shockwave, Abiomed, I mean, those are, as you can see from the performance, absolute home runs. The other important dynamic here is that, as we signaled in the first and second quarter, we expect to see improvement within our Vision business, which typically has delivered solid single -- mid-single-digit growth. We had a tremendous third quarter, which really gives us confidence in even stronger fourth. This was delivered by much better performance, especially in our contact lens business. In fact, here in the U.S., our most important market, double-digit growth for contact lenses in the quarter. And this just really has been delivered from a stabilization of our distributor inventory in the U.S., the fact that we're able to get back to taking new wearer share now that we have unconstrained supply, especially within our astig portfolio. And so, we do believe that Vision has a very strong quarter ahead. And then finally, across the portfolio, we're benefiting from tremendous new product launches, both within Cardiovascular, the E8 peripheral catheter within Shockwave, continued performance within Abiomed with our broad portfolio of pumps. And then, within our surgery business as well as orthopaedics, as I mentioned earlier, tremendous new products to add differentiation to the portfolio. And typically, that fourth quarter also is a stronger one for us. So, once again, very confident in our performance at around 5% on an adjusted basis and north of 6% operationally. Thank you. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Jayson, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I would now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you have heard, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our high-innovation and high-growth portfolio and pipelines are advancing rapidly, and we are increasingly confident in our expectations for 2025 and beyond. Enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last a little over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a year of progress and transformation for Johnson & Johnson. Today, we operate in a broad set of high unmet need, high growth and high innovation segments, including oncology, immunology and neuroscience in Innovative Medicine and cardiovascular, vision and robotics in MedTech. In 2024, we continue to make disciplined decisions to exit lower priority businesses while investing industry leading amount in our pipeline, approximately $50 billion in R&D and M&A in the last year, inclusive of the recently announced acquisition agreement with Intra-Cellular Therapies, which I will speak about shortly. And while we have been through a period of transformation, the fundamentals of our company remain the same. Indeed, our enduring success is rooted in two things. First, we are a purpose-driven company guided by Our Credo. And second, we are broadly diversified, meaning that we can truly lead where medicine is going. No other company has the span of expertise and capabilities that Johnson & Johnson has. No other company can impact the entire patient journey as we do. We are not just a Pharma company or a MedTech company. We are a health care company. And our strategies are disease centric focused on end-to-end solutions. Just think about multiple myeloma and the impact of DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Think about heart recovery and the impact of Abiomed's Impella heart pumps and the promise of V-Waves minimally invasive interatrial shunt. Think about mental health and the impact of our INVEGA portfolio, SPRAVATO and the potential of the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition we announced last week. And think about inflammatory bowel disease and the impact of STELARA and TREMFYA and the potential of our targeted oral peptide that blocks IL-23 Icotrokinra and JNJ-4804, our Co-antibody Therapeutic targeting IL-23 and TNF. As the only major health care company focused both on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Technology, we are unique in the industry with the financial muscle, global reach and this is expertise to deliver the sustained high pace of growth and innovation that is the hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. The strategic decisions we made in 2024 position Johnson & Johnson for sustained growth through the second half of the decade and beyond and strengthen our confidence in our 2025 guidance. Now to the numbers for 2024. Over the full year, we delivered robust operational sales growth of 7% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. With SPRAVATO surpassing $1 billion in annual sales, we now have 26 platforms that generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a third consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 10 key brands growing double-digit. Across the full year, we achieved strong growth in oncology, neuroscience and pulmonary hypertension with immunology performing well despite the entry of biosimilars for STELARA in the EU. Equally impressive is our pace of innovation, which in 2024 resulted in 27 approvals in major markets, including FDA approvals of TREMFYA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE for first line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In 2024, we reported 18 positive readouts for registrational studies, initiated 16 Phase III studies and submitted 49 filings across major markets. And as you have seen over the last three weeks, we are off to a fast start in 2025. RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE showed significant in overall survival in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We received FDA approval of SPRAVATO as the first and only monotherapy for adults with treatment resistant depression. We received priority review for Nipocalimab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in addition to the FDA breakthrough therapy and Fast Track designations for other indications received last year. And last week, we announced a new drug application with the FDA for TAR-200, our intravesical drug releasing system for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and area of significant unmet need impacting as many as 1 million patients per year. Turning to MedTech. For the full year, we reported a second year of over $30 billion in sales with growth across most part of the business, including particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular ambition. Our pace of MedTech innovation also continues to accelerate with 15 major products launched in 2024. Major highlights of the year include the approval of our VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation platform in several major markets and FDA clearance of our VELYS robotic assisted solution for the use in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty procedures as well as an expanded FDA indication for Impella heart pumps to treat pediatric patients and FDA clearance of Shockwave's Javelin Peripheral IVL Catheter for the treatment of tight, difficult to close peripheral lesions. We also achieved the full market release of 10 major products including the Shockwave E8 Peripheral IVL Catheter in the US. Version 8 of the CARTO 3 Electroanatomical Mapping System and our TECNIS Odyssey Intraocular Lens. And we progressed 18 clinical trial programs including the IDE approval of our OTTAVA robotic surgical system, which allows clinical trials to begin at US sites. And last year, we fortified our future by making significant value creating investments in M&A. These investments enable us to further shift our portfolio to address our mandates in high growth and high innovation markets. This included the acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx Proteologix and the NM26 biospecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And building on our nearly 70 year legacy neuroscience, we announced last week plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for Central Nervous System Disorders. This unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies reflects our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in mental health. It also further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations now and through the remainder of the decade. Together, these transactions represent industry leading levels of investment for the company, providing strategic near and long-term growth catalyst for Johnson & Johnson. Turning to 2025. And as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3%, overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for STELARA and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China. Perhaps even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion dollar product. We are able to achieve these results because of the diversification of our business, the strength of our commercial assets as well as the breadth of our pipeline with additional launches in 2025 including TREMFYA in IBD, RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE in lung cancer and VARIPULSE and the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter in electrophysiology. In closing, I want to thank everyone at Johnson & Johnson for all that they do to help patients. We are starting the year from a position of strength and we have confidence in our sales growth and EPS guidance for 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jess. Jessica Moore : Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore excludes the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2024 sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 6.7% with growth of 10% in the US and 2.5% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 290 basis points due to STELARA and positively impacted by 100 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures. It's important to note growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 720 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.41 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.70 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.04, representing decreases of 11.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.22 of acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. For the full year 2024, sales were $88.8 billion. Sales grew 5.9% with growth of 8.3% in the US and 2.9% outside of the US. STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine negatively impacted worldwide growth by 260 basis points. Acquisition and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 50 basis points. Growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 670 basis points due to the COVID-19 vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of STELARA. Net earnings for the full year 2024 were $14.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.79 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.20 a year ago. Full year 2024 adjusted net earnings were $24.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.98, representing a decrease of 4.6% and an increase of 0.6% respectively versus full year 2023. Earnings per share in the year was negatively impacted by $0.67 due to acquired IPR&D charges on various transactions throughout the year. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.3 billion increased 6.5% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine with growth of 11.1% in the US and a decline of 0.3% outside of the US. STELARA negatively impacted worldwide growth by 490 basis points. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price adjustments associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Starting with oncology. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 23.5%, primarily driven by share gains of over three points across all lines of therapy and six points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. This marks Johnson & Johnson's first brand to achieve over $3 billion in sales in a quarter. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $334 million with growth of over 100% driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 17.3% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $146 million in the quarter with growth of 18%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. As a reminder, we anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in the category Other Oncology. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 22.7%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth, reaching $3 billion in annual sales for the first time. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in the category Other Oncology as we continue to expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 5.6%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and inventory dynamics. We are excited about the recent UC launch and expect to see strong uptake of the IBD indications in 2025. STELARA declined 13.6% driven by the impact of current and anticipated biosimilar competition. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered the US in January 2025. REMICADE and SIMPONI worldwide sales were positively impacted by return of distribution rights in Europe. In Neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 45.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient demand. As Joaquin mentioned, SPRAVATO has exceeded $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Other Neuroscience decline was driven by the loss of a SPINRAZA tender in Europe. In Pulmonary Hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 2.5%, driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics in the US and austerity measures in Europe. Starting in 2025, we will begin to report OPSYNVI, which is currently reported in the category Other Pulmonary Hypertension in OPSUMIT. UPTRAVI grew 12. 1%, driven by market growth, patient mix and share gains. Finally, XARELTO sales growth was driven by favorable patient mix. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 7.6% both in the US and outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 300 basis points on worldwide growth, 430 basis points in the US and 150 basis points outside of the US. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by increased competitive PFA pressures in US electrophysiology and continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, primarily in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 7.3%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the US and VBP in China. Despite the IV saline shortage in the US, Abiomed delivered growth of 13.2% driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact Lenses and Other grew 7.4%, driven by trade inventory dynamics, continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision growth of 13.6% was driven by TECNIS PureSee & TECNIS Eyhance. Commercial execution partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Orthopedics grew 2.5% inclusive of hips growth of 5.6%, primarily driven by the success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation, impacts of China VBP and competitive pressures. Lastly, Surgery grew 0.4% with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 130 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price adjustments primarily associated with hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels to fortify our future, investing $5.3 billion or nearly 24% of sales, which includes $540 million of acquired IPR&D expense associated with the V-Wave acquisition. Selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales deleveraged 150 basis points driven by increased commercial investment in the Innovative Medicine business. Interest income and expense was a net income of $144 million as compared to $212 million of income last year driven by lower interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance and higher interest rates on a higher average debt balance. Other income and expense was a net income of $161 million compared to $421 million of income in the prior year. This was primarily driven by lower gains on securities, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs due to the discount rate, partially offset by lower litigation expense in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 11.7% versus 14.4% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by post-acquisition integration efforts that allowed the company to deduct certain acquisition costs for tax purposes as well as the resolution of prior tax matters both in jurisdictions outside of the US. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.8% versus 10.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2024 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible, amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 37.4% to 32.5% primarily driven by strategic commercial investment and R&D pipeline advancement. MedTech margin declined from 15.5% to 10. 8% primarily driven by acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. Please note that the MedTech margin was negatively impacted in both years due to expenses associated with the strategic acquisition of Laminar. When adjusting for these one-time items, MedTech margin was relatively flat. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.2% to 24.1% with the V-Wave acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 240 basis points. When looking at the full year, Innovative Medicine, MedTech and the Enterprise adjusted income before tax remained relatively flat year-over-year when adjusting for the one-time items highlighted on the slide, mainly acquired IPR&D expenses on various transactions across both years. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe. Joseph Wolk : Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you've heard already, we delivered solid overall fourth quarter and full year results in 2024, above the operational guidance we set at the beginning of the year when excluding acquisition costs we incurred to fortify our business for the future. We are particularly pleased with advancements made throughout the year, strengthening our pipeline, achieving key milestones across core therapeutic areas and platforms. We continue to prioritize investment and innovation, forge strategic partnerships that further enhance our differentiated business and focus on improving margins positioning the company for near and long-term growth. Additionally, we've made progress toward resolving the talc litigation. As many of you are aware, our prepackaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from current claimants and the futures claims representative and that support has only increased in recent months. The next milestone is the scheduled confirmation hearing commencing on February 18th in the Southern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court. Now let's get into the numbers, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended 2024 with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $37 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $12 billion. Our focus on cash flow resulted in the company delivering approximately $20 billion of free cash flow during 2024, $1.6 billion more than in 2023, despite having higher litigation settlement payments during 2024, higher TCJA toll tax and eight months of contribution from Consumer Health in 2023. Our ability to strategically invest and deploy capital that unlocks value has made Johnson & Johnson successful in the past and will be as important for our success moving forward. We evaluate strong credit rating, which underscores the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial discipline and enables us to execute against our capital allocation priorities. In Research and Development, we invested more than $17 billion or 19.4% of sales. We remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. 2024 marked the 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed to over $32 billion in strategic value-creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes larger transactions such as Shockwave, Proteologix, the NM26 bispecific antibody, V-Wave, the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies as well as more than 40 smaller early-stage collaborations and partnerships to complement our businesses that are much more common for us than larger transactions. As we look ahead to 2025, we will maintain a heightened focus on cash flow generation to build on our strong financial foundation and judiciously deploy capital on behalf of shareholders to create value. Let's now discuss our full year guidance for 2025. It is important to note that guidance at this time excludes the impact from the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, but I will provide some comments on that transaction in a few moments. We anticipate operational sales in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% with a midpoint of $91.3 billion or 3.0% in line with the expectations outlined at our late 2023 enterprise business review as Joaquin noted. Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to favorably impact operational growth by approximately 50 basis points resulting in an adjusted operational sales growth midpoint of 2.5%. Sales growth across our innovative medicine businesses will be driven by our proven assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA and SPRAVATO. Our recently launched products, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY and our new launches of TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in lung cancer. The strength of our portfolio enables Innovative Medicine to grow despite the expanded STELARA biosimilar competition and approximately $2 billion negative impact from Part D redesign. MedTech sales growth will be driven by our recent acquisitions, Shockwave and Abiomed as well as continued uptake of our recently launched products such as VARIPULSE, TECNIS Odyssey, ACUVUE OASYS MAX, the VELYS portfolio of enabling technology and our barbed suture and hemostat portfolio. We continue to expect China to remain a headwind through 2025. Regarding VARIPULSE in the US, we are working diligently to complete our investigation and we'll provide an update when we have additional information to share. As a reminder, there is no impact to commercial activity to VARIPULSE outside of the United States. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing yesterday's euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04 significantly below last quarter's euro spot rate of $1.10. This results in an estimated unfavorable foreign currency impact on sales of $1.7 billion or 2.0%, as such, we estimate reported 2025 sales of $89.6 billion or 1% growth at the midpoint. Turning to other items on the P&L. Despite STELARA biosimilar competition and the impact of Part D redesign, we expect our 2025 adjusted pre-tax operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points of which approximately half is driven by operating spend management and the remainder from reduced acquired IPR&D expense. This is about 50 basis points better than we discussed on the Q3 earnings call in October. We anticipate net other income to be $900 million to $1.1 billion for 2025. The reduction versus last year is primarily driven by a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, the nonrecurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024 and no longer receiving a Kenvue dividend. Due to higher debt incurred associated with 2024 acquisitions and the reduction in interest rates earned on cash, we expect net interest income between zero and $100 million. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2025 in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% based on current tax laws and our anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.75 to $10.95. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rate previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year negative impact of $0.25. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.60 at the midpoint. When adjusting for this impact, it becomes clear that our operational EPS performance is considerably stronger than consensus assumed as only about half the analysts incorporated the impact of foreign currency into their models. A few initial considerations outlined on this chart regarding the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a transaction we plan to finance mainly with debt. We are not planning for material near-term cost synergies. Rather, we expect to accelerate penetration of CAPLYTA in existing markets, explore additional geographies to commercialize the portfolio and potentially accelerate research and development to expand into new indications and disease areas where high unmet need exists. Given this and assuming a close subject to regulatory review early in the second quarter, we anticipate an acceleration of our sales growth of approximately 80 basis points. Inclusive of the impact of financing cost, the transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 in 2025. Again, these are very preliminary thoughts, which will be influenced by when the transaction closes and borrowing rates. We will be sure to provide an update to our full year guidance shortly after the acquisition is complete. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on the phasing of notable events for your modeling. We expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding Innovative Medicine, we anticipate STELARA biosimilar competition to accelerate throughout the year as the number of biosimilar entrants increase. HUMIRA's erosion curve, once faced with material biosimilar competition continues to be the best proxy for STELARA erosion with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year. We expect a more pronounced benefit from our newly launched products as we progress throughout 2025 to counter these headwinds. In MedTech, for the first half of the year and more prominently in Q1, we faced tougher year-over-year comparisons, excluding the positive impact associated with the Shockwave acquisition. We anticipate acceleration of our newly launched products to build throughout the year. As we've said before, we continue to expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality. Regarding the P&L, it is important to consider one-time items that impacted our EPS results in 2024. Specifically, the benefit of Kenvue dividend in the first two quarters of 2024 is not repeating. Higher interest income prior to the Shockwave acquisition closure in May, the monetization of royalty rights recorded in Q3 and IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody in Q3 and V-Wave acquisition in Q4. Given these factors and aligned with sales, we expect higher earnings per share growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Moving to the discussion beyond financial commitments. We are excited for the pipeline progress planned for 2025. In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals for TREMFYA subcutaneous for Crohn's disease, nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis and subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to file for regulatory approval of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Icotrokinra in psoriasis and planned data readouts for RYBREVANT lung cancer overall survival as well as data in head and neck and colorectal cancer and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head-to-head data versus TYK2 in psoriasis. In MedTech, building upon the 15 major product launches in 2024, we anticipate a submission to the FDA for Impella ECP regulatory approval, continued progress on our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio, including electrophysiology, heart recovery and circulatory restoration. So to summarize, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges in 2025, continue to advance our pipeline, deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Our success is the result of the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who share a sincere passion to successfully serve patients around the world. We are extremely grateful for their efforts. With that, we are happy to take your questions. So I will now turn it to Kevin to provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Obviously, myeloma franchise is a very important growth driver as we think about history, but also 2025. So just wondering if you can kind of frame for us how you're thinking about that, both from the bispecifics as well as CAR-T and maybe a broadening into the community setting and the pace of growth here as we think about the ramp in '25? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert : Great. Well, good morning, Terence, and hello, everybody. I'd like to start by thanking all of our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a very strong quarter. This was our third quarter with sales over $14 billion with 10 key brands achieving double-digit growth and Terence I will come back to that. That includes brands like DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TALVEY and TECVAYLI as well as ones such as ERLEADA, SPRAVATO and UPTRAVI. We're making really nice progress on our launches, including TREMFYA in ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in non-small cell lung cancer. And just an important note, we hit our $57 billion target this year, a year early. For those that were here back at our enterprise review, we had made that commitment to hit the $57 billion by 2025 and we cleared that goal this year in 2024. So multiple myeloma is really an extraordinary franchise for us. And maybe I will start with DARZALEX because our quarter was over $3 billion. It was $3.1 billion and 22% growth and we continue to really build out share across the frontline settings in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients and in triplet and quad regimens. And so we're performing very well for DARZALEX and anticipate that to continue. And in fact, with DARZALEX, it's our first brand to hit $3 billion in quarterly sales. So important to note that milestone too. CARVYKTI had a really, really robust quarter as well as year nearing $1 billion for the year, $963 million as we continue to see very strong demand in that second-line plus setting as well as very strong capacity expansion in the US, in Europe and also with a contract manufacturer. And so we've talked before about that being more of a stair step rather than a direct linear line and it is performing very, very well and we're seeing nice continued expansion in the first quarter of this year that will also continue throughout the year. For TEC and TAL both products did well. We report sales, we break out sales on TEC. We don't yet on TAL. Both of these agents are best-in-class bispecifics. They're performing very well from a competitive share standpoint. We've got them nicely being utilized in the academic setting and we're working that out into more of the community setting, which will be important for their continued growth and uptake. So in total, multiple myeloma really is a stronghold for us and we're not stopping there. Because of the strength that we have, the assets that we have, we're also working on multiple additional types of combinations. John, maybe you want to address what we're doing with the bispecifics specifically. John Reed : Yes. Thank you, Jennifer. Maybe before I jump in, I'll follow your lead and just offer my appreciation and thanks to our colleagues in Innovation Medicine R&D. We had a heck of a year for the pipeline, 27 approvals, 49 submissions, 15 out of 17 positive Phase IIIs, more than 90% success rate. 9 out of 12 POCs came in positive, exceeding the industry benchmarks by approximately double, 10 first-in-humans, 10 new NMEs added to the pipeline from internal research at a price point well below the industry median and quite an impressive year on the BD front with five bolt-on acquisitions and six new molecules added to the pipeline. So my congratulations to the team. Now on the point around our broad portfolio of myeloma medicines, this is where we are now bringing them together to reinvent the next frontline therapies. And if you were at the ASH Congress, the American Society of Hematology, you saw some of the early tantalizing data where in early lines of therapy front, first, second line of myeloma, we're bringing DARA together with either TEC or TAL and we've been getting 100% minimal residual disease negativity, MRD negativity, showing the impressive potential of these new combinations. Mind you, last year, the FDA declared MD or minimal residual disease negativity or MRD as a surrogate endpoint within myeloma that could form the basis for accelerated approvals. So we're really excited about bringing these into earlier lines. And then I would also remind you with CARVYKTI, we are now doing studies in frontline transplant eligible and ineligible and asking whether we can replace autologous stem cell transplant with our CAR-T therapy as a new opportunity there to break through with unprecedented outcomes for patients. CARVYKTI, of course, already is the go-to regimen in the second line setting, the only CAR-T for myeloma approved in that setting. And last year, we reported overall survival data for CARVYKTI in a randomized setting with an impressive hazard ratio of 0.55. So really feel great about bringing CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy as well. Jennifer Taubert : Maybe hot off the press last night. The team was very excited to come tell me. We've actually completed and reached our 5000th patient infused with CARVYKTI, both across the clinical and commercial settings. And it is the most successful cell therapy launched in the industry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live Joshua Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask about the medical device or the sector, the business, excuse me, and just the acquisition strategy. You've had a couple of pre-revenue swings with Laminar and V-Wave and some other more established more established businesses under the roof. Can you just talk about the strategy on a go-forward basis? I mean is it going to continue to be a mix between pre-revenue companies and formally more fully established business or are you going to be -- is there going to be a shift in that strategy? Thanks for taking the question. Joaquin Duato : Thank you, Josh. It's Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. External innovation has always been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy for Johnson & Johnson for the enterprise. And in fact, we are one of the top investors not only in M&A, but also in R&D. We are always looking for opportunities to be able to enhance our portfolio and our pipeline. And in 2024 alone, we completed more than 40 business development transactions. Some of them were big, some of them were small, but all of them complement both our Innovative and MedTech portfolio. Many of these smaller acquisitions were also in our MedTech portfolio. You have to think that larger acquisitions like the case of Shockwave or in the Innovative Medicine side, Intra-Cellular are more outliers. Our go-forward, it's always been focused on these smaller opportunities like the ones you mentioned like Laminar or V-Wave or some of the ones we have completed the Innovative Medicines like TARIS or our IL-23 blocker, which are more than $5 billion opportunities. That's where we are able to create value, larger opportunities have to be seen more like outliers. And finally, I want to underline that both Abiomed and Shockwave are progressing really well ahead of the deal model, delivering on our financial commitments there and that we are looking forward upon closure to start working on the Intra-Cellular acquisition, which is an opportunity to reinforce our position of leadership in the Neuroscience space, which has been always a strength of Johnson & Johnson and also an opportunity overall to fortify revenue projections that you have looking today and also into the future. Thank you. Joseph Wolk : And Josh maybe just building on Joaquin's comments relative to MedTech. While the big acquisitions get a lot of attention, to Joaquin's point, we have a tremendous amount of business development activity across all of our businesses. I think most notably evidenced by almost 40 transactions just in '24 alone. I did want to point to the excitement we have around the significant investments we've made both in Abiomed and Shockwave. Abiomed grew 15% for full year 2024 and we are seeing constant acceleration driven by firstly, the tremendous portfolio we have. I think we could not be more excited about the danger shock results, which really bring more validity to the evidence base around this portfolio. This is the first study in 20 years to actually demonstrate a survival benefit, in fact, a 12.7% mortality improvement versus the standard of care. We also, while not a big commercial opportunity, received FDA approval in the fourth quarter of last year for the use of Impella in pediatric community, which I think is just further evidence of the building confidence around the safety profile of this product. We also mentioned earlier that we are excited to be planning our submission for ECP to the FDA in the first half of this year. This will, Josh, be the first and actually the smallest pump in the world. This is a 9-French at insertion, which expands to about 21-French inside the heart, a lower profile, which we believe that along with its ease of use, reduce further barriers to adoption. And then finally, a smaller transaction, but certainly important to our goal to play a bigger role in heart failure is the acquisition of V-Wave, which reinforces our commitment to building leadership in heart failure and really allows for the active shunting of blood across the intraatrial septum. A quick couple of comments on Shockwave. It's our latest acquisition. We closed that in May of last year. This delivered $564 million of growth last year. It is the leading and first-to-market pioneer in IVL technology. And we're confident that while certainly, there's a lot of excitement around this category, we have at least a five to eight year first-mover advantage. And this comes down to the fact that we have an easy-to-use system with now six available catheters. We've also recently announced the addition of two additional catheters, our E8 catheter, which is our workhorse within peripheral as well as Javelin, which is a novel non-balloon based IVL catheter designed to modify calcium and cross extremely narrowed vessels. And so we feel enormously confident that while big investments, they will make tremendous impact on patients and continue to drive our business. Thank you, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Alexandria Hammond : Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the Intra-Cellular deal last week. For CAPLYTA, how should we be thinking about the cadence of sales growth to the forecasted sales of $5 billion? And I guess on the acquisition, should we expect a deprioritization of seltorexant and aticaprant? Thank you so much. Jennifer Taubert : Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. And we are so excited to be able to welcome the Intra-Cellular colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They have done such an extraordinary job, both in developing CAPLYTA and their pipeline, but also commercializing and bringing CAPLYTA to patients currently for schizophrenia as well as for bipolar I and bipolar II depression. I think you can take a look at their current sales trajectory, which is a really nice growth curve and then also take into account the filing that has done for AMDD, major depressive disorder. The filing has been done with the regulatory authorities that we anticipate approval for later in the year. AMDD, we believe to ultimately be the largest of those three indications for CAPLYTA. And so we think that, that will be an additional catalyst for growth. So you can factor that into your thinking. We're really excited about CAPLYTA. I know the company had guided to it being a $5 billion plus asset. We definitely think that it will be as well and think that together we're going to be able to do even more for patients with mental health issues. We're also really excited about their pipeline and 1284 and potential in Alzheimer's psychosis, general anxiety disorder and others. So we see Intra-Cellular as both in near-term as well as long-term growth catalyst for us. John Reed : Yes. About your question, though, around whether we'll deprioritize other things in the portfolio, absolutely not. Let me just remind everyone that depression is a very heterogeneous disorder and it's not a disease that accommodates to a one size fits all. We see each of these molecules that we're developing, having unique mechanisms that can play in different subpopulations. And we're developing those aticaprant, seltorexant, for example, using a precision neuroscience strategy. So we see this broad portfolio, which includes, of course, SPRAVATO as a repertoire of different mechanisms we can bring to bear. The 260 million people worldwide that suffer from chronic depression. It's the leading cause of disability and more than 30% of those do not get relief from the ongoing medicines. The other thing that I really like about our portfolio is the side effect profiles are so benign compared to the standard of care. With all four of the mechanisms, whether it's CAPLYTA, which we hope to welcome into the portfolio, whether its aticaprant, seltorexant or SPRAVATO, you don't have weight gain, you don't have sexual dysfunction, you don't have the tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal effects that are so common with many of the medicines today. So this is really exciting for us. Maybe also while I am talking about our depression portfolio, I would just acknowledge and congratulate the team on the recent approval of SPRAVATO in the monotherapy context. This indeed allows us to offer SPRAVATO as a solution for patients with treatment resistant depression without necessity to use it on top of standard of care and therefore avoiding those side effects that I just mentioned that the standard of care medicines often bring. Very excited about that approval. We had received priority review from the FDA for that submission. That's the second time SPRAVATO had received a prior review, the only antidepressant ever to do so. And SPRAVATO is also the only antidepressant to ever receive breakthrough designation from the FDA. So great momentum and a long-term commitment to patients suffering with depression. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Tim Anderson : Thank you very much. I have a question on immunology franchise and TREMFYA. So with STELARA facing biosimilars, I'm wondering if it might play out like how it has with AbbVie. So in the case of AbbVie they said that biosimilar HUMIRA is actually driven the volume shifts in favor of other brands like Skyrizi. I'm wondering if you expect that could occur with TREMFYA on the volume side. And then on the price side, can you talk about incremental price erosion in 2025 to maintain access relative to whatever the price erosion was in 2024. Jennifer Taubert : Thank you very much for the question. And we're really excited about the great progress that we're making with TREMFYA. In psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but really particularly with inflammatory bowel diseases coming up with the launch in ulcerative colitis now and Crohn's upcoming. We've guided maybe just back on STELARA, we've talked about the HUMIRA erosion curve being probably the best thing to model. Specific to your question about should there or will there be patient switches. I think there are a lot of patients in the immunology market right now that are in need of both advanced therapies or are in need of better therapies than they are on now. And so we do see across the board, shifting of patients and movement into the newer and the better products. I would put TREMFYA squarely in that camp. We've got lots of reasons. We focus in on IBD and the potential growth for TREMFYA. We've got a lot of reasons for great optimism there and differentiation. It's the only dual-acting IL-23 agent in IBD, acts on both IL-23 as well as CD64. We think it's got the potential to really set the next bar in efficacy and we know there are a lot of patients who need more and are ready for switch. And we think with our subcu induction dose, we're going to have unrivaled flexibility. So the ability for fully subcu induction and maintenance as well as the opportunity for IV. So the launch right now is going very well in UC and we're very excited and optimistic really looking forward to the upcoming launch in Crohn's and subcu. And we've invested appropriately, last part of the question, I think, was on pricing. We've invested appropriately to make sure that we've got the right access for patients with TREMFYA so that as we launch, we've got the abilities when prescribers want to write for patients. We've got the access to be able to do so. And we're seeing that right now with strong frontline commercial coverage for TREMFYA in UC as well as a permanent J-code. So that is in and sort of factored into what we're seeing now. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, how are you thinking about the growth of the MedTech market in 2025 and J&J relative to the market? And what are you assuming for the EP business and VARIPULSE? Thanks for taking the question. Tim Schmid : Thank you, Larry, and appreciate your continued interest in our business. Let me start with the market, Larry. We communicated that the Enterprise Business Review that we saw our end markets growing roughly 5% to 7%. As we look at procedures within the year to come, we believe that they have, for the most part, normalized. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we expected some tailwinds on the back of clearing of the backlog, specifically in orthopedic procedures. We believe that for the most part around the world, procedures have normalized to pre-COVID levels and we expect the same as we now move into 2025. Specific to electrophysiology, I did want to firstly acknowledge that out of an abundance of caution, we recently announced a temporary pause of all US VARIPULSE cases while we investigate the root cause of four reported neurovascular events. And, Larry, while disappointing, this is an easy decision for us aligned to Our Credo. Patient safety is always an absolute priority for us. And frankly given that we are collaborating now with the FDA on this matter, this is all we will be sharing at this time. We will proactively provide further updates when we have additional information to share. I do have I think it's important to remind everyone that this announcement is specific to the US and there is no expected impact to VARIPULSE cases outside of the US where the rollout of the technology has been successful with approximately 3,000 commercial cases completed. I do think important, it's important to reinforce that while we are facing a headwind today, we have tremendous opportunity in the electrophysiology space. It's an exciting market, as you know, with relatively low global penetration well under 5%, as you know, and an expanding market size due to aging populations. Today, we have a $5 billion market leading position in electrophysiology, which grew 14% in 2024 driven by commercial execution and a significant portfolio of new product introductions from QDOT to Ultrasound, CARTO and more recently, VARIPULSE, partially offset by competitive PFA pressures, most notably here in the US. Now we've been market leader, as you know, Larry, for 20 years and have an entrenched footprint with an installed base of over 5,000 CARTO systems, which is widely recognized that the benchmark in mapping software and a broad network of highly trained mappers. And building on our success in navigation catheters and RF ablation in 2024, we launched our first PFA catheter VARIPULSE with strong initial feedback in Europe, Japan and Canada. Additionally, similar to our success in our RF portfolio, we are expanding beyond that. And we recently announced EU approval of the Dual Energy STSF catheter which is modeled on the RF STSF catheter, which historically is the most widely used ablation catheter in the world. We're also building on this and working on an Omnipulse large tip focal catheter demonstrating commitment to bring to market a comprehensive portfolio in PFA. And so I will also say, Larry, it's not just in EP, we're also moving beyond AFib and we're working to enter the Left Atrial Appendage closure market through the acquisition of Laminar which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In summary, Larry, while we're facing short-term headwinds, as you know, especially here in the US, we are absolutely confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long-term. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. I just had a two-parter on operating margins. I think you mentioned in the remarks about 150 basis points of improvement this year in process R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what's enabling that despite the lower top line growth and some of the negative product mix from STELARA. I guess, I'm trying to get at, should we be expecting OpEx to be down this year embedded in that guide? And the second part was just beyond this year. Just help us think about the cadence of margin expansion as we think about 2026 and beyond and top line reaccelerates? Thank you. Joseph Wolk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to the 150 basis improvement that wasn't related to year-on-year comparison from IPR&D. I would say that's really part and parcel to what we've been doing for a couple of years now when we had a chance to separate the consumer health business out into its own company, we did take a look at the corporate infrastructure. And as you know, we also prioritized our investments in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, specifically within those portfolios as well. So we came much more focused and you're starting to see the culmination of that this year. You might have noticed in MedTech last year, we did have some restructuring charges related to some orthopedic moves that we made, getting out of certain markets that were less profitable, improving our infrastructure around manufacturing. Those are starting to come home to roost, so to speak, in Innovative Medicine, obviously, prioritizing most of our investment into what I would call our thoroughbreds within the stable, so oncology, immunology, neuroscience, as you can tell. And we have invested in technology over the last few years in a pretty significant way. There's still more investment to come, but that's starting to yield some benefits as well in terms of efficiency around the organization. So we knew for a few years now that STELARA would face biosimilar competition. And so we had to be prepared and this is kind of how the organization has gone about it. As far as 2026 and beyond, I think, I'd go back to the comments I made with respect to operating margin and probably EPS growth overall that, that will be commensurate with sales. So that should be a positive outlook. As you know, this year, we're calling for 3% operational growth despite a multibillion dollar headwinds. Most organizations would be looking to contract both probably top and bottom line. Here we are growing 3% on the top line operationally and about 9% on the bottom line. I think you could look for maybe a little bit better equilibrium in 2026 and beyond, but with an expectation that we'd have some higher sales growth. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute, Matt. Matt, your line is now live. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. Pardon me, just make sure you hear my audio. Jessica Moore : The next analyst, please. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm on behalf of Christopher Bhutani and myself here. I wanted to come back to just the overall MedTech strategy. And I appreciate that you exited the year over the 7% number that you had previously communicated as the high end of the range. But when you pick that apart a little bit, clearly, a big percentage of that does come from M&A, I think with ex M&A, the organic number being below the 5% to 7%. So can you maybe just walk through a little bit how you think about the organic investment in the business versus inorganic contribution to that number long-term, especially when you start to look at some of the more established franchises of that surgery, orthopedics, your end market? And then if I could just sneak in accounting one in here. I just want to confirm there is no revenue recognition reversal charges in the EP numbers this quarter for VARIPULSE? Joseph Wolk : David, thank you for the question. And we could not be more thrilled with the performance that we delivered in 2024. And while there are opportunities, we delivered almost $32 billion of sales at an operational growth rate of 6.2%. When you take out impact of Shockwave, that's 4.7%. And let me be very clear that we remain very confident in our expectations communicated at the EBR. And as a reminder, we expect our end markets to grow between 5% and 7% on a weighted average basis between 22% and 27%. And we expect to deliver an operational CAGR in the upper end of the range over that period. In 2024, 6.2%, as I mentioned and we're pleased with the continued double-digit growth in cardiovascular, both within our core electrophysiology business and our new acquisitions in Abiomed and Shockwave, which I referenced earlier. We're also proud of the continuous improvements in Ortho. This is a business that historically was a laggard for MedTech, but tremendous improvements especially with the mid-single-digit growth in hips and knees and continued innovation with our enabling technologies and specifically in VELYS. We're also encouraged by the continuous improvements in vision, another core business. And as you know, we had a slower start to 2024, but we saw that improve throughout the year, culminating in operational growth rate in the fourth quarter of 9.1%. That said, as you know too well, we do have some short-term headwinds near-term competitive pressures in US. EP as one and secondly continued headwinds in China, which we've mentioned in 2025 will continue to be a headwind and we have included that in our estimates. As we look to the year ahead, we don't provide guidance by sector, as you know, but we're confident that continued growth will be driven by our tremendous portfolio of new products, specifically VARIPULSE, our TECNIS premium IOLs, ACUVUE OASYS MAX and Contact Lens, VELYS portfolio in Ortho, our STRATAFIX portfolio in barbed sutures and our broad-based hemostats in surgery. We also believe that our recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, as I mentioned earlier, will continue to perform exceptionally well fueled by multiple new products, new indications and a rapidly growing body of clinical evidence. I will say that it's important as you think about 2025 to recognize, as Joe mentioned earlier, that we expect to see an acceleration in the back half. We are seeing some tough comparators when we compare to 2024. A couple of factors will be a positive one-time change in revenue recognition in our Ortho business. Inventory builds outside of the US and electrophysiology and finally headwinds related to selling days versus prior year. And so we would recommend that you encourage you to consider these in your statements for the year ahead. And maybe, David, just to cap off, you asked a specific question around accounting reversal and whether that had any impact on the quarter. There was none related to VARIPULSE. Jessica Moore : Thanks, David, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I'll now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato : Thank you. Thank you, Jessica, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you have heard, we are ready for 2025, a year that will solidify our strength and lead to elevated performance for the balance of the decade. Enjoy the rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
