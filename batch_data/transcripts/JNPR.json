We\u2019ve extended today\u2019s call to an hour and a half in order to accommodate more questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shaygan. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on today\u2019s conference call and webcast. I joined this iconic company, because I saw a unique opportunity to optimize the organizational\u2019s phenomenal assets, deep customer relationships, great technology, and fantastic people to address our customers\u2019 most pressing needs, high performance, agile, secure, automated, context-aware networks all delivered in an open framework. It is also my belief that we can deliver improved results for our shareholders by working in a more efficient structure with greater customer connectedness and accountability for performance. These are the areas I\u2019m going to cover with you today. First, a review of our quarterly results, and second, an update on our IOP and the steps we\u2019ve taken to achieve our stated target of $160 million in annualized OpEx savings. Our quarterly financial results demonstrate that we are on our way. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered 10% revenue growth and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 21%. And we achieved this while creating our integrated operating plan and kick starting an execution. In addition, today AT&T announced that Juniper has been selected as a strategic vendor to help deliver their Domain 2.0 vision to deploy a User-Defined Network Cloud. This is an honor for our company and one I know we are all very proud of. I want to recognize our team that collaborated so well across the company in support of AT&T. Clearly, this is an exciting and important time for us as a company and I am thrilled to be on this journey with my colleagues around the world. I am pleased with our Q1 2014 results, which reflect continued momentum in the business. Importantly, our revenue was well-diversified. We saw continue demand from our service providers across Web 2.0, cable and carriers in all geographies, as well as from the Americas Enterprise customers, reflecting significant opportunity to capture share in the meaningful, high-growth segments our Cloud-Builder and High IQ networking across the globe. Robyn will give you more color on the quarter in a moment, but before she does so, let me share with you the progress we\u2019re making related to IOP. I am very impressed with the thoughtful and disciplined approach the team has taken to ensure the success of our IOP. We have already demonstrated our ability to execute quickly as one unified organization, or what we call one Juniper. I want to thank all of my colleagues around the world who have been responsible for implementing this plan and delivering the outstanding results this quarter. So, here is an update on our progress across the four dimensions of IOP. First, we have sharpened our strategic focus on the highest growth opportunities in the networking as customers migrate to best-in-class cloud environments and High IQ networks. The demand for highly scaled, sophisticated, secure, automated, context-aware networks and cloud environments requires the ensemble of agent core routing, switching, security, virtualization capabilities and network intelligence and control all working seamlessly together in an open framework. That is the value proposition that Juniper alone can offer. This strategy is focused on the continued diversification of our revenue with a deeper focus on a set of targeted customer segments that are in the build cycle for High IQ networks and cloud environments. We see four clear customer segments that fall into this category, carriers, cable, and content providers, where the network experience is fundamental to their business. Web 2.0 companies who are also at the forefront of building advanced, secure, intelligent networks. A set of enterprise customers like financial services and national governments, who are building large-scale internal clouds, and other enterprise customers who view the network as mission-critical to their business. This strategy is clearly resonating with our customers. In addition to today\u2019s announcement with AT&T, we have secured a very important design win with a major global financial services company in transforming their network for best-in-class, cloud builder, and high IQ attributes. Second, we have implemented a One-Juniper structure to create a more focused, connected, agile, and execution-oriented company centered around the fastest growing opportunities in the marketplace, where we see the market evolving too, and equally as important where we excel as an innovation driven company. So let me tell you what we\u2019ve done to execute towards the One-Juniper initiative. On the go-to-market side, we have evolved our model to one that is focused on targeted industry verticals. This is the next stage in our evolution from a geography and sector-based model. We have consolidated our advanced technology teams with a focus on being true centers of excellence around cloud building and high IQ networks. We are becoming more deliberately focused on a key set of partners who deliver these solutions and see them playing an important role in furthering our commercial business going forward. This structure allows us to be more connected to our customers than ever before to ensure we anticipate and co-create with them to meet their ever-changing needs driven by their highly dynamic end markets. I think of this as an outside-in customer imperative fused with Juniper\u2019s inside out approach to innovation. On the R&D side of the house, you will hear more from Rami shortly about the new consolidated organization positioned to capitalize on Juniper\u2019s engineering expertise across routing, switching, and security, tightly linked with our CT organization. This new consolidated R&D structure will optimize our engineering resources across product lines and leverage our products in a more holistic and differentiated fashion. Third, we are on schedule to eliminate $160 million in annualized structural costs from our operations with a clear glide path from second quarter 2014 to first quarter 2015. We have a detailed execution plan within each category of delayering, automation, and focused innovation that matters. These efficiencies will strengthen the company by focusing our resources on high growth areas of the market. Importantly, we have a governance model in place to ensure complete accountability. Our newly formed cost innovation board reporting directly to me meets regularly to ensure we stay on track with execution. We continue to work with an independent consultant to provide outside expertise as needed. And our entire leadership team is unified and fully committed to appropriately managing our cost structure. Robyn will cover our cost actions in more detail during her remarks. Fourth, in February, we introduced a new capital allocation program, which preserves flexibility for future growth while returning capital to our stockholders via buybacks and dividends. Robyn will review the progress we\u2019ve made on this program during her remarks as well. In summary, I\u2019m very confident in our integrated operating plan. The granularity of the execution plan and the level of oversight give us the confidence to achieve the goals we committed to in our IOP. Our strategy is the right one centered on meeting our customers\u2019 most pressing needs with innovation that truly matters to them. We are committed to executing on the goals set up in February, including reducing our cost base and significantly increasing our operating margin profile to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value. In closing, this is my commitment. We will remain relentlessly focused on disciplined execution and we\u2019ll continue to update you on a regular basis. Thank you for your time today. Now, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Shaygan. I would like to first share details of our new Juniper development and innovation organization or JDI, and then provide insight into the key drivers behind our first quarter results. As Shaygan discussed, a key component of the IOP is to streamline our organization and our product portfolio combining our best-of-breed products for the world-class cross-functional innovation, and solutions to solve the most challenging and most meaningful used cases for our customers. In the first quarter, we made a serious of related organizational changes to ensure our R&D and go-to-market functions are focused on cross-functional execution attainment of JDI strategy and business plan. This included merging Juniper\u2019s three product marketing teams into a single integrated marketing function and creating an integrated business operations team consolidating what was once two separate teams into a single team focused on driving JDI execution. These changes are consistent with our One-Juniper approach to reduce unnecessary complexity, increased clarity ownership, and improved efficiency. In addition, this new structure focuses our R&D resources on areas of innovation that matter most to our customers and partners high IQ networks and cloud. In short, these changes will give up the opportunity to truly focused on resources and double down on value creating technologies. For example, we have identified several pre-revenue generating project and are currently transitioning those resources and investing in technologies that matter most to our customers. Juniper remains firmly committed to our existing security, switching, and routing businesses. As Shaygan mentioned, each plays a vital role in our high IQ network and cloud builder strategy, and they areas where we excel as a company. Now, let me shift gears and share with you some insight into the performance drivers behind the first quarter results. Routing product revenue was up 7% year-over-year driven by strong performance in MX. Our increasing focus on customers building smarter networks, capable of generating faster return on their capital investment is paying off. Our MX Universal Edge continues to win in the market and this quarter we enabled many new customers with these capabilities. These customers include large carriers in North America, EMEA, APAC, and Latin America. This quarter, we will begin taking orders for the world\u2019s fastest rich IP line cards with the MX2020 clocking in at over a half of terabit per second. Core was down this quarter mostly as a result of the lumpiness of build-up by large operators, but I\u2019m pleased with current pipeline for core routing. Also, industry trends continue with service provider investment in Edge and Metro are outpacing that in core. Clearly, the MX is benefiting from that. We secured a number of new PTX logo wins in the past few weeks alone and that give us confidence in the future. In Q1, we shipped the industry\u2019s highest density packet optical solutions with new Gig-E DWDM line cards for the PTX. We had a very strong quarter in switching with product revenue up 46% year-over-year, following a 36% year-over-year growth in Q4 2013.  : During the first quarter, we had wins at top tier web services companies, large content providers, global banks, including a recent win with a major global financial services company and with high growth public cloud service providers. We\u2019re encouraged by early interest and the sales ramp of the recently introduced QFX5100 top-of-rack switch in both enterprise and service provider applications. We are making good progress in our security business. While total product security revenue was down 2% year-over-year, we are seeing continued strength in our high-end SRX business with double-digit year-over-year growth as data center consolidation and clouds drive the need for performance and scale. We remain fully committed to our security business, focusing on what matters the most of our customers and where they are spending. It\u2019s important to note that security is a critical element of, and fully aligned with our strategy and high IQ networks and cloud. We\u2019re seeing good traction with our 100 Gig-E SRX I/O Card launched in the fourth quarter of last year. Juniper remains the only Firewall on the market with 100 Gig-E connectivity leading to wins in large cloud environment. For example, in the quarter, we had a win at a major Web 2.0 company, whereas 100 Gig-E was a critical differentiator. Q1 also saw the successful introduction of new innovation to embed security in the cloud with a Firefly product suite. We closed a key win in a top financial services firm on the strength of features like high availability and better operational efficiency through automation support.  : At this point, I will turn it over to Robyn. Thank you. Robyn Denholm : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that our Q1 2014 results reflect good year-over-year revenue growth and significant continued earnings expansion. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 21%. We also continue to see strong demand signals. This sets the stage for what we expect will be continued year-over-year earnings expansion. I\u2019m very pleased with the diversity of our revenue. We saw year-over-year growth in all three geographies with good revenue growth coming from our newer target areas within both the Service Provider and Enterprise segments. We continue to see strong demand from our Web 2.0 and cable customers. The trend that we saw in 2013 has continued in the third quarter. In the quarter, revenue growth was driven by strength in our switching and routing products and continued growth in our SRX-based security products. Before I go into detail behind the results of the quarter. I would like to review the financial impacts related to our integrated operating plan. On April 2, we disclosed restructuring charges related to the cost-saving initiatives that we have begun under our IOP. In Q1, we booked $122 million of restructuring and other charges. We announced a head count reduction of approximately 6% and the vast majority of the affected employees have already been notified. In Q1, the head count related restructuring charges were $28 million. Non-cash asset write-downs of $94 million included $85 million related to the cancellation of the development of the application delivery controller technology and $8 million related to inventory. As we have stated, we are committed to achieving an annualized operating expense run rate reduction of $160 million. We are making good progress towards this target. These changes are expected to be structural. We anticipate the mix of savings to be as follows, approximately 60% related to head count savings, 20% related to program and project reductions, with the balance coming from facilities consolidation and other savings. The fiscal 2015, we expect an expense to revenue ratio of approximately 39%. Please refer to our chart in our supplemental slide deck posted to our website of our expected quarterly operating expense path over the next four quarters. In addition to our IOP cost reduction activities, during the quarter we announced robust and comprehensive capital allocation strategy. I\u2019d like to walk you through the actions we have taken, which highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow potential. As part of our commitment to return a minimum of $3 billion of capital to stockholders over the next three years. We initiated $1.2 billion accelerated stock repurchase program of which $900 million worth of shares were initially delivered in Q1. We also raised $350 million of debt, allowing us to fund the ASR in a way that is consistent with our liquidity policy. Now I would like to move into a discussion with the Q1 results. Looking at our demand metrics, we begin the second quarter with a very healthy backlog. Our book-to-bill in Q1 was slightly below one, which is typical of our Q1 trends. Product bookings were healthy with a year-over-year growth rate exceeding the revenue growth rate. Total deferred revenue was up $174 million year-over-year and $85 million sequentially. Product deferred revenue was down $14 million sequentially, due primarily to lower channel inventory. Total revenue was $1,170 million, up 10% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline is in line with our typical seasonal pattern. Product revenue was up 12% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Services revenue was $294 million, up 6% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter reflecting the continued diversity of our business. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22. We recorded a GAAP restructuring charge of $122 million, which resulted in $0.25 impact on GAAP earnings. This was offset by a $0.33 gain from the sale of minority equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29, up $0.05 year-over-year and down $0.14 sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and operating margins. In the quarter, we had a positive impact from the reduced share count of about $0.01. Now, let me provide color on revenue by region, market, and product area. All regions reflected year-over-year revenue growth. Overall, Americas revenue was up 15% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As a reminder, our service provider revenue includes carrier, cable, and Web 2.0 customers. Americas enterprise increased 22% year-over-year and declined 15% sequentially. The strong year-on-year growth was led by federal and financial services. EMEA revenue was up 2% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. Of note, we saw strong year-on-year performance in the German and UK market. APAC increased 9% year-over-year and decreased 16% sequentially. These results reflect service provider growth year-over-year in both Korea and Australia. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $783 million, down 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year with growth across all three geographies. Enterprise revenue was $387 million, down 13% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year due to broad-based strength in the Americas and public sector spending in EMEA and APAC. Now, let me review our revenue by product area. Routing product revenue was $550 million, down 11% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Revenue was driven by strong performance in MX, while the new MX2000 series and the MX104 continue to gain traction and experience solid growth sequentially. This growth was offset by a decline in T-series revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year. Total switching product revenue was $192 million, up 46% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially from a record Q4 2013. This was driven by strong sales of both EX and QFabric product families. And we are pleased with demand for both areas. Total security product revenue was $134 million, down 15% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. This is due to the continued decline of the oldest ScreenOS products and non-Junos-based products now represent less than 15% of our security revenue. The SRX products grew 13% year-over-year, led by good growth in the high-end SRX. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 63.5% compared to 64.2% last quarter and 64.6% a year-ago. The sequential decline was largely due to a decrease in services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.8%, down one-tenth of a point from last quarter and seven-tenths of a point from a year-ago. The sequential decrease reflects anticipated lower volume, whilst the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to mix. While the pricing environment remains competitive, we remain focused on innovation and cost improvements in our supply chain. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 59.7%, down 2.2 points sequentially and down 2.4 points year-over-year. The declines are related to high support costs and increased spares. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $542 million, about what we anticipated due to an increase in legal costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.2% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.5 points due to higher revenue offset by lower gross margins. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.6% compared to 18.8% last quarter. This change is primarily due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit and one-time items that were reflected in the prior quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 25.3% compared to 18% in Q4. The increases is primarily due to the net gain on the sale of minority equity investments and the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. This is partially offset by the impact of restructuring other charges. Looking at the balance sheet, we made substantial progress on our commitment to return capital to our stockholders. During the quarter, 33.3 million shares under the ASR program were initially delivered and retired for an aggregate purchase price of $900 million. These actions reduced the average diluted share count to 497 million, down by 9 million shares sequentially. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of net cash and investments. Net cash declined by approximately $1 billion sequentially, primarily due to the ASR. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of $126 million, down sequentially due to the seasonally lower income and annual payments for incentive comp. Onshore cash and investments represented 29% of total growth balance. In line with recent trend, DSO was 46 days and capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $46 million. Now, let\u2019s look at our outlook for Q2 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As demonstrated in our recent results, we are executing well and the assets we are making to drive further execution improvements are taking hold. We see underling demand in the markets we serve is healthy and we expect to continue the year-over-year expansion in earnings. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,200 million to $1,230 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64% plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $520 million, plus or minus $5 million, and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our cost reduction commitments. Operating margins are expected to be a healthy 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. And this is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.36 and $0.39 per share assuming a share count of approximately $480 million. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter. As a reminder and as previously disclosed in Q2 and throughout the rest of this year, we expect to book additional restructuring charges, the majority of which will be related to facility and other asset write-downs. To summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy, and our product portfolio continues to be strong. We are very focused on executing on our integrated operating plan and continuing to drive innovation. Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group : Hi, thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. Could you clarify in your OpEx guidance about 20% of the cost savings coming from actions taken to programs and projects. Have those actions already been announced and how should we think about any associated revenue growth impact from those cuts? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes, Stephen for Brian, thanks for the question. We have a very deterministic glide path that we shared with you, and we track these \u2013 our cost saving cuts very rigorously almost on a weekly basis. We have taken a lot of the actions, it\u2019s actually front loaded, and \u2013 but the savings of these will come \u2013 the actions are taken, but the savings will come through the second quarter and the third quarter. Most of the head count related cuts have been already taken and we\u2019ve executed those. They will come \u2013 some of them already done, some of them will take longer, because they are in regions which just takes longer to get off payroll. And let me see if Robyn, you want to say anything else on that? Robyn Denholm : No, I think you answered the question well. Thanks, Shaygan. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes, good afternoon. A few if I may, Could we just parse out that legal expense and what costs would have been in the quarter without it and how much is recurring? I think that will help lend visibility to your plan and credibility behind that cadence you have on the slide. And then also Shaygan, if you could just talk about the sustainability of the switching momentum, what are you really seeing there and how sustainable is it, because obviously 46%. I think that need everybody\u2019s model for the second quarter in a row. And what you see in the competitive dynamics there? Thanks a lot. Shaygan Kheradpir : Sure, Ben. So the first question I\u2019ll ask also Robyn determine. Most of the upward pressure we saw on the first quarter was due to legal on G&A. I will ask her to parse that I suffice it to say before I pass the Robyn. And then I\u2019ll come back on the switching. Is that we are committed and we see our way clearly to the $160 million cost cuts as laid out in that charts that we have published between now and first quarter 2015, quarter-by-quarter. So for example we would be at $520 million in second quarter and $510 million in the third quarter and less than $500 million the first quarter 2015. We are quite clearly to that we\u2019ve got most of the actions front loaded and executing. So, you shouldn\u2019t worry about the 160. And in terms of the legal. I\u2019ll pass it to Robyn and then I\u2019ll come back on switching. Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Shaygan. In terms of the legal expenses that Shaygan mentioned they were above what we were expecting for the quarter. If you look at the G&A increase quarter-over-quarter a substantial is $7 million to $8 million. And the majority of that in fact more than that increase is due to legal in the quarter. Some of which was expected and some of which wasn\u2019t as I mean in prepared remarks. If you look year-over-year in terms of OpEx, we have been making progress and that is in pre-out recently announced actions that we have been taking. So, if you look at our OpEx is a total as a percentage of revenue is about 46.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014 versus 48.9% for last year. So, we have been making some progress even though the legal expenses did increase more than we were anticipating in the quarter. Shaygan Kheradpir : And if I can, thanks Robyn. I\u2019ll take the switching. Obviously, we had, we are very pleased with the switching quarter. I can tell you and I have been engaged since I have been here with a lot of conversions with the customers of what they are doing, why they are doing and specially in regard to switching. It\u2019s actually quite fascinating. It\u2019s a lot around Cloud-Builder and is putting in place our switching with our routing and security as an ensemble and our controller and Contrail into sort of many accounts. Now, every single one of them that I have been engaged, if you\u2019re actually sophisticated implementations and each company is doing something quite interesting. And so that is also lend itself very well to Juniper\u2019s DNA on sitting with the customers and cranking. So, they love features in Cloud-Building like in service software upgrade that\u2019s a fantastic feature do you love. They love things like micro-bursting, which gives them lot of telemetry and very fine-grained levels. They love the fact that they can write get the on some switches. And on and on and on. And they like the fact that they are open, high for scale with sort of no extra package and they can do a lot of things that each of them once they are slightly differently. And the fact they work very well with MX and SRX.  : Rami Rahim :  Yes, I think you covered most of it, I\u2019d just say that the team has been working really hard over the last year and so when we consolidated our switching organization we streamline, simplified our portfolio and we implemented as number of capabilities from fabric technologies, IQ and a number of different things that Shaygan mentioned has made our portfolio including switching, routing and security really appealing to both enterprise and service provider. Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes, I would just say one other thing, its Rami hit as a nail on the head where the leverage engineering between routing and switching actually quite phenomenal and why customers buy in a switching it\u2019s not your grandfathers switch and security is your grandfathers, this is a new world and all the leverage engineering we are getting from Junos really giving us a leg up and of course open net derivatives since you talk about. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay great. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi Group. Please go ahead. Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: : Shaygan you mentioned the pre-revenue projects that you are getting rid off and of course that you are trimming the cost structure, you are finding a number of these, can you give us some example beside from the right opt for the riverbed deal, where you can give us best example and that\u2019s things you have gotten out of, so we can understand this kind of put a red basket box, whatever targets around kind of understand the different areas, that you are getting about, and identify any other areas kind of that you can that you think you still might be looking toward. And then finally Robyn again it\u2019s been at the legal thing and again, brought up last conference call and then it\u2019s brought up here again. But can we just be specific in terms of what was the actual legal amount this quarter? what we are expecting I know there was some controversies last quarter on whether its $15 million this quarter you expecting from legal. So we assume that it was $15 million plus 7 to 8 you actually spent $23 million this quarter on legal. But you expected $15 million if you are going to just give us the Q1 legal where that goes in Q2. So we can compare, what that looks like in Q2, and just levels that us a Q4 number as well and that\u2019s a lot, but that really it\u2019s kind of set that bar as to what\u2019s the ups and downs in legal and kind of how that is falling through those three quarters, that would be, great. Thanks.  : Shaygan you mentioned the pre-revenue projects that you are getting rid off and of course that you are trimming the cost structure, you are finding a number of these, can you give us some example beside from the right opt for the riverbed deal, where you can give us best example and that\u2019s things you have gotten out of, so we can understand this kind of put a red basket box, whatever targets around kind of understand the different areas, that you are getting about, and identify any other areas kind of that you can that you think you still might be looking toward. And then finally Robyn again it\u2019s been at the legal thing and again, brought up last conference call and then it\u2019s brought up here again. But can we just be specific in terms of what was the actual legal amount this quarter? what we are expecting I know there was some controversies last quarter on whether its $15 million this quarter you expecting from legal. So we assume that it was $15 million plus 7 to 8 you actually spent $23 million this quarter on legal. But you expected $15 million if you are going to just give us the Q1 legal where that goes in Q2. So we can compare, what that looks like in Q2, and just levels that us a Q4 number as well and that\u2019s a lot, but that really it\u2019s kind of set that bar as to what\u2019s the ups and downs in legal and kind of how that is falling through those three quarters, that would be, great. Thanks. , : Shaygan you mentioned the pre-revenue projects that you are getting rid off and of course that you are trimming the cost structure, you are finding a number of these, can you give us some example beside from the right opt for the riverbed deal, where you can give us best example and that\u2019s things you have gotten out of, so we can understand this kind of put a red basket box, whatever targets around kind of understand the different areas, that you are getting about, and identify any other areas kind of that you can that you think you still might be looking toward.

Thanks. Robyn Denholm : And Ehud I think that was like 18 questions rising there but \u2026 Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: It was three main topics broken down to a category part\u2026 Shaygan Kheradpir : I know, I know I am just kidding, I am just kidding yes, yes. So on AT&T as I am sure you are familiar to have this program called domain 2.0 which is called the user defined network cloud. And essentially they are pushing their network into the next phase which is around clouds and it\u2019s around a lot of attributes of the cloud. So what are those attributes they obviously, is a carrier class nature of it which you are very good at Fort Knox security which is very, very good at. Multi tendency and in terms of the high IQ piece of it it\u2019s a lot around automation for efficiency and effectiveness in terms of virtualization and so forth and so on. Service chaining, traffic movements a lot of STN, so a lot of the attributes that you put together to create a modern cloud based architectures they have been very clear this is what they want. And they \u2013 we are very fortunate to be sort of selected for these attributes. And we have by the way products in all of these categories and they work and they work very well each other. So and I believe, I don\u2019t know this to be a fact but I believe that would a first re-routing and a supplier announced I don\u2019t know but that\u2019s so I think we\u2019re very pleased with that. What was the other question? Robyn Denholm : Some of the project that we might be investing from, Rami has that. Shaygan Kheradpir : Right. So, I\u2019ll pass it on to Rami so, and he can go more but, I would just say that with high IQ looked at our product lines are very carefully through operated charge, in terms of return on investment, in terms of the match to cloud builder on high IQ our strategy, so fact that to say we are focusing on growth and we are focusing on accretive work that matters to our customers. And based on that we have \u2013 you saw decision on ADC and as far as normal course of business we do continuous mark-to-market to evaluate our products and projects. And we are transitioning our portfolio to technologies that match our strategy and on our workforce and where can get leverage engineering Rami do you want to say a few more words on that. Rami Rahim : I\u2019ll just add that, we on an ongoing basis are always in the process of evaluating the ROI expectations the market conditions of all of our project and making decisions based on this analysis. And the IOP was really no exception to that we did take a look across the board of all of our projects and we did identify a number of pre-revenue generating projects that we will transition resources off of and to put them on projects that are more highly aligned if you will with our strategy things like STN and NFB like many of our forward thinking customers are thinking about today and on legal Robyn. Robyn Denholm : Yes. Let me just add on the project side, the projects we evaluate with not just R&D Rami went through some of the R&D projects. We\u2019ve also evaluated other projects that we\u2019ve been doing on the infrastructure side within the company as well and some of those will, I\u2019ve seen targeted for completion or preparation if you like as well. So it\u2019s an across-the-board review of our project, across all three of the areas. So specific to legal, I\u2019m not going to give you the dollar amount, but I will point you to the G&A line that you can see in the press release and on the various filings that we\u2019ve done. And what you can see that G&A is up significantly year-over-year, it\u2019s 39% year-over-year increase, and the legal expense increase is more or less the entire increase. So you can say that it is \u2013 has been a large amount. Having said that as Shaygan mentioned, we are committed to achieving the $160 million of cost reductions on an annualized basis exiting Q1 of next year. Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. And we are co-listing all our resources around driving profitable growth and connecting report and growth. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Next question Manny? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, guys, two questions, maybe just a follow-up on your earlier switching question, but given some of the cloud momentum and big wins you mentioned on the call, do you think Q1 is a new base off of which we should see sustainable sequential growth moving forward, or would you expect some lumpiness there? And then I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the dynamics driving the uptick in support costs and spares that impacted service margin in the period, when you think about the likely range of service margin moving forward. Should we be thinking about numbers getting back into the 61% to 63% range, we\u2019ve seen over the last few years or should we expect service margin to remain closer to current levels? Thanks. Shaygan Kheradpir : Sure. I will pass this question. The first one is about forward momentum on cloud building. Just suffice it to say that we \u2013 we are pleased with the momentum and the pipeline of what we see. Rami, do you want to give some more color to that? Rami Rahim : Yes, I would be happy to, thanks, Jess. So as you know, our Switching business has an enterprise component where we are selling to enterprise, IT, private cloud and data center, machine critical campus combination, as well as service provider applications, including things like cloud data center intra-POP infrastructure connectivity, certain parts of access infrastructure. And I have said in the past that especially the service provider components of that business can be lumpy. In Q1 we actually saw strength in both enterprise and service provider. So can you expect this level of performance going forward, I would say that\u2019s probably unrealistic. Our goal is to continue to take market share and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to do so. Shaygan Kheradpir : And, Robyn, do you want to take that. Robyn Denholm : Yes, so in terms of the services gross margin Jess, the gross margin in the quarter was 59.7%, it has been quite some quarter since we\u2019ve been below 60%. And the reason for that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that the support costs were higher in the quarter and we also had increased bearing. We normally get increasing bearing when we have our new customers or new contracts or new product introduction. And so the timing of those do vary from time to time in terms of when we get those spares on board. So we do expect the services gross margin to improve from this low level of 59.7% in the quarter. Kathleen Nemeth : Great. Next question please Manny? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Hi, thank you very much and happy to be back in business. Could I ask a couple of questions, one is from a high-level? There has been some talk about our core routing refresh cycle and I think talk about some of the carriers running hot. There seems to be now, your commentary was more focused on growth from the edge than the core. If you could sit some light on that I would to be delighted. And then Robyn for you, could you clarify a little bit lower products deferred revenue outlook, the channel is that driven by seasonality is that driven by a pullback from certain areas of business what goes into that reduction in the channel? Thank you. Shaygan Kheradpir : Okay, on the first one I\u2019ll ask Rami to comment the hedge dynamic versus the core dynamics, which is obviously different. And can you just focus on the core please. Rami Rahim : Sure, thanks Jeff. But you\u2019re right the strength we saw on routing was primarily back in the hedge and primarily driven by our MX product line. And that\u2019s essentially a play out of the strategy that we have been developing on the MX product line around the universal edge. So, in carriers and service providers are looking to consolidate their services onto fewer networks and to provide virtualization to enable business residential in video and mobile type services, we really have a fantastic weapon to compete within the form of the MX. On the core, you\u2019re right core was in fact down, I think the biggest things that we saw in Q1 was primarily that of lumpiness in spending and in the builder. I say that because if you take a look at Q4 of last year, the core investment was actually quite okay. And then if you look at our pipeline if you will. They\u2019re again I think what you see somewhat encouraging. There is in fact also an industry trend, which we had mentioned in the past where the bulk of the investments and routing is still happening in the edge and in the metro. And that of course is putting pressure on those parts of the network the edge and the metro, which the MX benefits from and to some extent it can elevate some of the pressure from the core. So that might push out the need for investments in the core of it. The best thing that Juniper can do in a situation like this is to execute on a high leverage R&D strategy for a product that satisfied both market segments edge and core and to be ready for the cycle irrespective of where it actually start to occur. Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Thank you, Rami and Robyn you want to talk about deferred revenue question? Robyn Denholm : Yes, Jeff in terms of the channel inventory, it is typically the case in our Q1 that there is a seasonal reduction in the inventory. But I would also so we had a strong channel quarter as well. So a strong finish all the way through to the end of the quarter through the channel. And as Shaygan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are doing a lot of business with our channel partners in terms of particularly on the enterprise, but also on the service provider area as well. And so we have a strong focus on partnering and on the channel so. And the inventory volumes will lower as we exhibit the quarter. Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Thanks. Kathleen Nemeth :  Okay, great. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv R. Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Thanks so much. Two questions, perhaps if you look at the router outlook right now versus a year ago. I just wondering if you guys could make a comment on sort of how things stand now versus a year ago. And as far as the cost of announced in early April. Any color on where they happened and specifically what product areas where impacted that most in those cuts? Thanks. Shaygan Kheradpir : Sure, Sandeep. So again I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll pass them to my colleagues here. So on routing, what\u2019s going on I\u2019ll give you the top-level dynamic as I see them. First of all you\u2019ve got obviously that \u2013 well everybody knows which is the bandwidth growth, which is driven really by mobile and content concentrated by video, there is pressure there. Now that actually that pressure people usually think about it in the carrier networks spread \u2013 it splashes also into data centers and clouds and also some interesting ways. So that\u2019s an end-to-end pressure and routing is very much front and center on both ends of this. Then you\u2019ve got Rami mentioned, the second one is convergences and convergence is in two forms, one is on the access sides, that\u2019s things like P&G and then there is now finally a good move towards wireless and wireline network convergence and when that happens and you\u2019ve got the beautiful machine called MX which is right at the front center and PTX. And then the key part of this is more and more every month that passes, we all are getting stuff as a service that is an undeniable fact and that \u2013 to do that you need to build this giant cloud systems and High IQ networks a lot of the attributes we\u2019ve been talking about and there it\u2019s much more a layer 3 discussion and as soon as you have layer 3 discussions, you land on routing, you land on routing, you land on MX, PTX and T series and all the rich, both the rich functionality on the agents, there is so many, we can\u2019t even count and then super high scale at the core. And so all of these three things we don\u2019t see that these pressures are abating relative to last year. Rami do you want to sort of give the overview on it? Rami Rahim : The only thing I\u2019ll add Shaygan is that if I look at service provider again with that definition of web services and telco and cable then the market in fact should be a healthy market for us in this year. So it really comes down to the competitiveness of our products and our ability to actually go and satisfy the pressures that they are seeing and that\u2019s where I\u2019d just reiterate that I\u2019m actually quite confident in product and the technology that we have in the market and what\u2019s coming up in the roadmap. Shaygan Kheradpir : Very good, so as far as the second question was around cost cuts right? Yes, so the cost cuts I would say all of them will make our company stronger going forward because they are around taking bureaucracy out, delayering the organization, the duplicating repetitive effort and as fact, so basically all of those that aren\u2019t closed about, our customers like its grade I can go directly back to back with your best people be it on go to market and engineering. Its going sort of back to way it was in a bigger fashion, so that\u2019s good. The biggest leverage is actually amongst all it. Its not that they have put teams together for example in engineering there is all sorts of leverage work that we can get across the board in one \u2013 one are in the organization as an example. And sharpen your focus on things that matter which is on cloud building and High IQ and things frankly that we are not going to focus on either because its not really our core competency, or its not where the market is going and we\u2019re going to focus on growth. So that really their focus and the cost cuts I\u2019m certain of it, they are going to make the company stronger going forward for the following reasons. There is a lot of work, its not only in R&D, in go to market having focused on those verticals that are in the business of cloud building, High IQ networks and where our networks are mission critical and little deepening relationship putting our entire portfolio in play, in interesting ways to take share, more valid share out of those accounts. And then be a little bit deliberate on partners much more much deliberately partnered dependent, and then the whole organization is one Juniper focused on the strategy. So the cost cuts should really be viewed in that way that they that out there \u2013 they will actually make the company stronger. Robyn, do you want to say anything? Robyn Denholm :  No I think you\u2019ve covered a lot. Also earlier in the Q&A Rami went through that in R&D we had cut some projects like the agency that were non-revenue generating and therefore and not aligned. So there was a thorough review done in terms of both projects that would not revenue generating and also not aligned with the cloud builder in High IQ strategy, and so the teams has done a very good job on executing and spacing those types of projects as well. Shaygan Kheradpir :  It\u2019s not accretive and it\u2019s not aligned to the strategy and its not leverage engineering, it doesn\u2019t really survive. Kathleen Nemeth :  Okay, great. Next question please, Manny. Operator : Thank you. The next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: I had a couple of questions on the cost side and on the revenue side as well. So first on the cost side I think you talked about some cuts and consolidation you did in R&D operations and marketing, or there any outflow cuts to sales? Robyn Denholn : Yes, they were Simona, there is cuts in sales and marketing as well, in fact if you look at our slide deck, we put the glide path in there from Q4 of 2013 quarterly OpEx and we\u2019ve also put a chart that shows by area, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. What we expect the profile of our go forward OpEx to be and again the profile from where we are coming from which is the Q4 2013 numbers versus the Q1 2015 estimates that we have in terms of the post IOP, post 116 reduction on an annualized basis. And so there are cuts across the board, G&A, R&D, and sales and marketing. Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes. Of course in G&A Simona there is operation. Robyn side exactly right on the sales front, we really are focusing both on service provider and enterprise those segments that we mentioned. We are gathering our forces around those segments, so they can go deeper and more focused and frankly all those customers sets they want the same things that, for example in AT&T and Verizons which is depth and with a lot of technical hands on skills. And so that\u2019s really the sales motion and getting that focus will also gives us synergies which is in another way of what Rami is doing win, he is doing go to market, Rami is doing good to get the leverage on engineering and making sure we\u2019re focused on cloud building and high IQ network. So you should think of it more as a focus on debt and leverage rather than, sort of cuts that weaken you. Kathleen Nemeth : And Simona, do you have a follow-up question as well. Manny, can you open the line again for Simona, I believe Simona had a follow-up. Operator : Sorry, and just one moment. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thank you very much. Yes, I did have a follow-up question on the revenue side, so you talked about de-emphasizing or cutting some of the resources for three revenue project, does that imply that you are still focusing on some early revenue projects like Junos Pulse, the wireless LAN business, and the access business. And really the bigger picture question here I\u2019m trying to get to is, you\u2019ve given us a lot of hopeful detail on the cost saving side, but as we tried to think about what is the sustainable revenue growth profile for Juniper now with this set of businesses in the next two to three years, how should we think about that and part of the missing piece is that we don\u2019t really know if you\u2019re still pursuing some of the enterprise edge on access kind of businesses that I just mentioned? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes, Simona, this is Shaygan again. I would just summarize that we are not providing competitive information on this call. So that sort of point number one, we are not drilling into that zone. On the cuts, the cuts are structural, they will remain with us. And in fact, this is a muscle that the organization is building, which is good, we can always get more efficient all the time and we will leave it at that. And when we have more news about anything in terms of products, we will share with you. But right now suffice it to say, we\u2019re focused on Cloud Builder and High IQ. And, Rami, do you want to say anything else there? Rami Rahim : No, I think that summarizes it. I will just \u2013 I just want to reiterate what I 100% committed towards switching or routing and our security businesses. I think we got a great team, great technology, fantastic roadmap, and now one that is very highly aligned with our forward looking strategy with Cloud Builder and High IQ. Robyn Denholm : Yes, and I just want to remind you as well that, the integrated operating plan is about also focusing on the top line revenue growth. It\u2019s not just about cost reductions. We\u2019re talking a lot about cost reductions today, because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve unveiled our glide path and the detail of the cost reductions. But what \u2013 we\u2019re about is actually growing and expanding our operating margins and our earnings over time. And we know that to do that we have to invest in the right innovations and the right market that really our customers need and want. And that will actually ultimately drive our revenue growth as well, which we\u2019ve been doing very well over the last six quarters or so in terms of revenue growth. Kathleen Nemeth : Great. Thank you. Manny, next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark McKecknie of Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark McKecknie \u2013 Evercore Partners : Great, thanks. Hi, Shaygan and crew, I appreciate you get me in here. So a couple of questions, one, last quarter your router orders were pretty strong up 20% quarter-on-quarter, 30% year-on-year. So looking at the near-term and the context of your guidance, it looks like about 5% sequential at the midpoint, and we heard a lot of comments on the Switching business, would you expect a little bit of growth next quarter, quarter-on-quarter for routers, what type of margin impact that might have on the mix? And then the second question is on the AT&T award, first off congratulations on that, but I wanted to know, who you competed against their. It sound like this is more for sort of public cloud business as opposed to some of the NFP. I want to understand that and I\u2019m assuming this is QFabric in some of your Contrail on a controller. But on that front, are you going to work with someone else\u2019s controller VMware someone else or is this a full QFabric and Contrail type solution? Thanks Shaygan Kheradpir :  Sure, first thanks for congratulating us on the AT&T. We are all very excited about that. And by the way, on the AT&T question you should reach after them about that this scope of it. Suffice it to say it\u2019s a material and it\u2019s really that Domain 2.0 kind of work that they\u2019ve been talking about. As far as routing is concerned, the pipeline, the design wins and the backlog, they are all pleased with those numbers for routing. And as both Rami and Robyn was said there is a different dynamics between edge and the core and the lumpiness of the core and they are out in the first quarter and all the activity around hedge that is happening under first quarter. But the pipeline we are pleased both from pipeline and design wins and the backlog on routing anything else Rami you want to add that. Robyn Denholm : I\u2019ll just add for Rami, don\u2019t forget that last year in Q2. We had a sizable amount of our enterprise routing with the government customers. So just there in mind with that when you look at our result. Having said that, we are very pleased with the strength of routing particularly in the service provider space in terms of pipeline and design wins that we have as Shaygan mentioned. So, we are actually expecting Q2 on the service provider side to improve in terms of routing in the second quarter. Shaygan Kheradpir : I would just agree with that. I would say I\u2019d expect continue to strength in our edge portfolio and keep in mind that we are continually enhancing these product offering itself that we are starting to take orders now for new line cards that\u2019s going to give us a real good performance increase in addition to new software capabilities. On enterprise routing was actually good for us in Q1 and I see a good pipeline there. And then finally I provided some commentary on the core, the pipeline for the core coupled with some wins that we\u2019ve had recently in our PTX, in fact it\u2019s our brand new logo for us. Are going to start to pay off now is that going to happen this quarter or the next quarter is difficult to say usually there is a certification cycle that takes a good couple of quarters, maybe even three quarters to play out. But based on all of that, all of the above I said have pretty good confidence in Q2. Mark McKecknie \u2013 Evercore Partners : Gotcha, thanks. Shaygan nothing on the competitive front for this AT&T, when I guess will find out? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yeah, I mean, I should really situate \u2013 I don\u2019t have average ability like that all I can say is the engagement with them has been fantastic and very forward looking across the board all the things. There was a question I think also about Contrail and I don\u2019t want to talk about anyone specific customer, but I will say that network function virtualization is a very hot topic today as many of you already know. We\u2019re engaging with the number of our customers on that topic and showing them proof-of-concepts of technology that we have that essentially couple. Our high performance services on the edge, on the MX, for example, along with the layer 4 to layer 7 service is that virtualize on general-purpose processors. Now that solution has to be nicely coupled together and provided in a way provide seamless service experience across both physical and virtual and Contrail plays a fundamental role in that. So Contrail now in fact over just a past short period of time has gone into life deployments and we have gone to probably around 2 to 3 dozen engagements and live trials with some customers around the world. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, great. Next question please Manny. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Hi, thank you ask couple of quick questions on your security segment. This is a segment that has been quite volatile although we are seeing year-over-year trends improve. I was wondering if this is a segment that you actually believe can grow in 2014, particularly when we are hearing greater competitive pressure from companies like a F5, particularly in the service provider community. And I also wondered on Shaygan do you requiring incremental investments in this part of the business and can you support that given all the OpEx rationalization that you\u2019re doing? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes, thank you for the question. So, I\u2019ll go through it. The quick version of the answer is that yes, we expect our security to grow year-over-year, now what I have to tell you is securities are paramount importance to our strategy, because you can\u2019t really as I said have a cloud be a Cloud Builder and not have security. In fact, it\u2019s much more important than before. We are pleased with our performance and growth in our SRX and Firewall both in enterprise as well as on service provider, we have as you know decline in our ScreenOS, the declines are \u2013 we had 6 ScreenOS flagship design, it was 20% of the base in that 15%, so that\u2019s diminishing. As you said correctly it is, I would believe it is stabilizing it is too be minus 18%, minus 7%, minus 2% year-over-year and we expected to return to growth by the end of this year. Having said all that we are not satisfied of where we are and we need to execute better, we acknowledge that and now that we have security in, are coming R&D team. I think we are going to get a much better leverage engineering and with everything else we have. And as you well know security market is changing, security is moving into the core, cloud, security is virtualizing everywhere else. Security is in desperate needs of high analytics. Because when you have a cloud and High IQ networking have a lot of valuable assets in it. And so having analytics to defend especially against things like military spider attack is very important. And of course you have to and need to have high efficacy. And we have a lot of capabilities, now we have to execute better they all under one R&D organization and that\u2019s our focus is to return back to year-over-year growth. Rami, do you want to say anything else on that? Rami Rahim : I will just add, we saw a great growth in the high end, that direct double digit growth and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident that the result of a lot of really hard work had gone into improving the session scale, the performance, the efficacy of that solution something that we are proud of and I think we demonstrated what we can do, when we focused on the rest of the portfolio and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re in the process of doing right now. And it\u2019s going on the last thing as I says that there will be a high leverage approach to doing so. The work that we\u2019ve done in the high end absolutely applicable for the rest of our portfolio. Kathleen Nemeth :  Next question please. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, hi guys thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up question on earlier question and then other one for Shaygan. So I just wanted to see if Robyn or Rami you guys would give us the order volume growth rate for routers in Q1. And then kind of related to that and that $471 million of backlog exceeding the year. And I know you don\u2019t usually get that number, except for the Q4, but it sounds like I mean your book-to-bill is such as just slightly less than one, is it right to think you\u2019re carrying pretty much as similar level of backlog on its Q2. And then for Shaygan, I just Shaygan could you comment on, I think you made comment before about how you\u2019re reallocating technical resources for large accounts and trying to just get more effective the way you put together Juniper\u2019s product range when you talk to these big accounts or looking at architecture. I just wondered if you could comment on how far through that you are and whether you have learned anything from those changed engagement levels with some of those accounts? Thanks. Robyn Denholm : So, Rod. I\u2019ll start on the order booking commentary. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the order booking overall for the company was higher then our revenue growth and that\u2019s very good thing for Q1 actually. And as you know typically when we are going into the next quarter a lot of the backlog is our routing products. And so, as Shaygan mentioned earlier that is one of the reasons why we are confident in our routing in a pipeline, because we have visibility to that we also have visibility to the design wins and we have a very good portfolio in terms of routing across the board as Rami mentioned. So, I think that answers your question with that our overall bookings rate was higher than our revenue growth in the quarter. Shaygan Kheradpir : And Rod, on your second question. Yes, I have embedded deep personally with our teams in many of these accounts that\u2019s have been here across all those segments that we mentioned. And I have tell you, once your are underground and you see the action and you see all the interesting workloads and very new and non-linear workloads that our customers are trying to handle and the problems were trying to solve on the innovation side, on the quality side revenue generation, automation and like it is absolutely paramount that we have our in the best and brightest teams on go-to-market on operations on technical and engineering shoulder-to-shoulder with them. And so this now have you heard this saying, people have heard me to say this before have been through. These cycles, when we are going through non linearity or inflection points in tech. We are absolutely going through one of this five years from now history if is a judge we normalize and then we can go normal formations and every can do there little bits and brigade can begin of delivery. This is not one of those times if you sit in with the cloud providers, Web 2.0, carriers and so forth and so on cable, financial services and the like. They are trying to solve stuff that frankly they had never seen before in terms of sophistication, complexity, scale, why is that the case is because everything is more as a service delivered to the end market continuously and that requires a different level of scale and sophistication and every company has a different starting point, every company has a different enduser market that they are trying to satisfy. Every company is trying to get an edge in this new world that they all see. And so being in force and in-depth in these companies to ensure you don\u2019t miss those nuances and we can execute on them and normalize those features in your product line is absolutely crucial. Now the great news about Juniper is this is what Juniper is. They are a builder company by DNA, so it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for all of us in Juniper to engage and grow up our sleeves. And I have to tell you I\u2019m having a fantastic time being at the shop floor of all these accounts and it\u2019s phenomenal what\u2019s going on, on the ground. I\u2019ve been in this business almost 30 years in networking and this reminds me of the days when I first came out of college and I saw this, it\u2019s very cool, it\u2019s very exciting, it\u2019s very sophisticated, and the world out there really desperate to meet all these innovations that we are an increasingly in place to deliver and to do that you have to have different skill and know-how and be able to take customers from one side of the river to the other side and build a bridge for them. So, yes, long answer to your question. We are super excited to Juniper about this opportunity. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, great. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research : Hi, guys. I have a couple of questions if I could. First, in terms of the cutbacks in R&D, do you worry about any of those cutbacks impacting some of your next generation ASIC developments for your kind of a MX PTX products coming out next year? Second, can you talk about kind of work here in the STN framework what your least fine strategy is, do you plan, right now is 110 gig switches, top-of-rack switches that are driving your revenues? What\u2019s your strategy on 1040, can you talk a little bit about that please? Thank you. Shaygan Kheradpir : Sure. So let me assure you, we are not cutting any muscle out of R&D that matters to our strategy and to our customers, in fact, it\u2019s the opposite. We are focusing our forces around a set of things that we think truly matter and we\u2019re putting all the force rather than be distributed and distracted. So we should view IOP as a focus on sort of big things that matter, and obviously ASIC know that you just mentioned is one of them. On the switching side I have Rami chime in, obviously we cannot give competitive information, where we\u2019re going. But I can tell you what the customers tell me about their switching line is that it already has a lot of capabilities like I mentioned in service software upgrade micro bursting, Virtual Chassis, which people love and so forth and so on. And in terms of its fees and feeds, Rami, do you want to take that? Rami Rahim : Yes, sure. First, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Shaygan said about R&D from the guidance running R&D, it\u2019s pretty much most of the cuts we\u2019ve made for structural nature were a result of the decomplexifying if you will the organization streamlining things so I am not concerned our ability to compete. And in fact you mentioned silicon, I am very excited about the silicon roadmap that we had in the works right now in Juniper. On the FDN framework in fact part of the reason why you\u2019re seeing the growth that we have right now in switching is preciously because of the fact that we are building a set of switching building blocks. These are building blocks that have a number of different applications, the data center and cloud automation being a very important used case. So, we are building directly into our switches the kinds of automation, visibility, controllability and very importantly open this there are customers absolutely like. And that give us the ability to work with great partners like VMware, where we are going in addressing private cloud like virtualization environment for many of our customers, but also with contrail, where for example in public cloud scenarios or in network function virtualization. There is a really nice seamless if you will tie in between the controller and our switches. This is very much a 10-gig story today, but the products were offering are all 10-gig, 40-gig and there is in fact going to be this migration overtime to 40-gig. So work that well setup to take advantage of that 10-gig to 40-gig migration that\u2019s happening in the market. Kathleen Nemeth :  Okay, great. And we do have time for couple of more questions. We\u2019re coming up on the hour so operator next question please. Operator : The next question is from Jason Ader of William Blair. Please go ahead. Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around the identification of other user product lines that you might be exceeding and I know you want to give competitive information, which I totally respect. But I guess the question is have you identified other use in product lines at this point or you still in that process. And then secondly just for Robyn, can you give us the guidance for interest and other income now that you have in your debt flowing through the balance sheet? Robyn Denholm : Rami, you would answer the question Rami Rahim : Yeah, sure. I\u2019ll start. The question of did we actually take action already, the answer is yes, we have gone through the analysis we\u2019ve evaluated the projects that we are already undertaken and we have in fact reallocate resources of the project that all pre-revenue and that has already given us an ability to start to focus on some of the really important strategic initiatives around cloud, High Q network function virtualization FDN that\u2019s just very meaningful to our customers and I just kind of leave it that. Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Rami. So on the interest side yes, clearly the interest rate, borrowings that we made in the quarter will add to our interest expense in the quarter, next quarter. So, we expect that we had reasonably low interest quarter for this quarter is just under $10 million. We expected to be in the $14 million to $16 million range for the next quarter. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, great. Next question operator. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder S. Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities :  Thanks and most of my questions has been answered. I just wondered a broad one for Rami in the routing side, we\u2019ve seen historically just cycles in this business driven partly by product repurchase sometimes by macro. I am just thinking as we come to this repurchase, can you speak about how it\u2019s different and how this won\u2019t be a situation where by from now with difficult comps looking at significant deteriorated revenue line what\u2019s different of value, which is - what that top two or three things that come to mind that would help? Shaygan Kheradpir : Okay, yes sure Kulbinder, I\u2019d say again you have to take a look at the market opportunity and the service provider spend in light of cable and in light of web services. And also telcos of course and each of these have a very different set of drivers and the cable space for example there is a huge amount of demand on the network because of the video traffic. In the web services space its things like cloud data center interconnect and peering technology. And telcos the things like consolidation of different network functions into fewer networks that are capable of providing a multitude of different services. Network function virtualization and so forth. These are trends that have been in the market for some time and they will continue. Now there might be ebbs and flows if you will of spending in different parts of the market like in the core or on the edge and different architectural approaches that our customers take, might in fact put more pressure on certain parts of the market or network then in others. And again I will just go back to my statement that is just really important for us to make sure that we\u2019ve got the solutions and the product that can satisfy those architectural trends irrespective of the way that they in fact play out or timing of how they play out. If you look at all that, and you look again at the broader definition of the service provider that I talked about I think that the opportunity for us to have a good revenue, its healthy growth in the TAM and a great product portfolio help that took advantage of it. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay great, and operator we have time for one more question before we close today. Operator : Thank you and the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Paul J. Silverstein \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: It\u2019s always great to be last you can ask unlimited number of questions. Let me start off. Kathleen Nemeth : Hi Paul. Paul J. Silverstein \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi Kathleen appreciate you taken the question. A couple of questions if I may first of, can you all talk about pricing trends in switching, co-routing and edge routing. In switching how much of the growth is new customers, how much is from existing customers and with the respect to existing customers how much of that growth is from a refresher or upgrades to the new 9200 relatively new 9200 platform from the older EX platforms and how much is more organic. And that on to security piece can you set some insight, I know you told us that the old NetScreen OS point products are now 15% down from 20% but with respect to the SRX. How much of the revenue is from the enterprise SRX which you have been struggling on track and how much is from the higher end product that\u2019s been doing so well, as we try to understand going forward. One last question which is I know the legal expenses questions has been asked a lot, but my simple question is if then when legal expense comes back to normalized level is that over and above the OpEx reductions that you have projected in the IOP or is that part of the IOP projections? Shaygan Kheradpir : Okay so we\u2019ll go one at a time quickly. We start with the IOP question, we have a very rigorous disciplined execution path 4160 we are committed to 160 \u2013 and so that\u2019s we leave it at that, so that I think it\u2019s the moving parts, we are going to hit 160 in the glide path as Robyn went through and we put on our slide back. Robyn Denholm : What was the other question? Shaygan Kheradpir : Okay, on pricing Robyn, do you want to take a cover? Robyn Denholm : Yes, Paul as I mentioned in my prepared remarks it is a competitive environment overall. And what you could see now in gross margin \u2013 our product gross margin, we are actually doing quite well on that. Year-over-year we saw a slight degradation due to mix, but quarter-over-quarter actually was only one can stand, and as you can see we are moving into different categories and that type of thing and our gross margins are doing very well. And so that\u2019s because we are focused on innovation and differentiation with the product set. It\u2019s also because we are focused on reducing our costs over time as well, and as a company we\u2019ve had a huge focus on that over the past four to six quarters. Rami, do you want to add anything in terms of competitiveness. Rami Rahim : No, that\u2019s it. We focused on the parts of the market where the discussion with the customers certainly in both pricing, but it\u2019s not purely about pricing it\u2019s about a multitude of things and capabilities in addition to pricing and that\u2019s what we do I think quite well. Shaygan Kheradpir : And then I think that last one and maybe I\u2019ll ask Robyn and Rami as well is I mean I coupled a last sort of two questionnaires, this company the diversity revenue now across those segment it\u2019s just not that one segment, it is multiple segments and then when you overlay the dynamics of these segment with all the different types of workloads that they are trying to handle as they build their clouds in High IQ networks. It\u2019s a \u2013 one size doesn\u2019t fit all, right and we see that sort of in switching, security and routing like your questions on switching, mostly new customers, but its frankly when you look at the, that the type of workloads it is not sort of commodity closet switches. It\u2019s actually quite interesting sort of the used cases that we handle. Rami, do you want to sort of take the switching question and I think that was also part of your question. Rami Rahim : I don\u2019t have an exact figure in my head of what the ratio is, it\u2019s both. I mean we love selling to our customers chassis that are partly populated with lying card, whether they have been in switching, and routing or security because we are reserving self base that we can go and populate over a period of time, and there is a lot of that going on. But as we also mentioned in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A, we\u2019re winning global bank, we\u2019re winning web services companies that are all leveraging our switching, routing and security products and that just adds on to our business some it\u2019s the combination. Robyn Denholm : So on the security side I can answer that for you Paul in terms of our Junos Space firewall security product, you were right it was less than 20% a year ago and now it\u2019s less than 15% that\u2019s related to the non-Junos Space products. In terms of the SRX products they grew 13% year-over-year and in terms of the contribution to that growth the majority in this quarter was service provider, but we also had year-over-year growth in terms of enterprise as well. And as Rami mentioned before some of the focus that we\u2019ve had on the high end SRX over this last four quarters to actually improve the performance of that is equally applicable in terms of the branch SRX and those types of products and that\u2019s what the team has focused on as we move forward here. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, great. So that is all the time that we have this afternoon. We appreciate your participation and all of your great questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you so much everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

Please note that today\u2019s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Juniper had another solid quarter, delivering on the upper end of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 7% and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 38%. Our revenue was well diversified across our target verticals including carriers, Web 2.0, cable and financial services and across all geographies. We're seeing good trends in U.S. federal aided by more stable market environment and government budgets normalizing after a protected period of constraint. We delivered good performance across our routing and switching product lines, both of which grew year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with our routing performance which grew 7% year-over-year and if normalized for last year's deferred revenue recognition of $34 million, grew 14% year-over-year. Our highlights include switching growth of 25% and continued customer transaction of Contrail SDN. While overall security was down Junos Space SRX products delivered good year-over-year growth of 9%. All-in-all, a very good performance for the June quarter. Since the last earnings call, I have been on a whirlwind tour meeting with over 70 customers and partners. They are all enthusiastic about our strategy to be the leading provider of High-IQ networks and best in class cloud builder. What\u2019s really resonating is our approach of listening and understanding in a deep way to the particular business imperative and linking them to Juniper\u2019s out of the possible innovation. Parts of our renewed focus aligns our efforts across our go-to-market and R&D organizations by taking a deliberate used case driven approach to helping our customers deliver innovation that matters to their customers and operations. While our strategy is clearly resonating with our customers, there are some specific, customer specific dynamics in the near-term that we are factoring into our outlook. Specifically, within U.S. based service providers, their market dynamics including M&A activity are impacting, both sequencing and timing of projects. While this will impact our near-term outlook, we are well positioned with these customers with major design wins in key areas of their network including next generation projects. Despite the current near-term uncertainty, there are number of positives. First, we expect continued strong growth in our Web 2.0, cable and federal customers; second, EMEA is showing positive momentum with customers continuing to build out their network capacity; third, we are seeing good performance out of our enterprise sector. I am very confident that our market position is strengthening and our momentum in winning new business and new customer logos over the medium and the long-term is strong. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the four pillars of our Integrated Operating Plan. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to our commitments and I'm pleased with our progress.  First, we pivoted our strategy towards growth areas of the market centered on cloud building and High-IQ networking. And we deliberately aligned our resources and partner ecosystem to customers in defined verticals that are in a build cycle for these growth areas. We are seeing clear signs of success as well as an increasingly diverse customer set. For example, three of our top five customers this quarter are either Web 2.0 or cable companies. Second, we successfully implemented to organizational structure required to drive our strategy. By streamlining the company with a One-Juniper mindset, one go-to-market organization, one R&D organization and one aligned infrastructure organization. We have focused our go-to-market and R&D resources on projects with highest potential for growth and we continue to drive leverage engineering across our routing, switching and security products, via Junos, Silicon end systems. As part of this realignment, today we announced that sale of our Junos Pulse business which is our SSL VPN solution for securing remote network access. We are making the pivot fully toward stated high growth strategy of Cloud-Builder and High-IQ networks for which security is essential and we are shifting our resources into security areas to commensurate with this strategy. In terms of how we work. We are implementing initiatives to drive greater collaboration and co-creation across organizational boundaries as well as setting new standards of accountability. These changes will allow us to grow faster, work more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers business imperatives. Third, we continue to drive structural efficiencies across the organization and have executed on specific cost management actions focused on four key areas, consolidation and reduplication, de-layering the organization, greater automation of business processes and focusing on innovation that matters most to our customers. Our OpEx this quarter was $515 million, which is $24 million lower than Q4, 2013. Our baseline for the IOP. This represents an annualized savings of approximately $100 million, nearly two-third towards our goal of $160 million in annual savings. The $24 million of in-quarter savings are primarily headcount related costs and structural in nature. Approximately three-quarters of our headcount savings comes from de-layering and reduplicating management positions. We also reduced approximately 10% of our facility footprint by implementing a new dynamic workplace model. In addition, we have made decisions that will give us line of sight to do remaining cost savings goal by Q1, 2015. Our cost control committee under my leadership continues to drive implementation of efficiencies throughout the organization. All actions to-date are strengthening Juniper's muscle and smart efficiencies with mechanisms in place to ensure cost will not come back even after we reach our targeted savings goal. Finally, we've greatly improved our allocation and management of capital. We continue to deliver very strong cash flows from our operations. This has been a consistent area of our strength for Juniper enabling us to invest in growing the business as well as generating returns for our shareholders. The actions we\u2019re taking include the initiation of the quarterly cash dividend this quarter and then aggressive return of $3 billion to our shareholders as per our plan. In addition, we\u2019ve successfully concluded our patent litigation and recorded a gain of $195 million. We are committed to delivering our integrated operating plans and driving significant value for our shareholders. Now let me talk about the industry outlook. As the customization of demand for rapid innovation as mass scale, our customers willing to continue to invest in the network. We are seeing our key verticals at the forefront of this wave of change making the transition to high-IQ networking and Cloud-Building and they\u2019re all driving towards a common set of network architectures that are converging across verticals. Market fundamentals for Juniper\u2019s routing products continues to be healthy and increasingly diversified. Routing demand is being driven by consolidation of networks across business and residential services, wireline and wireless and the need for Cloud-Building. Bandwidth demand continues to increase and favors our products speed and density advantage such as the industry\u2019s first 0.5 Terabyte per second line card in our MX platform that we\u2019ve just begun shipping. Demand for switching products also remain strong driven by four trends. First next generation data center transformation projects, and the need for carrier grade availability and operational simplicity. Second, hyperscale cloud build outs. Third proliferation of big data and video requiring very high performance networking and 10 Gigabit Ethernet refresh. And fourth, increasing need for open architectures and end-to-end automation. These trends favor our products. For example, our customers have been using our QFX5100 line as a fundamental building blocks for carrier class layer 2 and 3 switching as well as the foundation for automation capabilities such as seamless workloads movements. In addition, many of our customers are going into production with Contrail as they look to automate and orchestrate the creation of highly scalable virtual networks. In Q2, we have had two large public clouds go live with Contrail, one in APAC and the other CloudWatt, the largest cloud in France. We've helped launch private cloud as well including one with a global leader in enterprise security. In security, the decline of our legacy NetScreen product has accelerated and while we disappointed with overall growth rate, we are pleased that our Junos Space SRX portfolio was up 11% in the first half of the year, the growth was driven by demands for high performance Firewalls, virtualized Firewalls, high IQ features for stress detection and mitigation and end to end management simplicity. As I've noted before, SRX based security offerings are a differentiated and critical element of our strategy of Cloud-Building and delivering high IQ networks. Let me walk you through why. One, our Cloud-Building customers are increasingly aware that integrating carrier class security is an imperative and therefore are choosing our security ramping and switching products as an on-sample for the cloud and virtualized data centers. Two, as our customers make the transition to LTE and NFV, security has become a crucial component of their overall solution. And example is security based services that work seamlessly with our MX and Contrail products. And finally there is a significant level of technology sharing between our Junos-based SRX security routing and switching across silicon systems and software that enables a very high leverage R&D strategy. We are executing on this strategy focusing our security investments on projects with the highest ROI, while improving the overall profitability of our company. As the only high performance, pure play IP networking company, we are uniquely positioned to build the bridge of the future for our customers. We are playing a critical role in helping them be more relevant as they look to create new business models, increase productivity and optimize for rapid deployment of new services. I see great opportunity across our customer base and I am confident that Juniper can help our customers change the world in creative new ways. In summary while there are some specific customer dynamics that we are carefully navigating in the near-term I am confident in our opportunities and growth prospects in the medium and long-term. I would like to thank our employees for the commitments and relentless focus on our customers and execution. Now I will turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results. Robyn Denholm :  Thank you Shaygan and good afternoon everyone I am pleased to report that our Q2 \u201814 results reflect healthy revenue growth and continued strong earnings expansion. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year with growth in all three geographies, driven by good performance in our routing, switching and SRX security products. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 38% year-over-year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit earnings growth. Before I go into detail on the quarter's results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. One of the important elements of our cost reduction activities is that we have been very mindful of how we allocate and shift resources to ensure that we continue to invest in areas that will drive the future growth of the company. In the quarter, we consolidated our Sunnyvale campus, discontinued several R&D projects which had a lower return on investment and lastly, completed our headcount restructuring. As a result of these actions in the quarter, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $72 million, approximately $10 million with the headcount actions taken during the first half of the year, the remaining $62 million was related to asset write-downs including $44 million for facility consolidation, $14 million for inventory and $4 million for R&D project cancellations and asset impairments. This brings total restructuring charges to-date to $194 million versus our original total estimate of $220 million. We are pleased with the pace with which we are taking out structural cost out of the business and anticipate our future restructuring charges to be in the order of $5 million to $10 million. I'm also pleased with the execution of our capital return plan. As I mentioned during our call last quarter, we initiated a $1.2 billion ASR of which $900 million of shares were delivered in Q1. We expect the remaining shares to be delivered no later than the end of August. Given our strong cash generation, we intend to opportunistically repurchase a minimum of $550 million in addition to the ASR by the end of the year. This means that before year-end we'll complete at least $1.75 billion against our commitment to repurchase $2 billion by the end of Q1 2015. I am also pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. This puts in place another piece of our commitment to returning $3 billion to our shareholders over the next three years. As we have said before, we expect to grow this dividend over time. These capital initiatives reflect our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of Juniper's business as well as our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We have carefully structured the program to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. And as you would expect, we will provide update on our progress against these initiatives each quarter. Now, I would like to move into a discussion of the Q2 results. Looking at our demand metrics, our book-to-bill was approximately 1. Total product deferred revenue was up sequentially $20 million and down $26 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to an increase in channel related inventory. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,230 million, up 7% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Product revenue was up 8% year-over-year and 6% over last quarter. As you may recall, in Q2 of 2013, we recognized $34 million of previously deferred routing revenue from a U.S. government customer. If you exclude the revenue recognition from last year\u2019s results, total revenue growth this quarter would have been 10% and product revenue growth would have been 12%. This revenue recognition also impacted the year-over-year growth grades through enterprise and routing. Services revenue was $300 million, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.46, an increase of $0.27 year-over-year. This included a net gain of $195 million related to a patent litigation settlement, which resulted in a $0.41 positive impact to earnings. This was offset by restructuring and other charges of $72 million which resulted in a $0.15 negative impact. In the quarter we also incurred a charge of $0.03 associated with an industry wide memory product quality related item. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40, up $0.11 year-over-year and over last quarter. This represents a 38% increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to a substantial improvement in operating margin fueled by higher revenue, improved gross margins and the decrease in operating expenses. We had a positive impact from reduced share count of approximately $0.02 year-over-year. Before I go into detail on revenue, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the trends that we saw this quarter. We continue to see healthy drivers of long-term demand and design wins with customers across the world. In the U.S., we saw continued momentum in demand with Web 2.0, cable and enterprise customers. This diversity of demand is a key strength for us going forward. However life in the quarter, we saw some delays in the timing of project with the few key U.S. service providers. Based on current visibility, we expect these delays to impact second half results. Outside of the Americas, we saw continued strength in EMEA carrier spending coupled with several good build in select markets in APAC. Now let's look at the results in detail. All written experience sequential revenue growth Americas revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by Web 2.0 customers, a reflection of the continued diversity of our revenue. Americas enterprise decreased 9% year-over-year. However taking into account the previously mentioned government deferred revenue recognition from last year the growth rate would have been 6%. Sequentially Americas enterprise increased 6% led by strength in the U.S. federal market. EMEA revenue was up 8% over last year and 10% sequentially due to healthy growth in the service provider market with particular strength among large carriers in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. APAC was flat sequentially, an increase $0.11 year-over-year primarily driven by strength with regional carriers across the theatre as well as growth in the enterprise market. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $832 million, up 15% year-over-year across all three geographies and up 6% sequentially driven by EMEA and the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $398 million down 6% year-over-year excluding the government deferred revenue recognition from last year so year-over-year growth rate was 2%. Sequentially enterprise revenue was up 3% led by healthy U.S. federal and financial services demand partially offset by routing products revenue with $618 million up 12% sequentially and 7% year-over-year; the sequential growth was driven by a strong performance for MX and significant improvement for (inaudible). Switching products revenue was a record $200 million up 25% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The sequential growth rate was driven primarily by QFabric products. The year-over-year growth was driven by a combination of both QFX and EX products. Total security product revenue was $112 million down 17% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. We are disappointed with this performance however it does reflect the trend that we have been seeing as steady increase in Junos-based security products and a significant drop in the non-Junos-based security products. Our SRX platform and security software were up 9% year-over-year and up 11% for the first half of the year. We have included a table in our slide deck breaking out the security product revenue. Moving on to the gross margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 63.5% last quarter and 63.7% a year ago. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in both product and services gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.4%, up six-tenth of a point from last quarter and up 1.6 points from a year-ago. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased volume. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 60.5%, down 2.8 points from a year ago and up eight-tenth of a point sequentially. The year-over-year decline is higher support cost. The sequential increase is due to higher revenue and flat support related cost. We expect services margins to continue to modestly improve in the second half of the year. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million at the lower end of the range that we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus in execution against our integrated operating plan. This represents the $27 million or 5% sequential reduction. This includes a $6 million reduction in patent litigation related expenses versus the first quarter, due to the settlement. The remaining legal and litigation fees in Q2 were $12 million, consistent with Q1. We are on track to deliver against the $160 million of annualized cost reduction goal that we announced in February. Our headcount ended the quarter at 9,083 which represents 5% decline sequentially and year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.3% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 3.4 points and a sequential increase of 5.1 points due to higher revenue, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses. The non-GAAP tax rate was 26% compared to 25.6% last quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 24.9% compared to 25.3% in Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of net cash and investments, an increase of approximately $480 million sequentially. This includes a $165 million related to the patent litigation settlement. Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 37% of total growth cash balance. Q2 operating cash flows were unusually strong at $425 million. This included $75 million of cash received from the patent litigation settlement. The strong cash flows during the quarter were also attributable to higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments and improved working capital metrics. Inline with recent trends, DSO improved to 41 days. CapEx was $41 million in the quarter and depreciation and amortization expense was $45 million. Now I will review our outlook for Q3. As a reminder these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share account. As previously mentioned, there were some customer specific dynamics in the near term that we have factored in, into our outlook. While we are well positioned with these customers, with our current visibility to we expect sequencing and timing related delays to effect both Q3 and Q4. This is partially offset by science and strength in emerging verticals such as Web 2.0 and cable as well as a positive outlook for enterprise. We see positive momentum in EMEA with customers continuing to build out their network capacity. For the third quarter we expect revenues to range from $1,150 million to $1,200 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $505 million, plus or minus $5 million, which at the midpoint is a $10 million reduction from Q2, and a $5 million reduction from our previously published targets. We\u2019re delivering on our cost reduction commitments. Operating margins are expected to be 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.35 and $0.40 per share, assuming a share count of approximately $475 million. This continues our strong expansion of earnings with growth of 14% at the midpoint of the guided range. We expect a flat tax rate versus the second quarter. As you know, we announced the sell of our Junos Pulse business today. The impact has been factored into this guidance and it\u2019s immaterial to our revenue outlook for Q3. The revenue impact beyond Q3 can be guided from the supplemental table provided. We expect this sale to close late in Q3. We have factored the cost-savings associated with this sale as part of our goal of achieving a $160 million in cost savings as we exit the first quarter of 2015. To conclude, I am really pleased with the performance of the entire Juniper team. The first half of 2014 has been a time of solid execution for the company, we have lots of moving parts and we have continued our focus on the things that matter most to our customers and shareholders. I am very proud of our team and thanks them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, first just housekeeping item and then my question. Can you provide us the numbers for Pulse and also the all platform also for Q3 and Q4 of last year, then we'll have a complete picture of how security was trending? Second question and then that goes back to my main question. When I look at your, and this is more kind of a statement than the question I would like to here maybe Shaygan might, I'd like to here your view. When I look at your plan, the expense side of the equation is almost done, you almost finished with the expense reduction. And then I look at the numbers in switching is relatively flat for three quarters now, the growth is mainly because you have easy comps from last year. In security, we are back to the levels, we are down back to the levels of March 13 you quoted the six months numbers, but if you actually look at Q2 numbers were down sequentially back to the levels of first quarter '13 and in routing there are delays. So how long do you think if put the expenses aside, how long do you think is going to take us to see the changes you are implementing on the product portfolio and growth acceleration and impact on switching and routing and security et cetera? Thanks. Shaygan Kheradpir :  Hi Tal, this is Shaygan, good afternoon. On your first question on drilling into Pulse, I am going to ask Robyn to sort of go through the numbers and then we\u2019ll take the second one. Robyn Denholm :  Yeah so in the slide deck, that\u2019s on our website we have provided the data for the last six quarters, so you can see the Junos Pulse revenues for the quarter Q2 of \u201814 we did product revenue of 15.9 million which is included in our security product revenue and we also did about $15.5 million worth of services. And as I mentioned the transaction on the Pulse file I will conclude right in third quarter is what we are expecting and so we don\u2019t expect any impact to the revenue in Q3, but you can use the table to model the impact to Q4. Just going back to the other housekeeping question the ScreenOS product revenue for Q2 \u201814 was about $13.2 million which is less than 12% of our total product revenue that compares to previous quarter where it was under 14% at about 18.3%. So it\u2019s dropping off quite significantly from the ScreenOS perspective. Shaygan Kheradpir :  Thanks Robyn and Tal on your second question, I would say that we continue to take share on both switching and routing. And as you mentioned before on security this year the stabilization phase, if you look at our numbers this quarter if you normalize for the one time from last year at this time on routing, routing was up 14%, switching was up 24%. We are taking share and we continue to do significant enhancements at both product lines. For the balance of the year, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have a couple of U.S. service providers with whom we are very close at all levels and in continuous dialog. Because of their market environment and what they need to do, they are risk sequencing and that's going to impact some of the timing of our programs as we were working with them. We are -- the growth drivers, our product positioning, we are very encouraged by both and overall for our 2015, we have an overall constructive view of where we are heading. So overall, we feel good about our product positioning and our market positioning. And I think this quarter's growth and growth year-to-date for both routing, switching and I would also say even though in security we are tuning in now heavily to our SRX space, Junos space products, it has respectable growth of 9% year-over-year. So, we feel good. Thank you very much. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan : Yes, hi. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod, thanks for taking my question. I want to understand a little bit about the customer specific dynamics you talk about. You said it's going to be weak in Q3 and Q4. So are we sort of expecting a better seasonal Q1 and Q2 next year? Also if you could comment on which verticals you see impacting, that would be helpful. Shaygan Kheradpir :  Yes, your first question was about -- Ash was about the dynamics, the market dynamics of the couple of the service providers. I don\u2019t want to really go into that but I think you can see they\u2019re very transparent in terms of where they are putting their capital, for what reason and there is some M&A that is in the market, we know that and I encourage you to think about M&A in the broader sense. And when you put it all together and I have lived in those markets in the U.S. specifically for a quarter century, it makes everything comes together and some of our internal metrics also late in the quarter sort of flash. So we want to be prudent and we want to be cautious for the balance of the year. But we're also because of the growth drivers that we talked about and where we are from a product perspective, we are overall constructive for 2015. Robyn, do you want to add anything there? Robyn Denholm : I think you've discussed it quite well, Shaygan. Shaygan Kheradpir :  Thanks Ash. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thank you. Can you clarify if Pulse was contributing positively to EPS for new account for the associated expenses? And then just remind us how much of your revenues go in to campus or access environments as opposed to the focus areas, Shaygan that you\u2019ve talked about of datacenter and cloud. Shaygan Kheradpir :  Hi Simona, this is Shaygan. I will pass the question to Robyn. I will just say about Pulse, two second. Pulse is a good asset. The issue is it's not in line with our strategy which is very much focused on cloud build or High-IQ and how those markets are shaping. And we want to really focus our security line around growth where the markets are going and very strong in. So with that I am going to pass to Robyn to take the question on Pulse. Robyn Denholm : Yes. As Shaygan mentioned, intent of doing strategic review with our portfolio, Pulse was an asset, a good asset but as Shaygan mentioned, not directly in the line with strategic focus of the company. And therefore we have announced the sale of the asset today. It has been mildly accretive for us over the years in terms of the overall P&L but given the focus of the company and the intent to return on investment, we\u2019ve decided that that\u2019s an asset that with better in the hands of the another entity to look after it. Shaygan Kheradpir : And Simona, on your second question I am going to ask Rami to comment and say few words. Rami Rahim : Yes. On the question on campus versus -- sorry Simona, on the question about the campus versus data center aspects of our switching business. The majority of our switching business goes into data center and combination data center campus switching scenarios. There are in fact large enterprise customers where the line between their mission critical campus and the data center is essentially blurring. They view the campus as an onramp to the data center. We\u2019re not going after the smaller wiring clauses types of campuses; we\u2019re really going after the larger strategic high performance High-IQ type of campus networks that many of our customers are building. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks Simona. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: Hey guys, hey Robyn, hey Shaygan. How are you? Shaygan Kheradpir : Hi Ehud. Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: Hi. A couple of quick questions. First of all, back to the SRX, it was strong in Q3, Q4, was very strong in Q1 and then fell fairly hard to about $80 million in Q2. I want to get a sense if that\u2019s seasonal or because Q2 last year also had a similar impact or was there large build that one on for those three quarters Q3, 4 and 1 or any other color that we can get on the dynamics over there. Then, I wanted to pick up a little bit on Contrail. You talked about continued traction in Contrail. Can you give us a sense as to is that -- is Contrail actually selling the standalone product yet, is there some revenue we can be looking at that or is there pull through that we can be looking on possibly the QFX or other products? And now that Cisco is out with their ACI and their APIC, how are you seeing that change of dynamic in the conversations on Contrail? And then lastly, Web 2.0 and cable guys, Robyn you talk about these guys a lot now. Can you give us a sense how large to Web 2.0 guys are? Are they 5% of your revenue now? Give us a sense as to what we should be looking from that vertical? Thank you. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks Ehud. There is I think four or five questions there, so I'll punch them some quickly and I\u2019ll have Robyn and Rami also chime in if they want. So on SRX, as we have pivoted to Junos Space SRX security line, obviously this is a cloud builder High-IQ service provider carrier grave kind of firewalls. And the sales of that obviously is more lumpy than I would say your grandfather\u2019s firewall in normal branches and stuff. So you will obviously see lumpiness in those sales just because of the nature of what we are selling which is very, very high end. On Contrail we are very happy and encouraged with the progress is that we are very early in the game obviously and it\u2019s all about design wins holistically for clouds be it private clouds or public clouds infrastructure as a service and so forth and so on. So they started this just last year, late last year they have a large number of talks proof of concepts, they have pivoted now from talks making those go into production and the funnel keeps growing on talks. And they are being very deliberate on these wins because they are big they are sophisticated and we have to get them right and we are doing that. The other two questions were Robyn and Rami. Robyn Denholm :  So I can answer the question. One thing I wanted to underscore on the SRX Ehud, so you are right it is lumpy and Q1 we did have a deployment in the service provider area and so that is one of the reasons why we saw the sequential decline in SRX based products. In terms of Web 2.0 and cable they did drive the growth in the Americas both sequentially and to some extent year-over-year and as Shaygan mentioned three out of our top five customers as a company are in that Web 2.0 cable sector in the quarter. So they are obviously an important part from a future perspective around the diversification of our revenue. Having said that, obviously our carriers are also very important to us and as we highlighted in the outlook given their size and relevance to our revenue any reduction in their revenue in the near term does have a direct impact on us. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thank you Robyn. And Ehud on your last question, I would say, suffices to say we are intense of course with our customers all the time and clearly the customers that we work with Cloud Builder, High-IQ types, they are very much want open no lock in and future proof solutions under cloud solutions. So, that's all I say Rami do you want to say anything else on that from that front? Rami Rahim : I'll just add on the SRX front, there is a service provider component to the business that tends to be somewhat lumpy, the biggest use case being for example LTE security. And then on the Contrail side, I think Shaygan already mentioned it. The one thing that I will add is that we are seeing that in the first few deployments they are being deployed, Contrail being deployed in heterogeneous networks where there is a combination of Juniper and other peer type of infrastructure and it just speaks to the openness of the solution which our customers very much appreciate. Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: [And no lock in]. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks Ehud. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Ehud. Next question please operator? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to understand to what degree the delays are likely to be the most impact of routing business in the second half or if you are expecting to see impact in switching and security given many of your carriers who have buying portfolio products. And then I was also hoping you could help us understand if you expect revenue for the second half of the year to be up relative to the first half of the year and is there any reason we shouldn't expect the overall you to grow in 2014? Shaygan Kheradpir :  Hi, Jess. So on your first question since they are -- the softness is coming from a couple of U.S. service providers and you are right they buy upon sample, but they are very -- we are very heavily embedded with them with our routing products of MX and TTX series. So the impact is going to be more on our routing rather than switching and security. And the second question I forgot but I think you will have a Robyn? Robyn Denholm : Yes. So overall as we said in terms of the outlook we are expecting a down quarter for the third quarter and we are expecting these delays to impact our fourth quarter as well. We do expect on the switching side Shaygan mentioned the routing side, we do expect in switching that in the second half of the year that we will grow that business as well the products in switching area. Just bear in mind the compares that we have as is that look at the second half for us to switching. And on security we expect the same trend that we've seen over the first half that the ScreenOS product will continue to decline and the Junos based SRX platforms will increase over the second half. Kathleen Nemeth :  Jess this is Kathleen just to answer your question specifically we do expect overall 2014 revenue to be up this year. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo : Thanks guys. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Trevor (inaudible) in for Ben. My questions on security specifically and around the strategy so what gives you the confidence in the strategy in general and the ability to return to growth across the portfolio? While SRX seems to be core to the strategy it\u2019s on a negative trajectory at the same time as 1Q \u201813 and while the other two businesses are growing pretty nicely despite this. So, at what point does it make sense to consider alternatives given that returns to growth seemingly would require significant investment? Shaygan Kheradpir : Hi Trevor this is Shaygan. We are very committed to security. Point number one, I went through in my prepared remarks of the logic behind that behind our SRX based security which we think is very differentiated and it\u2019s a very critical element of cloud builder and high IQ networks. I don\u2019t want to repeat what I said in my script but you can go it, I think we\u2019ve laid it out very nicely, quickly know what is going to buy cloud with the big giant hole on the side. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for there. It\u2019s critical for our service provider customers which are even with our increasing diversity of our revenues as you can see, they\u2019re still very material customers. And in their transition to LTE and NFV it is an absolute critical component for their transitions and it works seamlessly with MX and Contrail as hand in glove. And finally if you come into our labs and see the amount of commonality in terms of componentry Silicon, Chassis, of course Junos software they are all, I would, I think leverage engineering is now doesn't quite do justice too, it's a lot of commonality. And now that all three switching, routing and security are under our JDI organization that's led by Rami, we expect growth to pick-up over to medium and long-term on our security, the logic is very sound and impeccable and pick-up profitably because of the natural synergies that exists between these product lines.  So yeah, we are very committed to SRX based security products and actually very encouraged to the medium to long-term prospects for the rationale that I went through. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Marketing. Please proceed with your question. Mark Sue - RBC Marketing : Shaygan, will you recognize the company will keep the assets routing, switching and security/SRX. Are there other non-essential assets that you can further divest or we [missed you] done with that. And as we look at improving the strength of the SRX and perhaps the other product portfolio segments. Should we think about, how should we think about R&D spending, how should we think about spending potentially going backup or in the process of reducing OpEx but I will be at a point where you need to defend your market share and also improve the products so that the OpEx needs to kind of increase again. How should we think about from a planning point of view what the steady rate OpEx should be on an annual basis? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes. Mark again very quickly. As you have managed the business very closely and very prudently, and very focused we continue as a matter of course continue to always look at our portfolio to make sure that they are aligned with our strategy point number one, which is the one you have stated which is IOP which is cloud that there are High-IQ which is around growth and profitable growth that matters to our customers we continue to do that. As a matter of course we talked about Pulse this was one of them that didn\u2019t fit our (inaudible) charts and we took action. So that\u2019s just been normal course of our business and now that we have a very clear strategy that we have tested over and over again, internally, externally I just came back with 70 partners and customers, it\u2019s just a very vivid that this is where the world is going and what we are doing is exactly right. So we have the right filter to balance that upon. The second question is it\u2019s about we are also very committed to our IOP targets and I reemphasized that so you should rest assured there. And I think our track record so far should give you some comfort that we know how to land the IOP targets. And the last question was\u2026 Robyn Denholm :  Yes sure, just on the planning purposes on the OpEx side in the slide deck we included our charts, obviously we are committed to the 160 in terms of cost reductions exiting Q1 of 2015 as Shaygan mentioned. We have also said that will be less than $500 million for Q1 of 2015 we have just achieved the low end of their range for Q2 in terms of 515 and we have given you guidance for 505 plus or minus 5 for both Q3 and Q4. So, as Shaygan mentioned, we are very committed to the OpEx target and we are doing it in a way that makes it clear that we continue to invest in our long-term future around product development. And yes\u2026. Shaygan Kheradpir : And thank you Robyn. And Mark, the last point is IOP is all about focusing on where the market is going and profitable growth. So all the actions we are taking is actually putting our best engineers, our best go-to-market people very focused around areas of growth and strengthening those. So, as we\u2019ve said before this is not a slash and burn kind of a project. It's very surgical, very focused, we are -- the thing we just did with Pulse and some of the best engineers and so forth and so on. We all focusing them on the growth of security and SRX based products as opposed to in a wide spectrum of things which we may have net prospects for growth. So, we feel very good about our strategy and feel very good about our focus on the product line, our level of talent where the products are going, very excited about the pipeline and very extremely happy with the level of customer engagements, the way I described in my prepared remarks in terms of going deep with them on the strategic customers and strategic partners. This is what IOP is all about. And the good news is when you focus, you also eliminate unnecessary cost. This is what we're doing and we're committed to all of the above. Thank you. Mark Sue - RBC Marketing : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi. Please proceed with your question. Amitabh Passi - UBS:  Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Shaygan, Robyn I was wondering is there a way to quantify what do you think the impact is from the delays with the U.S. based service providers? If I look at the midpoint of your guidance, you are about 85 million short of where consensus was. And I am just trying to get a sense is the majority of that explained by these delays? And then just a quick follow up on Junos Pulse, Robyn why wouldn't we see incremental OpEx savings in the fourth quarter once the divestiture has occurred? Shaygan Kheradpir :  Hi Amitabh, this is Shaygan. I think the answer to your first question, quick answer is yes it is those couple of U.S. based service providers for very specific market reasons in their markets and dynamics that have impacted their second half. I will now hand it to Robyn to take the rest. Robyn Denholm : Yes, in terms of the OpEx related to Pulse that is included in $160 million of OpEx savings. We had identified this as an area for which we believe that we could save some OpEx and focus the company in terms of the overall strategy that we were focused on. Kathleen Nemeth :  Okay. All right, thanks Amitabh. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. That is all the time that we have. We appreciate your excellent questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Inc., Research Division Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Vince Molinaro, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation, will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, overall future prospects, planned operating, expensed reductions and capital allocation plans are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including: economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in the overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and other major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper's Integrated Operating Plan and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In today's call, we will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, other than revenue and share count, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance to GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded for non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, we completed the sale of our Junos Pulse security product line earlier this month. Please ensure your financial models are appropriately adjusted. Further information and our long-term model will be shared during our Investor Day later this month in New York City. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I wanted to give you an update on progress at Juniper, including the impact of industry trends on our revenues, our work on our Integrated Operating Plan and steps we are taking to ensure we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value going forward. While we have made significant progress executing beyond our IOP commitments associated with capital return and operating expenses, we are disappointed with our revenue performance this quarter. Our Q3 revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The primary driver was lower-than-expected demand and slower ramp-up of new projects from service providers, particularly in the U.S. That said, our traction with Web 2.0 leaders has allowed us to partially offset the decline in carrier spending and increase the diversity of our revenue base. Notwithstanding these industry headwinds, we delivered non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range. We did so by maintaining strong gross margins, diligently managing expenses and executing aggressively against our IOP capital return goals. We have met or exceeded our commitments set forth in our Integrated Operating Plan in February while not losing sight of strategic engagements with key customers. We achieved our original cost reduction target this quarter by getting to a $500 million quarterly OpEx level from $539 million in fourth quarter of 2013. This came 2 quarters ahead of the original commitment. We're now further reducing our operating expense levels to $1,900,000,000 for the fiscal year 2015, a meaningful reduction from current levels. We believe that by continuing to take this kind of surgical approach to our cost reduction efforts, we can still invest sufficiently to grow our business and lead the next wave of IP networking innovation. Our One-Juniper organizational structure is allowing us to get products to market faster and cheaper as our common operating system and coalesced engineering and go-to-market teams continue to operate faster and more efficiently. In fact, we are excited about our product pipeline ahead and pleased with progress in our pivot to strategic vertical markets focused on cloud building and high-IQ networking. We have also exceeded our capital return commitment set forth at the Integrated Operating Plan. Our commitment through Q1 2015 was to return $2 billion of capital. We will return greater than that by Q4 2014. Our commitment through 2016 was to return $3 billion in capital. We have increased the size of our capital return program by $1.1 billion and now plan to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Given market conditions, we will take an aggressive stance and will plan to repurchase $1.5 billion by the end of Q2 2015. We also announced today a $0.10 per share cash dividend to be paid in Q4 with the intent to grow it in line with earnings over time. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the macro environment and our business. As I've stated previously, I believe the global networking market is at an inflection point, presenting substantial opportunities for growth. The underlying long-term demand trends support the need for increased investment in the network. Based upon historical trends and discussions with customers, we feel investment will return in the second half of next year, and that our integrated portfolio of routing, switching and security products will be well positioned to address critical customer requirements. Despite weaker macro conditions, the market fundamentals for Juniper's routing products continue to be healthy, and our customer base continues to be increasingly diversified. In Security, we saw good demand for high-end SRX products from service providers. Switching revenue declined quarter-over-quarter as we experienced an ebb in the wave of customer build-outs that we saw earlier in the year. Though we continue to see momentum for our switching products, we expect modest improvements until the recent wave of customer design wins ramps in 2015. We continue to see our integrated solutions as a fundamental building block and a differentiating factor for customers of cloud building and high-IQ networking, including the focus on secure routing and switching solutions for active defense. So what should you expect moving forward? We are focused on continuing to drive long-term shareholder value through profitable growth. We assume the carrier spending will remain constrained for several quarters, and we are streamlining our business with the before-mentioned operating expense reductions. We expect this to result in healthy year-over-year operating margin expansion in 2015. I am enthusiastic about our technology roadmap to deliver the next wave of IP networking, and I'm confident in our strong market position. We remain intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and relentless dedication to execution. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results. Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective primarily because the Service Provider demand, particularly in the U.S., is slowing more than expected. Despite this, we delivered non-GAAP earnings within our original guidance range due to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives. Before I go into detail on the results of the quarter, I'd like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. We continue to make good progress against our targets. We have achieved our IOP quarterly operating expense target 2 quarters earlier than expected. We also completed the consolidation of our Sunnyvale campus and negotiated an early exit of our lease, which has resulted in a credit of $26 million against our prior restructuring estimate. As announced on October 2, we finalized the sale of the Junos Pulse business. As a result, we anticipate booking a GAAP gain on the sale in Q4 of 2014. As expected, our Q3 results reflect a full quarter of this business. We are executing well on our capital return plan. We paid our inaugural dividend of $0.10 per share in September. We also completed our $1.2 billion ASR in July and repurchased an additional $550 million of shares in Q3. Since inception of our Integrated Operating Plan, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by 10% and 13% over the last 2 years. I'm very pleased at the pace of our cost reductions and our progress towards a more efficient capital structure. In the outlook section, I will provide detail on the additional costs and capital allocation action mentioned by Shaygan. Now let's turn to an analysis of the Q3 results. Demand was relatively weak in the quarter. Our product book-to-bill was approximately 1, and bookings were almost $100 million less than we expected. Total product deferred revenue declined $57 million year-over-year and $29 million versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was mainly the result of the sell-through of channel-related inventory and the reclassification of the Junos Pulse deferred revenue to a held-for-sale asset category. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,126,000,000, down 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Product revenue was $810 million, down 10% year-over-year and 13% over last quarter. Services revenue was $316 million, up 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of $0.04 year-over-year, including a $0.03 benefit from restructuring credit. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36, up $0.03 year-over-year and down $0.04 versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was due to lower revenue, partially offset by improvements in gross margin and operating expenses. Looking at our revenue for Q3. There were 4 primary factors which negatively impacted our results versus our expectations. U.S. carrier spending was worse than we had expected, and Web 2.0 Switching revenue was lower than anticipated due to the timing of deployments and the slower ramp of new projects. To a lesser extent, we saw a softening in the broad-based enterprise market and a greater-than-expected slowdown in demand from Eastern European service providers. Now let's look at the revenue results in detail. Americas revenue was up 3% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Americas Service Provider was up 1% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Web 2.0 and cable provider growth, partially offset by decline from carrier demand. The sequential decline was driven by weak demand by large carriers and a significant reduction in Web 2.0 Switching revenue in the quarter, partially offset by continued strength in cable providers and Web 2.0 routing. Americas Enterprise was up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Sequentially, we saw continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services, which was offset by some softness in the broad enterprise market. EMEA revenue was down 5% over last year and 11% versus last quarter. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in Western Europe and the Middle East, primarily in Service Providers, whilst the sequential decrease was driven by weakness in Eastern Europe. APAC was down 28% year-over-year and 19% versus last quarter, primarily due to Service Provider weakness in China and Japan. Service Provider revenue for the quarter was $742 million, down 6% year-over-year due to EMEA and APAC and U.S. carriers, partially offset by a slight increase in the Americas from Web 2.0 and cable providers. Sequentially, Service Provider revenue for the quarter was down 11% due to declines across all 3 geographies. Enterprise revenue was $384 million, down 3% year-over-year and sequentially. APAC and EMEA were down in the broader enterprise market year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services. By product area, Routing product revenue was $533 million, down 12% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The declines were driven by weakness in the carrier market in both core and edge. We saw good traction in both the PTX and MX2020 product lines. Enterprise Routing was healthy. Switching product revenue was $155 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by QFX into service providers, partially offset by a decline in the EX, mainly in the broad enterprise market. Sequentially, Switching product revenues declined 22%, coming off a record revenue in Q2. The decline was the result of lower demand from our Web 2.0 and softness from our broad enterprise customers. Security product revenue was $121 million, down 16% year-over-year but up 9% versus last quarter. Our SRX platform and security software were down 6% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially, mainly as a result of increased demand by service providers. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 65.2% compared to 64.4% a year ago and 64.2% last quarter. The improvements were driven by an increase in both product and services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.1%, up 0.7 points from both a year ago and last quarter, mainly due to favorability in product mix and reductions in costs. Non-GAAP gross margins for services were 63%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 2.5 points versus last quarter. The increases were due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and savings from variable costs. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $493 million, well below the range we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus on cost as well as the benefit of reduced variable costs in the quarter. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 9,059, which includes approximately 200 employees who transitioned as a result of the sale of the Junos Pulse business. Adjusting for the exiting Pulse employees, headcount declined 7% versus Q4 of 2013. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.7 points due to continued cost reductions. We experienced 0.1 point sequential of decline due to lower revenue, partially offset by improved gross margins and lower operating expenses. The non-GAAP tax rate was 27% compared to 26% last quarter as a result of the increase in the mix of U.S.-based taxable income. The GAAP tax rate was 37.4% compared to 24.9% in Q2 due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and other onetime items. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2 billion of net cash and investments. The decline was primarily due to the capital return of $594 million. Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 26% of total gross cash balance. For the quarter, we saw a net cash outflow from operations of $79 million, mainly due to timing differences in working capital, specifically an increase in accounts receivable, payments for incentive comp, tax payment and a reduction in deferred revenue. In Q4, we expect to return to our historical pattern of strong positive cash flows. DSO was 49 days, up from 41 days last quarter due to the timing of shipments and invoicing linearity. Capital expenditures were $43 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $44 million. Now I will provide our outlook for Q4. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. The demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers continues to be challenging. We have good relationships and design wins with these customers. However, the timing of deployments and improved demand is uncertain. At this stage, we are taking a prudent and cautious stance on revenue over the next several quarters. As previously mentioned, we completed the sale of Junos Pulse, and the quarterly revenue impact of approximately $30 million has been factored into the Q4 guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,025,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. Operating margins are expected to be 18.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 435 million. I'm also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, using the midpoint of Q4 guidance, revenues are expected to be approximately $4,576,000,000. Gross margins will be approximately 64%. Operating expenses will be approximately $2,030,000,000, and operating margins will be just under 20%. EPS is expected to be approximately $1.35. Excluding Junos Pulse revenues of $95 million for the first 3 quarters of 2014, Pulse adjusted full year revenue will be about $4,480,000,000. Now I'd like to move into a discussion of how we are planning the business for 2015. We see the long-term demand drivers as healthy, and we are confident in our innovation pipeline. We continue to earn good design wins across our carrier, web services, cable and enterprise accounts. That said, we are planning for the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters as near-term factors are impacting demand from our largest Service Provider customers. Given this market environment, we are targeting 2015 operating expenses of $1,900,000,000, plus or minus $25 million. This is a $130 million reduction for our estimated full year 2014 operating expense levels and translates to a $260 million aggregate IOP commitment. To achieve these additional savings, we will continue to carefully manage headcount, drive efficiency improvements and prioritize revenue-generating projects and resources. As part of our ongoing commitment to drive shareholder value, we also announced earlier today that the board has approved an additional $1.1 billion to the previously authorized capital return program. This brings our total capital return commitment to shareholders, including dividends, to $4.1 billion through 2016. As a reminder, our original IOP commitment was to return $3 billion to shareholders through 2016. We have been opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count and have paid our first dividend. This brings the total return to shareholders through the end of Q3 2014 to $1.8 billion. We expect to continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count given the current market conditions, and we are currently expecting to complete a minimum of $1.5 billion in aggregate share repurchases before the end of Q2 2015. Given these additional actions, even with a cautious revenue outlook, we expect significant year-over-year operating margin and earnings per share expansion in 2015. In summary, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and growth. I am very proud of our team and thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now let's open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : You gave some color on your expected operating expenses for 2015. Can you also let us know if you expect to grow next year? And can you help us understand how you're thinking about Q1 seasonality given the weaker second half? And then despite fairly soft router sales, you suggested fundamentals in the business remained healthy. So I was hoping to understand what's driving confidence here in this market. And given the carrier focus on NFV technologies and reducing costs, what leads you to believe the business will snap back in the second half? Shaygan Kheradpir : Jess, this is Shaygan. I'll make a few comments and I'll pass it to Robyn. One, I would say that the visibility to revenue in the near term, in the next few quarters, is poor. And this is because we're going through a cycle, as you know, and these cycles take 2 to 4 quarters. We think it started last quarter. Plus, in our last earnings call, we also mentioned that there are some specific dynamics in the carrier market in the U.S. So put them all together, it gives us poor visibility into the near future on revenues. Because we think these cycles typically take 2 to 4 quarters, at this point in time, our planning assumption is that growth will return in the second half of 2015. And we're planning our business accordingly. Robyn, do want to say a few words? Robyn M. Denholm: No, I think that's very good, Shaygan. In terms of the near-term environment, as we mentioned, for the fourth quarter, our guidance -- we obviously put that number out there. And then we do expect that we're in this 2- to 4-quarter cycle, as Shaygan talked about. For the full year next year, we're not putting out specific revenue numbers. As Shaygan mentioned, the environment is challenging. We expect that to continue for the next several quarters. So our planning assumptions at this point is that we expect that challenging environment to continue through the first half of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi from UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Shaygan, if I look at Juniper over the last 4 years, you had an up year, a down year, an up year, a down year. And it seems like the company is becoming increasingly cyclical. So I guess I wanted to get your thoughts. We talk a lot about a lot of secular underlying drivers, but we're not quite seeing it in your business. And so would love to get your thoughts in terms of can we get a secular growth trajectory for Juniper or is the company increasingly now cyclical? Shaygan Kheradpir : Amitabh, good question. I mean, if you look at the curves, your statement is actually correct. It looks like sinusoids going back many years. But you also -- the other observation is the magnitude of the sinusoids are coming down in terms of how they swing. What I can say is our business is increasingly diversified. If you look at it this year, Amitabh, most of our growth has come from Web 2.0s, a little bit from cable and so forth. So our strategic vertical that these are selected, we selected them for this specific purpose because we think, be it cable, carrier, Web 2.0, financial services, federal government and so forth, these are the verticals that are going to carry us forward. And we think while some are taller than others in terms of growth capability, we think over the medium to long term, they're going to be within -- I mean, some of them are going to be within the same zone. So we see continued diversity of revenue, but we are -- traditionally has been -- we have a carrier base. And as you know, the carrier CapEx cycles do exist, and it's something that we don't control industry spend. And when they swing down, we swing down with them. And when they go up, we go up with them. But now we have these other 3 engines, and we expect them to grow over time. Robyn, any more comments on that? Robyn M. Denholm: I think -- I think that said it well. I think also the question around the router cycles and whether we expect them to continue, I think Rami can comment on that as well. Rami Rahim : Sure, happy to. I mean, when I look at the Routing fundamentals, obviously the first thing you're going to look at is traffic. And all our indication is that traffic continues to grow across all of our customer base, whether it be the Web service providers, telcos, cable operators. I think that's sort of a truth among all of them. There are certainly trends that are happening in the industry and where -- these are obviously trends that we factor into our strategy. But when you take a look at these trends, whether they be Layer 4 to Layer 7, service virtualization or things like the virtualization of the CPE, so low-end routing virtualization or SDN for the purpose of automation, I view these as all largely complementary to our strategy. So this is very much an opportunity for us. It's very, very difficult to virtualize the kind of product, or I'd say impossible, to virtualize the kind of product that solved the performance necessary to deal with capacity growth. So this is why I'm confident in the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Pierre Felgaru (sic) [Pierre Ferragu] from Bernstein. Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So you -- on the Service Provider front, you mentioned specific dynamics that prevent the carriers to spend in the near term. I think we understand well what's happening in the U.S. You have like the debate with Netflix. You have like net neutrality. You have ongoing merger discussions. But what was very surprising this quarter is actually weakness of your revenues in the rest of the world. You mentioned China. You mentioned Eastern Europe. You mentioned Japan as well. Could you maybe review these geographies one by one? And maybe tell us -- it's probably like 2, 3 major clients in each of them. So it would be helpful to get some kind of color on what's happening, what's creating this lack of visibility in these regions as well? Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks, Pierre, for the question. Actually, we have Vince Molinaro here, who is our Executive Vice President for go-to-market globally. And he -- Vince, can you respond to Pierre... Vincent J. Molinaro: Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question, Pierre. Like Robyn discussed and mentioned, we were down in Asia Pacific, primarily because of China and Japan, largely due to Service Provider and a few projects that have come to conclusion. And we have seen a first half with some real good design wins that will carry forward. As I look into Q4, in Asia Pacific in general, look to flat to slightly up. And the reason for that, from my perspective, we're seeing growth in Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Southeast Asia in general for opportunities for the broad portfolio. Rami just mentioned traffic growth, and specifically in that part of the world, LTE and mobile build-outs presenting opportunities for us in access and aggregation in mobile backhaul as well as traditional core routing, edge and security. I'll also say in Asia Pacific, the focus in our verticals is beginning to resonate with both our Service Provider and Enterprise customers, particularly in Web and in cloud provider, Web 2.0 companies in India and Japan. So hopefully, that rounds out the picture for you. In EMEA -- in EMEA, I kind of characterize that steady as they go. Good first half. And again, as Robyn mentioned, some geopolitical issues in Eastern Europe and Middle East. We are seeing good traction with new design wins across the entire portfolio. And again, that is in our Enterprise and our Service Provider business across all verticals and even in the strategic verticals like higher education, for example. I think the other area of opportunity, the European providers, they typically invest as the demand presents itself. Traffic is growing in EMEA, 38% to 50% in the public space year-on-year. High network utilization, so we're -- and everything mobile. And that growth is pretty significant. So we're watching the industry dynamic and in the geographies that Robyn mentioned. But in general, we just see a steady trend going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup. Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I have a couple of clarifications first before my question. First of all, Robyn, I just want to make sure that you didn't mention anything about the 25% operating margin target for 2015. If you can comment on that, if that's still on the table. You didn't mention it, so I'll put that out there as a clarification. Lower OpEx, another clarification. How much of that, Robyn, was reversal of prior bonus accruals so not really where the OpEx would've been if we were doing it on a quarter-by-quarter basis? Third, Switching, obviously, fell pretty substantially and you gave some good reasons. I'm assuming within that, was it mainly the Web guys you're talking about? Are there other verticals that we should just be aware of in there? Was U.S. Service Provider in there? And then finally, Kathleen, I know you're going to love this, but AT&T CapEx, if you look at what they did, they're obviously a big part of what you guys do and dictate a lot. They were very strong in the first half of the year. They haven't change their full year number, $21 billion. It's still pretty much set in stone. So if you mapped out AT&T's CapEx, wireless, wireline, however you slice it, the fall-off in Q3 and the further fall-off in Q4 was put in stone back in June, July. So what really did change as you went through this quarter that seemed to be a surprise versus what AT&T was telling you? Was it kind of a mix in that CapEx number? Because the total CapEx number seems to kind of flow with what your new numbers are versus what you had previously thought going into the preannouncement. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you, Ehud. So there were 4 comments there, 2 clarifications, 2 questions. We will address 2 of them, 1 clarification and 1 question. Which would like them to be? Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. How about the lower OpEx bonus accruals for the clarification and then the AT&T CapEx question for the question. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. All right. You got it. Thanks, Ehud. Robyn M. Denholm: So I'll address the OpEx question. So you're right, we did have some variable comp in the quarter in Q3. I actually called it out in the script. We said it was about $10 million in terms of the fourth quarter guidance. So in other words, we did 4 -- we're putting out $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. There's about $8 million to $10 million in there that's variable-comp related. Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes. And Ehud, on your second question, obviously, we don't comment on any specific customer. So let me make my comments general. And in fact, I read your report. Nice job on the one you've just recently written on another customer on the same issue. And I think it's -- you can project that to my comments. So it's -- as you said, it's the mix and where service providers are spending their money and what part of the network. That's the answer to the question, essentially. And so it is -- if that's in the mix area, that is the answer to the question. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Ehud. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Northland. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : My question is, I think, a number of us on this side do worry a little bit about the declining R&D budget and to make sure that the pipeline continues to generate the technical -- technically leading products that you are known for. Could you give us a little bit -- perhaps maybe a bit of an example of how you can be reducing the R&D and yet continuing to not suffer from a thinner pipeline of product or maybe an example of where the efficiency has come into play? I think that would be helpful. Shaygan Kheradpir : So Jeff, I'll make a few comments and I'll then have Rami go into perhaps examples and give more color. So first of all, in the whole Integrated Operating Plan, the issue has been focus and unleashing the talent of our best R&D and go-to-market people for innovation. And so we said that many, many times we know R&D is the lifeblood of this company. In fact, I am super excited about the product pipeline, and this is not infinity. This is in front of us. So you should rest assured that innovation and engineering and product pipeline is healthy. It's broad. It's deep and it's very exciting. And so you should just rest assured on that. And we are very focused to ensure that our R&D is focused on things that matter to the customers, where the market is going and making sure that we are not wasting our resources in areas that don't matter. Now with that, I'll pass it to Rami. Rami Rahim : Sure. So most of, if not all, of the changes that we've done in R&D to reduce the OpEx have been structural in nature. So it's around streamlining the organization in such a way that allows us to deduplicate functions that were, quite frankly, duplicated only because of the organizational design. So that has been eliminated. Beyond that, we've been very, very vigilant with respect to the priorities of the projects that we're working on, making sure that everything that we are working on is aligned 100% with the company's strategy. And as you know, we've said in the past, that has resulted in stopping development of certain projects and products. So there are a number of pre-revenue-generating projects we were working on that we are not anymore. We just divested the Pulse business as you are aware of not because it's a bad business but because of the fact that we could not invest in it ourselves and also all of the other things that we know we need to do for the company's strategy. The last thing I will say is now that all of R&D is in a single organization, one of the fundamental tenets, if you will, of our engineering principles is to leverage, is to make sure that all of our technology components across silicon systems and software are highly leverageable across all of our product lines. And this is something that we're very much executing towards. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks, Rami. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : If I look at the year-over-year decline, it's actually the worst in the company's history since the IPO. And that's despite the company being more diversified and despite traffic growing every single year. So underneath the cyclical nature, is there a fundamental change that's going on in the business? Is there an increasing structural issue, price deflation, shifts in purchasing power by carriers? And if that's the case, we understand you're addressing the OpEx for the cyclical part, but what are the plans to address the structural part? Shaygan Kheradpir : Mark, yes. I think if you look at the numbers, the overwhelming majority of this is carriers. It's U.S. carriers. It is the cyclical nature of their buying. Once you open that cover, there are things. There are pluses and minuses, and they always are in the business. But I would say is that is the bulk of the issue that we saw in the third quarter. Robyn, do want to say a few words on that? Robyn M. Denholm: No, I think that covered it, actually. Operator : Next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask a clarification and a question as well. Just on the clarification, again, I wanted to follow up on the question on 25% operating margin for next year, if that's still on the table as your target. And then my question was just digging in a little bit into the Switching business given the sharp decline there. Can you just characterize for us a little bit how lumpy that business is in terms of customer concentration? Are there are a handful of maybe 10%, 15% customers in there that could have driven the magnitude that we saw in the decline? Shaygan Kheradpir : Simona, I'll take a crack at that quickly at both, and then on the second one, I'll pass it again to Rami. So on the first one, 25% is our long-term target and very achievable. The visibility to revenue, as you know, has turned quite poor just in the past 6 weeks. If you look at the CapEx numbers from the big carriers, you would see how they have changed and it's just the past 4 to 6 weeks. What we control is our costs, our products, our customer relationships, the design wins. All of those are well in hand. We've got great customer relationships, a lot of design wins. On the costs, we have given you definitive numbers, which is 1.9, minus 25, plus 25. And based on our track record on our costs so far, you can see how we come with costs. We're doing that while preserving ability to invest sufficiently for growth despite the challenging environment. And when you put it all together, we're going to expand operating margins significantly from 2014 to 2015. And this is just arithmetic, this number, depends on revenue. And revenue, we don't control industry spend. The visibility is poor. And these things can change very quickly. They have just in the past 6 weeks. And so whenever -- and we are constructive on the second half of this year. We think we're going to get growth back. That will depend on the revenue number. But we are very focused on the 25%, and we think it's very achievable as a long-term target. Rami Rahim : Switching. So should I comment on Switching? Simona, so first, to your question about concentration. Certainly, there is a Service Provider and an Enterprise component to our Switching business. The Service Provider component tends to be fewer larger deals, fewer larger customers than the Enterprise. That's natural. We've always said that the SP portion is going to be lumpy, and this quarter was certainly an example of that. And I would say, I mean, we're certainly disappointed in our results. I think we can and will do better in Switching. So what gives me confidence about the Switching business going forward? First is we've had a number of wins that just haven't yet been -- gone into deployment mode that will kick in, in future quarters. Second is if you take a look at what we've done in Switching in terms of R&D over the last couple of years is we've realigned the organization. We've focused it on a new strategy and product roadmap, and we're now just starting to see the results of that strategy in terms of new products like the QFX5100 being a great example of that. But we're not done yet, and there's more to come. And I have a lot of confidence in what is more to come in terms of our ability to grow this business. And I'll just pass it to Vince for performance. Vincent J. Molinaro: Yes. Now let me just tag on that, Rami, with respect to Shaygan mentioned the vertical focus and the customer differentiation. We're starting to see both in Service Provider and in Enterprise a number of data center wins to leverage the portfolio and positioning forward, especially in the massively scalable data centers. We're seeing a much broader architectural conversation that puts us in a position for continued growth. So I'm excited about that. And then automation and everything else that's going on relative to the environment in the data center, looking forward to again diversity and portfolio of customers where we have applications that position and drive our Switching business. So thanks. Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes. And I'll just wrap it up, Simona, on -- as Rami and Vince said, I'm actually very encouraged by all of the vertical engagements on Switching and the design wins, and I'm enthusiastic about the ramp in 2015. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Simona. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I think when you [indiscernible] data, about whether it's a cyclical issue in Routing or if there's something more structural going on, like maybe Metro Optical using that Switching substitution for some of the Routing. The question is really around Switching in terms of -- are you guys planning to do a spine switch? This is clearly an area as you note that you could see some growth in because there's still growth in Switching and you have a small market share. So are you going to do anything architecturally to really get into that market in a bigger way? Shaygan Kheradpir : Brian, we obviously are not here to unveil our product roadmap. Suffice it to say, as I said, I'm personally very excited about it. And I think it was Brian's report we just recently read, right? We have a lot of comments on that, but that we'll take up online. But Rami, can you sort of take that? Rami Rahim : Sure. So look, on the Switching side, I'll just sort of revert back to what I mentioned for Simona, which is that we're not done with our roadmap. We're not going to get into specifics on this call. But I think there's a lot of confidence all around on our roadmap. And in terms of talking to customers, we're getting a lot of very positive feedback on the roadmap. As far as Metro optical and so forth, there are certainly trends and aspirations by all involved in that market. And one can easily talk about IP and packet-based transport and so forth, but actually executing on that, there aren't that many people in the world that can effectively do it and do it competitively and scalably. So for that reason, I'm not 100% sure I agree with the premise that there is sort of this long-drawn-out trend, if you will, in Routing where everything will move to optical. I just don't buy it. That said, there are -- there is an evolution in architectures for the Metro and even for the core where the packet and optical demands will be much closely integrated together. This will be done with things like intelligent software that can balance traffic more effectively across the 2 layers, also done in terms of automation. And if you look at our product roadmap with respect to, for example, NorthStar, this is the controller that does exactly that. It does it with our own packet technology and partner optical technology. And we're seeing, actually, some very good interest from customers. I think it's early, but we're seeing very good interest from customers on such approaches. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Back to the Switching question. Could you just -- I think the Enterprise number for Switching might have been below as well what you were thinking at the beginning of the quarter. And what did you notice competitively there with Cisco ramping new products and Arista doing things? And I guess everybody's asking 2 questions so I'll sneak one other in there. Strategically, you guys have done the IOP and the Junos divestiture. But is there any other strategic options on the table? Anything else that we should be thinking about that you have in your ability to enhance shareholder value that we haven't looked at yet in the analyst community? Shaygan Kheradpir : Ben, I'll make a couple of quick comments and then I'll pass it around. So on Switching, we are actually quite bullish about our Switching products. They really shine most where scale, sophistication, openness, programmability, hardened IP protocols, those things matter. And so we are very bullish about that. As far as your comment, your second comment, we -- as a matter of course, we review our portfolio regularly. And we are in that sort of phase and that's how our process works. So we do that regularly. But Rami, can you take a crack on the Enterprise question specifically? Rami Rahim : Yes. I mean, most of the -- most of what affected us in Q3 in Switching was on the SP -- in SPs. And that's, again, the lumpier portion of our business. There was also a broader Enterprise component, but it was a minor component compared to the SP side. As far as strategy is concerned, it's scoring and winning more and more of the opportunities from customers that truly, like Shaygan said, value high capacity and high scale. And those customers tend to be fewer and larger. So there is -- again, there's that lumpiness component to it. And then also, like I said, there is still an element to our product roadmap that has not yet been completed that I think is going to be necessary to make sure that we continue the growth. So that's, again, what it is that we're counting on for continued growth in the future. Vincent J. Molinaro: And I think from a customer perspective, you've seen the announcement on Nike, and that is a complete portfolio but switch-led. And those are the kinds of opportunities, when you take the full portfolio, leveraging the competence and capability of our switch platform, allows us to get into these global data centers, allows us to provide the agility both on a converged campus as well as among data centers to deliver private cloud. And so I think that's a good example, and it's just a ramp and replication of more opportunities like that where we either lead with routing and pull the switch or lead with switch and pull the broader portfolio. And then I -- think about MetaFabric in general, which is the Routing, Switching, Security where we can lead with that enabling switch technology and pull through the entire portfolio and create that end-to-end solution for customers like Nike and others that we're winning designs around that need to move into production. But it is that better together with leveraging the switch and pulling the rest. MetaFabric is, I think, a perfect example of that. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thank you, Ben. Operator : Our next question comes from Kulbinder from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. I guess my question is that you spoke before, Shaygan, about the product cycle, and it normally lasts 2 to 4 quarters. I guess the question is -- this still seems to have materially surprised Juniper. So my question is what is it about the product cycle that surprised you this time and transpired because you -- you have had these cycles before, but this seems to have caught Juniper by surprise again. And I guess just linked to that, I guess the secular concern would be is there something more serious competitive going on, and how would you respond to that kind of concern? Shaygan Kheradpir : Yes, I mean, it's a good question. It's difficult to call cycles. I think there are a number of analysts on this call right now and I'm not sure how many of us would have called the cycle. And as I said, in addition to that, there is some -- what also complicated it in terms of visibility, Kul, is some specific industry dynamics that is going on. So those 2 together make visibility quite poor, and the industry dynamics isn't one. It's probably, I would say, half a dozen things, and some of them are different on one customer than the other. And then on top of it, you've got the sinusoid with noise fluctuating around it. So I guess that's the answer. And we all wished that we could tell the cycles, but we didn't see it and I don't think many people did either. And in fact, just in the past 6 weeks, we've gotten -- the numbers have moved on CapEx as well on the area that we work. Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess just on the... Shaygan Kheradpir : Rami, do you have any other comments? Kathleen Nemeth : Go ahead, Kulbinder, and then we'll take one more question. Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. I guess my question and follow-up would be just you mentioned the need for revenue diversity. With the new products, the new projects, is it fair to say that you would have the revenue diversity in a year that you can mitigate some of this going forward beyond that? Is that what it might take to get this diversity of revenue that you think Juniper might need? Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. I think, Kulbinder, on the diversity of revenue, that obviously takes time. And we will have more information next week at the Investor Day on how diverse some of our revenue has gotten over the last 5 years. But to Shaygan's point, we obviously still have some concentration around carriers. And in particular, when those cycles happen, sometimes it's very difficult to get visibility into the depth or breadth of the cycle. And so you're right, the depth of it did exceed our expectations in this quarter. But our view is, at this point, that we're planning for the revenue environment to be challenging. And we've obviously taken appropriate actions in terms of the cost structure and making sure that we're investing in the right things over the right period of time to catch the wave of growth as we come out of this cycle. And that's what the team is very focused on doing. Shaygan Kheradpir : Thanks, Robyn. Thanks, Kul. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : She's been killing names all night. Ittai. Yes. I guess my question is more on the incremental OpEx cuts. Shaygan, Robyn, I know cuts are never easy. And when you first announced the IOP plan, you had a very heavy OpEx structure where, I would say, on a relative basis, it was easier to identify the cost-cutting. I guess the question from here, how easy or difficult is it to squeeze that extra $100 million out there? Are the things that you need to do a bit more structural and longer in duration in order to squeeze those cuts? Or they can be -- whether either easily identified or quickly extracted? Can you give us some color on the process there? That would be great. Shaygan Kheradpir : Ittai, yes, we did IOP that we announced in February for $160 million. We are doing $100 million more. On a year-over-year basis, it's $130 million more in OpEx savings that we are doing. It's a variety of actions. I would say the first $160 million we did, it was tilted more heavily towards the structural things we need to do. Robyn will talk to some of that. This one, we've got a little bit of that. But we also, in IOP, said that we are also sharpening that muscle of continuous focus on efficiency and ensuring that all our dollars go to where it matters most. And this is a reflection of the company strengthening that muscle to be able to take yet another 130 million year-over-year out while preserving a very exciting R&D portfolio, and as Robyn said, be in a position to catch the revenue growth that, from a planning perspective, we are announcing in the second half of next year. Robyn? Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, I think Shaygan said it well. What we're trying to do -- what we are doing is continuing to sharpen our focus in terms of productivity and efficiency across the company. And as you could see by the results for the third quarter, we are ahead of plan of the original IOP. And so our view is that we can take these additional costs out. It's never easy to take cost out, as you mentioned in your question. But with the right focus and the right attention, doing that deliberately across the company by managing headcount and continuing to work through discretionary expenses as well as effectiveness and efficiency across the company. And the team's very well aligned around that. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Ittai. Okay. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you for participating on the call and your great questions, in some cases clarifications. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Please note that today\u2019s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per phone. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper. First, let\u2019s talk about what we have accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiative designed to streamline our organization, reduced our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment. In many areas we exceeded our commitment by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectiveness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company. Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper, and we believe that our best days are still ahead. To that end, let me share with you what I have been up to in my first few months as CEO. I have spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set out key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of routing, switching and security for both service providers and enterprise customers. I appointed Jonathan Davidson as Head of Juniper\u2019s Development and Innovation or JDI to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require. I moved network automation project that have graduated out of the incubation phase from the office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business including our capabilities and product roadmap. While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performs across a range of metric, I will, as I always have try to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art and network innovation, and drive long-term growth for the company. I\u2019ll spend some time now articulating our strategy. How we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives. First, our strategy, we will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost effective networks, while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation. We will focus on customers and partners across our key verticals, who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation with the relentless customer focus will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market. Second, on execution, our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across routing, switching and security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline, which has never been better and will offer our customers break through performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry. In security, I acknowledge that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our security revenue. To win insecurity, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus our network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and service provider mobile infrastructure. To emphasis, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I am confident that we will do just that. And importantly, we will be employing a high leverage development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper. Our common threat through all of this is our Junos based SRX platform, which is adaptable to serve all of this environment and can accommodate the security needs of any number of different use cases. With this new strategy in effect, we will be delivering substantial enhancements to the SRX platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and we have energized team focus on helping our customer get in front of their security challenges. Our exciting product portfolio along with our focus go-to-market models are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies. I\u2019d like to turn now to the macroenvironment and our business. I am confident in Juniper\u2019s future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long-term. In the near-term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending. However, we do expect an improvement in spending in the later half of this year. We have signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full four quarters cycles that we have historical seen. Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investment in the second half of this year. Although 2014 routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continue to see growth in routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure. In switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. It will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance in automation in the datacenter switching space. Let me announce that expectations moving forward. While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumption. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next three years. We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plans that we have been executing again. To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiative. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly. In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliency through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as one Juniper. And I\u2019m proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015. Robyn Denholm : Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases, as well as give you the context of the goodwill impairment charge. We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was the tightened focus of our security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our security resources to the SRX platform. Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plans. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4. For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we\u2019ve made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders. Now, I\u2019d like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, we will perform a regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated non-cash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our security reporting unit. There are several factors which contributed to this impairment including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our assets to refocus our security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse. Combined these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecast needed to support the historical security goodwill valuation. I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper\u2019s cash balance, operating cash flows or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth targets that we outlined at our October investor meeting. Now, let\u2019s return to an analysis of the Q4 result. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates have been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse. Overall, revenue and demands of the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the things that we have discussed over the last six months remain consistent. That is large U.S. carrier demand continues to be vague but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC service providers and improving enterprise demand. Looking at our demand metrics, products book to bill was much greater than one. We exceeded 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102 billion, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41, excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and the positive impact of $0.06 from reduced checkout. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure. For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19. Included in this result is $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse. Now let\u2019s look at revenue results in detail by the product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. Year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers partially offset by strength in cloud providers. Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products. Security product revenue was $97 million, rather disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers, as well as the continued declines from ScreenOS products. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 64.1%, compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.3%, down six-tenths of a point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix. Non-GAAP services gross margins was 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and six-tenths of a point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range and down $74 million, or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the additional cost savings commitment announced on our Q3 2014 earnings call, as well as the significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter. Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due to our significant focus on cost reduction efforts. The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million of one-time benefits from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%. The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is the non-deductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss the 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532 billion, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cables and a steady performance from enterprise. While we are not happy with the overall results, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer service and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customers\u2019 segment. We are adding product revenues and finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers. Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013. This is a good result and represents the value our customers\u2019 same innovation, as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offsets both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure. I\u2019m pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2.15 billion of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in OpEx allowed us to expand non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7%, despite the challenging revenue environment. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year, as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year. GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of the $0.45 impact of restructuring and other charges. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year. DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to foster our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transition some of that distributor financing to Juniper\u2019s balance sheet through a targeted financial services program with certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in a range of 45 to 55 days. Now, I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect that demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015. As we have said, we are two quarters into what we expect to be a full quarter cycle and as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumption. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range from $1.20 billion to $1.60 billion. Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5% at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume. Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million and as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings. We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance. And we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% for the first quarter, assuming no extensions of the R&D tax credit for 2015. We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately $420 million. I\u2019m also pleased to report that the Board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe on your -- on all the comments you\u2019ve made on the service provider outlook, do you have a sense from technicians you had with your clients of what drove so relatively sudden slowdown in spending that started about a couple of quarters ago? And/or so what would be the driver behind like recovering, spending in the second half of the year? And then beyond the -- of course beyond the U.S. and the rest of the world, if you could give us a bit of flavor of how the service provider business is likely to reply for you in 2015. What I am wondering of course is, if we have a recovery in the second half of 2015 in the U.S. and if it becomes more clearly visual for you, is there a risk of seeing the sustaining in the rest of the world? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thank you, Pierre. So let me just address your first question, which is around the service provider outlook, primarily here in the United States. There are number of factors that we look at. Obviously as we talk to our customers and we engage with them very closely, number one would be things around the timing of projects that we\u2019ve been working with them on. We are looking obviously at macro trends that are happening around M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that are large service provider customers that are currently expecting to undertake spectrum auctions. All of these have contributed to our assessment, but it makes sense for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that engagement, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels would start to recover in the second half of this year. On your second question, which is more around the geo-profile for service providers, and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I will touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in just from your question. In EMEA, I am actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we\u2019re seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products as a build-out converged infrastructures and we are actually seeing some good momentum in the quarter as well in the Q4 timeframe. And in APAC, there its bit more of a complex answer because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than the outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser-focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it\u2019s very much a partner-led model in doing so. And that can result in some lumpiness. Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4. But generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking, outside of China, as you look at South Asia for example, there based on a number of wins that we\u2019ve had historically and ongoing projects that we are working on, we are actually doing quite well and I am pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Ehud Gelblum : Hey, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. Couple of things. First of all, Rami, just an open-ended question, I know, it\u2019s been more specific. But the open-end question is, what difference are you -- you\u2019re making a lot of difference I\u2019m sure, but what different strategies have you set in place vis-\u00e0-vis website I was doing when you first came in and I did a full review of the product portfolio and took a look at couple businesses, continues posting one of that sold? Are there any other fundamental things that you\u2019re changing or are you basically just taking current strategy that was there before that you obviously had a lot to do with and continuing it nicely? I have a follow-up that\u2019s more specific [indiscernible]? Rami Rahim : Okay. Let me address that question, thanks Ehud. So first, yes, you are right, you have to keep in mind that I was a part of the leadership team that developed, created that strategy and it\u2019s a strategy that I very much believe in. It\u2019s a strategy that from a go-to-market standpoint is laser-focused on key verticals that we believe will value the types of technologies and products that we develop and where we have the maximum chance of success. It\u2019s a strategy where from an R&D standpoint, we\u2019re really executing on the performance, scale capabilities that customers require, but just as importantly the software-driven innovation around automation, absolutely fundamental. So, that all remains absolutely intact. And we are executing towards that. There are changes or twist to the strategy as it pertains to security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront. But just to reiterate, we are pivoting away from thinking about security from a standpoint of Point products. We are moving much more towards integrated solutions across switching, routing and security that address domain level problems that our customers want from us. And we are executing on a very high leverage strategy and engineering across switching, routing and security. I will just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing, or as I should say silicon and software that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance, scale and capabilities of our security products, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be executing on now. Kathleen Nemeth : You had a follow-up. Go ahead. Okay. The next question. Operator : Certainly, the next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask how much visibility you have into the ramp in the second half with some of your U.S. carrier customers and specifically the timing of the domain sort of ramp that you\u2019ve been designed into? And taking that into account, assuming that those customers can normalize in the second half do you think it\u2019s possible for your revenues for the year to grow as a whole? Rami Rahim : Okay. So as far as the service provider timing, nobody has a crystal ball that tells us exactly what is going to be. But again based on the data that we gathered from our customer on an ongoing basis and understanding of the macro trends, we do believe second half will resume the growth that we had anticipated as we have said earlier Simona. I can\u2019t really talk about any specific projects, but I will say this, we are very tightly aligned with our large service provider customers, both here in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Everybody, many of our customers are looking at new approach to delivering services to their end users using cloud-based service delivery models. And I believe that we are very well-positioned with the products that we have [Technical Difficulty] having the strategy that we\u2019re executing on to set ourselves up to participate in the growth once it resumes. So I can\u2019t talk about any specific projects, but I can say, products like our virtual MX, products like the virtual SRX or what we call the Firefly that really represent a new way of service delivery using cloud-based models are exactly the kind of products that our customers are requesting today. And I think set ourselves up for success when spending starts to recover. Kathleen Nemeth : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ashwin Kesireddy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ashwin Kesireddy : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, could you comment on the strength in switching and how should we think about that going forward? Any color you could provide on the drivers of market share gains will be helpful. And I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the security features you\u2019re planning to add to SRX and give us more concrete timelines on when you\u2019re planning to add these new features. And then I\u2019ve got one question for Robyn. I was trying to understand some of the factors that could have influenced the timing of the impairment. Why did you decide to pay that now? Is it just due to normal year end process? Are there any changes in customer contracts or other factors that could have led to this? Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching and security and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around two, two and a half years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in switching or we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market in the roadmap that we are now executing towards. So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX5100, our OCX1100 product, which is essentially a Junos-based white box switch. These are just the beginning of what I would consider a very compelling product roadmap that our customers are going to respond very well to in switching. And I have alluded to in the past and I will just reiterate again that we will continue the rolling thunder if you will of new products and switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect. Now there are two dimensions to our switching business. There is, of course, the enterprise and the service provider. Service provider dimension has always been somewhat lumpy, and as a result of that predicting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy, but I expect to continue to take market share in switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy. In security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcements. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high leverage strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time. We\u2019re essentially leveraging technologies that we have already developed in the company but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities. And they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threat factors in the competition. Robyn? Robyn Denholm : And so Ashwin, let me just address the goodwill and the timing of the impairment charge. We do a regular review of the current value of goodwill as required under GAAP. In Q4, the underperformance of the security revenues continued and so we took another look at that. In Q4, we also took into account the other factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around the restructuring that we have done in that business area in the security roadmaps and then also the pivot on the strategy as well. So all of those, as Rami mentioned before, culminated after his review of the security portfolio and so it\u2019s the combination of factors. It\u2019s not one factor that led us to impair the goodwill, the continuing underperformance and the product rationalization that we\u2019ve completed now. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Sue : Thank you. Rami, security, are we too lead into security at no longer standalone products in the future. Will you be leading and integrating it into routing and switching platforms, and is that something that customers are asking for? And then, Robyn on cash, you are returning more than your annual cash flow in buybacks and dividends. How should we think of cash flow from operations going forward? I think it\u2019s around $800 million a year, maybe if you could just help us understand cash generation here versus abroad and the subsequent appropriate debt-to-equity ratio for Juniper? Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the security question first and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. I believe, the industry is moving in the direction in which securities increasingly being intimately tied with switching and routing, where understanding traffic pattern and flows through switches and routers actually allow you to improve your security posture, substantially, overall, when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the service provider edge. So that\u2019s effectively the strategy that we\u2019re going to be executing towards. It does involve building security products and they are going to be very effective security products, but those products are going to be very much integrated if you will from a solution standpoint to switching and routing. They\u2019re going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across three of these product lines. So think of it from the standpoint of lots of cost synergies from the leveraging of technology, as well as revenue energy, very commensurate with what I believe that the industry is heading toward and how they think about the combinations of these products. Robyn? Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Rami. And so, Mark, in terms of the cash position, as we mentioned that, we had strong operating cash flows for the year of 2014 about $763 million. We do generate cash strongly from the business in terms of our operating cash flow. We did last year return more than our free cash flow to shareholders. On the past, we\u2019re on that task too and efficient capital structure as we\u2019ve outlined previously. And therefore, you would expect that to happen last year and through the first half of this year, we anticipate buying back about a billion dollar shares as we\u2019ve talked about before part of our repurchase and capital return program. In terms of overall debt to cash ratio, we are looking to maintain our investment grade rating and therefore, we\u2019ll be now financial means in order to maintain that rating. And so that is what we\u2019re doing as a company and we continuing to execute to that capital -- efficient capital structure, as well as our investment credit rating. Kathleen Nemeth : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. Sorry, I had to take it off mute. I have two quick questions. First one is about services, it declined 2.8% sequentially and in prior years it was always up in the fourth quarter. What is driving? I thought it's more stable source of revenue, so what is driving the decline? Second question is a follow-up \u2026.. Robyn Denholm : Tal. Sorry, I was going to answer that one for you. Tal Liani : All right. Robyn Denholm : Allow me to do that one for you? Tal Liani : Yes. Robyn Denholm : So, Tal, we provided to table in the slides. The decline was purely the result of the post divestiture. So when you normalize to that services for the post business, we\u2019re actually sequentially up. And so that business is very healthy as you see by the operating margins that we are yielding and actually the revenue continues to increase quite agnostically well. Tal Liani : Thank you. So the question is about security and I am trying to understand the decline this quarter because over the last three years, there were two parts of security. SRX was up and the old NetScreen was down. And the magnitude of the decline this quarter suggest that SRX also has issues in the quarter that we -- in the period of time, not just the quarter where we see all other security companies reporting very strong quarters, very strong results. And I\u2019m trying to understand what is wrong with SRX that is driving or what is missing, maybe it\u2019s a better way to phrase it? What is missing in SRX that is driving revenues down that much and how can you fix it? Can you discuss the parts that are weak and you are going to improve? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Sure, Tal. So you are right that there are two components to our security business. First is the NetScreen products or the ScreenOS products that have been in decline and continue to be decline, a fairly rapid decline in fact and now represents a relatively smaller fraction of our overall security business. The SRX products, they are the high end and the low end component and especially the high end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically they are service provider deals around the world. So, we did see that impacts us to some extent in the Q4 timeframe. But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I am not pleased or satisfied with the performance of our security business. I think we can and will do better and this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption. And that requires that we take a much more focused approach and ensuring that these products, the ones that you are asking about the Junos based products are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions of security and routing. That\u2019s exactly what we are going to be focusing on, and that\u2019s where you are going to see some of the enhancements that I have talked about coming out later this year. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Tal. Next question, Operator? Operator : Certainly. The next question is from Bill Choi of Janney. Please go ahead. Bill Choi : Okay. Thanks. Unfortunately, I\u2019m going to have to go back to security here as well. I guess the problem we are having Rami is security, if anything is getting more specialized, not generically integrated with networking component. So, I could see from Juniper\u2019s side how you could leverage your existing strengths and try to differentiate your solution. But which customers are actually asking for this? Is this kind of to Tal\u2019s question, what kind of competitive dynamics are you seeing? Are you losing, when you are just focusing on your prior strength of your scalability, flows session? I mean, these were good enough to win, lead your businesses with mobile customers who were actually buying a ton of Gi firewalls going forward. So that\u2019s probably the big one. Second just, if you guys could try to give a little more quantifications of the very positive comment on book-to-bill and perhaps kind of the visibility you might have on a product level basis, core versus edge routing and whether it\u2019s more of the switching design wins that you had that is converting into revenue? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Sure. Bill, thanks for the question. Let me address the security question and then I will hand it over to Robyn to talk about the financial metric that you are asking about. All right. The strategy that we need to be on is in fact the one that you are taking about right now, where we can -- we have to focus in areas where we can in fact be effective, where we actually have been effective historically. If for example, you are talking about the Gi firewall, their scale, performance, power efficiencies and the effectiveness of stopping attacks is very much there. And there are in fact synergies there with routing. And so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described or I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I have already invested in to improve my routing and switching, can be used very effectively and securities can be done and that\u2019s what we will do. So, I recognized that we are probably stretching your patience a little bit here with respect to this business. But I also want to emphasize that I\u2019ve taken now a thorough look as part of my onboarding as CEO. And I\u2019ve looked at, where it is that we should focus and where we should not focus. And as a result of that, we\u2019ve come out with this high-leverage strategy that I think will make us very competitive in the securities space. Robyn Denholm : And Bill, in terms of the book-to-bill, I can say that it was greater than one in fact I think much greater than one you replace with the book-to-bill, our backlog was at about $445 million exiting the year, roughly flat with the beginning of the fiscal year, which we\u2019ll replace about. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead. Amitabh Passi : Hi. Thank you. I had question and then a follow-up. I guess my first question was for you Robyn. The midpoint of your revenue guidance is roughly about $1.04 billion. I think for last quarter it was $1.05 billion but your guided gross margins at 64% plus or minus last quarter and this quarter at 63.5%. So nothing of fact, just curious why the 50 basis point reduction and should we expect things to normalize around 64% as we progress through the year? Robyn Denholm : Yes, but firstly thanks Amitabh. In terms of the gross margins to date, we did call out for the guidance range that there will be towards the low end of our long-term model that we\u2019re actually -- have been our long term targets that we called out in October. And then it\u2019s a fixed result of Q1 mix in all that volume reduction as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. In terms of the ongoing gross margin on place with the performance of gross margin as I\u2019ve mentioned for the full year of 2014, we were roughly flat with \u201913. That\u2019s really a reflection of the intense focus that we have on the cost side of the supply chain and also a reflection of the value that customers see in the innovation that we are bringing to market. And so as we move forward here, we expect to be in the range that I talked about at the Investor Day which is 64 plus or minus a bit. Amitabh Passi : I think there is still a lot of confusion out there in terms of what exactly vMX means for you for Juniper. Can you maybe clarify for us how exactly are you positioning the vMX? What are you hearing from your customers initially and how do they intend to buy the vMS versus your physical MX? Rami Rahim : Yeah, sure. Let me try to demystify it for you. So if you look at Juniper\u2019s routing business overall, vMX is in fact a router, just has to be a virtualized router. We make the bulk of our revenue in the high performance end of that range i.e. the larger systems are the systems that sell the most, just by virtue of the applications and the used cases that we are solving for our customers. There is also market out there for low end routers. It\u2019s a market that we are not as penetrated in today. It is a market where this trend of virtualization will in fact impact first because virtualization i.e. this movement of services in the case of virtual MX. It\u2019s a layer three routing service on to virtual machines that fit on standard servers is interesting in some -- and it\u2019s ability to deliver agility to our customers. But it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for their high-end applications where we already are very well penetrated today. So the net of what I\u2019ve just said is that, the Virtual MX represents a great opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environment and use cases for our customers. So where are our customers are thinking about deploying small PE router that the service provide edge, they now might consider using a Virtual MX software license, download it off of our website and deployed on a standard rack servers, that\u2019s a revenue opportunity for Juniper and of course, the profit opportunity for Juniper. So it\u2019s highly complimentary with the rest of our portfolio. It still, I don\u2019t -- I want to also set some expectation, because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market. But in developing and shipping this product, we are essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground to our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature rich products, a product like this is one that we are -- we have to be proud enough of to put the MX logo on it and that\u2019s essentially what we have done. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Next question. Operator : The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. Rami, I think a short way, in recent history all of you noticed that is, you are particularly focused on cloud opportunity and enterprise switching business. My question is, can you give us some breakdown between the cloud, data center portion of business than more generic to your assortment price campus use? And as we go forward, many metrics you can offer us in terms of number of customers, progress, et cetera, that speak to your success, to wonder you are another to go forward with respect to your switching business? And one additional question, with respect to your new products in 2015, switching and routing? How much of the growth you expect will come from these new products and given that historically, there is a lag period for any company between product introduction and revenue generation, you are assuming success? What is the timeframe? What do you expecting in terms of timeframe in that as well? Kathleen Nemeth : Paul, it\u2019s Kathleen. So we are as you know running closer on time, so which question would you like to prioritize? Paul Silverstein : We will go with the first one Kathleen? Kathleen Nemeth : All right. So the one on the cloud. Rami Rahim : Okay. So on the cloud and especially as it pertain to the switching opportunity. If you look at our business today, there -- the bulk of our switching product fell into either data center or some combination of data center and campus. And even when you look at the campus dimension of this, it\u2019s actually the larger, more mission critical campuses that we are going after, because quite frankly, it\u2019s geared toward customers that care about carrier class capabilities, performance and scalability that we address very well. So that is how I would look at the business today. Now as we start to introduce some of the new products. Certainly, we will have an opportunity to go deeper into these exiting opportunities and the enterprise for data center and mission critical campus. But we also open up new opportunities in the cloud providers and financial services in particular. That\u2019s how we\u2019d characterize where we are today and the opportunity going forward. I\u2019ll just touch very briefly on the second question which is a -- yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. Even if we introduce new products this year, there is the typical certification and qualification cycle that can take a quarter -- I should say few quarters by our customers. Enterprise customers will typical make that more on the lower end of the range, maybe a quarter to two quarters service by the customers could take nine months to a year of certification. Kathleen Nemeth : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group. Please go ahead. Subu Subrahmanyan : Thank you. Rami, I wanted to ask about customer segments. You made the point at analyst event, how the cloud operators now represent 16% of revenues versus 14% for the U.S. large service providers. So one part of the growth story is waiting for the U.S. service providers tend to get better, the other part is you have higher exposure to the growing parts. So can you talk about the puts and takes, maybe talk about what the growth rate you\u2019re seeing in the faster growing segments are and how much reliance you still have on U.S. service providers to get better to see growth return in the second half? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Sure, Subu. So certainly, you picked up on something that\u2019s very important, which is that -- and you see this in our Q4 results, in fact, which is that we have offset some of the weakness in the large U.S. service providers by diversifying our business across a number of key verticals including cloud providers and cable. That is by design, that is very much a function of our strategy. And I think that\u2019s a very healthy thing to do and we will continue to do just that. So whereas we anticipate a recovery in spending by our large service provider customers in the second half, we certainly are not counting completely on that. We\u2019re also executing on this high diversification strategy across all of our key verticals both from a go-to-market focus standpoint as well as from the solutions that we\u2019re developing for those verticals. Robyn Denholm : And Subu, if I can just add, in my prepared remarks today, I talked about the full year of 2014, just like at the Analyst Day, I talked about the three quarters through the end of Q3 of 2014. A similar sort of pattern as Rami mentioned happened in the fourth quarter as well. What we thought for the full year of 2014 is that the U.S. large service providers were actually down year-over-year and they were offset by growth in cable and content service providers. And that was the thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one because what it does is that it shows not only the diversification of the revenue but also the applicability of the technology and the solutions that we\u2019re developing across multiple customer segment and that includes the Enterprise, because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually a good performance for enterprise for the year. So, I think that is a very big part of the leverage strategy that Rami\u2019s talked about in terms of the product portfolio that we have and also going forward in terms of growth, targeting those areas that are going faster than the rest. Kathleen Nemeth : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brain Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Modoff : Yeah, guys. Question really on the switching side. You\u2019ve been really selling mainly top-of-rack switches, two main competitors in the spine switchovers than Cisco. I know you\u2019ve got to work in that area. When can we see a product and how you plan to target it from your go-to market strategy and that\u2019s it? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Sure. Thanks Brian. You are right. I think that the switching products that we have today limit the opportunities to very specific opportunities that we go after, where we know that we can be successful based on the capabilities of our product portfolio. We do have a programmable spine today that\u2019s very useful for certain types of cloud data centers and campus environment, this is EX9200. But that said, if the requirement is more around very dense spine switches than there the product positions that we have is the QFabric. Now, yes, I have alluded to the fact that we are introducing more products in the switching space of this year and certainly I expect that those products are going to help us address a broader set of applications across a broader set of vertical markets, including as I just mentioned in the cloud provider space. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. That is all the time we have this afternoon. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Now, I'll hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015 exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year of your expansion in non-EPS reflects our continued focus in operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives and we remain steadfast in achieving our outlook realizing Juniper\u2019s full potential. Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015. It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in the past few months. We\u2019ve organized our R&D team to innovate as a start-up and unveil the compelling line-up of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today. We\u2019ve been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need and a reception from those that I have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue generating services and a better experience to their customers. I am energized by all the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible. I will now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching, and security in the first quarter. In routing, we are generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline we still see growth opportunities in routing all out. The diversity of our customers across our focus verticals continues to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operators continue to be highlights for us and we are pleased to see solid progress with large enterprise customers such as those in our governments vertical that is opting our routing and SDN solution. Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1 and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest performing IPU routing platform in the market. Three times that of the closest competitor, empowered by Juniper\u2019s new ExpressPlus silicon. Coupled with our NorthStar WAN SDN controller, I am confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp. In switching, we are pleased that our mid-to-high end data center business was strong in the first quarter. So, our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX spine switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with contrail and our partnership with VMware, we are well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network. Moving to security, we know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months illustrating our commitment to offering demand level solutions to have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide and the roadmap was well-received. Just last week, we announced the in-speeds fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth intensive mobile deployment, as well as large cloud data centers. We are getting in front of our customers security challenges and we remain focused on areas where we can win. Service has deserved a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue driven by new service contract and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architectures and with the transition towards service agility and automation. Now to take a step back, the continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for networking innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in the network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking, that's Juniper, that's what we do every day. We are squarely focused on solving our customers\u2019 toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust growth global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace. Our sharpen strategy and focus go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We are executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive comparable profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support. Now I\u2019ll return to over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter. Robyn Denholm : Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin I would like to point out that we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count, while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our Cloud, Cable and European Service Providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015. Additionally, in the quarter we completed a $600 million bond offering enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016. I\u2019d like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategies. The majority of that revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia and in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services. Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the router market, we have direct relationships with our large end-user customers. Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuations, the pricing environment remains competitive and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuations. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of various assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out the network. In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year. Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1 and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. And now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead. Amitabh Passi : Hi guys, I had a question and if possible a quick follow-up. I guess the question Robyn or Rami was just your conviction level and the visibility in the back half of this year in terms of the outlook particularly with U.S. service providers. I also want to just clarify Robyn your comment about second half being better than second half of \u201914. Is that on a quarterly basis i.e. would you expect 3Q \u201915 to be better than 3Q \u201914 and 4Q to be better than 4Q \u201914? And then I have a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Okay. Let me start \u2013 sorry, Amitabh, I think we got the question first. Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half, the really two elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service provider customers including those that are here in Northern America. So we obviously have good visibility into projects that we are working on together. We have as good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that, yes, we are pretty confident in the improvement in spending and a demand in the second half of this year. The second element I think to your question that\u2019s equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals where our engagement with customers are happening on an ongoing basis and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half. And Robyn, I\u2019ll it to you for the rest. Robyn Denholm : Yes, Amitabh, in terms of the commentary what I said was that, we expect the second half of 2015 in aggregate of it is going to be above the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. I am not expecting a different trajectory Q3 to Q4 versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Amitabh Passi : Okay. And then if I can just squeeze a quick follow-up, hey, Rami, just on the new product announcements you had, a few of them in the last three to six months, which one, two, or three would you think would start to add to revenues as we move towards through the rest of 2015 and into 2016. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks, Amitabh. First, I feel really good about the products and the announcements that we just unveiled to the industry. These are obviously technologies that we have been working on very diligently over the last several years and Q1 was honestly very exciting for us business we finally had an opportunity to announce to everybody what it is that we\u2019ve up to. And as you know, they really touch all of our different business areas in switching, routing and security. I have to sort of just remind everybody that, yes, these products all go through their normal certification cycles. We have to first get them out of the market. So right now we are all working around the clock to make sure that we get them into our customers\u2019 hands and ready for deployment, crossing all of the tees and diving the eyes if you will on the testing that needs to happen right now. I expect the first products that hit the market will be the switching products and there I think the ramp will be sooner just based on the availability of that product to that market followed by the enhancements that we\u2019ve made to the PTX product line that happens in the Q3 timeframe. Amitabh Passi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions and a follow-up to the prior question on the new products. So Rami, based on your guidance for both Q2 and the second half, it sounds like they are not really expecting a pause or kind of an half burn effect because of these new products as customers wait for the better products to come out later in the year. Can you just comment on why that is? And then follow-up on specifically the switching part of the portfolio, we haven\u2019t yet seen you announced anything in the area of 25 or 50 gig in the datacenter or 2.5, 5 gig in campus. Can you just comment on whether those are segments that you plan to address. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Sure Simona. Thanks for the question. First, on the overhang effect that you are talking about, we\u2019ve gone through product transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So we obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan, the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I am just going to drill one level deeper. We\u2019ve been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. In fact, with many of our customers, we\u2019ve developed these products with direct input and guidance from them. So it\u2019s not going to be new news for them. Secondarily in the \u2013 let\u2019s say the routing demand with the PTX. Here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we are continuing to invest in this product line and so they know they have the peace of mind if you will that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity require them. On the switching side, I would say the overhang effective slim to none because of the fact that this essentially addresses the gap that exist in our portfolio as opposed to something that replace of the product line that already in the market. On the \u2013 your follow-up question, on 25 gig and some of these newer interface speed, we haven\u2019t gone out externally and talked about specific products. All I\u2019ll say for now is that actually this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers\u2019 requirements are with respect to various different inter phase speeds and we are building that into our roadmap. Simona Jankowski : Great. Thank you, Rami. And then I just had a very quick follow-up for Robyn. Robyn, I heard in your comments on FX having not had a translational impact which makes sense. It was interesting how strong your EMEA business was. Did you not see any impact in terms of either deal size is getting smaller or competitively or in terms of pricing, just from how strong the dollar was? Robyn Denholm : So clearly in the first quarter, we did have very good results in our EMEA business. It was actually up year-over-year. In terms of the pricing impact, it is a competitive market and we continue to take into account the currency impact on our customers budgets, if you like, as opposed to just our own product pricing. And so it is a factor that we\u2019ve dealt within the past and we will continue to deal with it. Obviously, going forward, we factored in what we believe will be the impact from currency into the guidance that I have given you for the second quarter and then also more in terms of the color for the second half of the year as well. Simona Jankowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Rami, first of all, we\u2019re talking a lot about the consolidation in the industry, of course, you\u2019ve mentioned the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent merger. And so, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. First of all, how do you see that affecting you guys? Like, more consolidation in the industry, and I\u2019d say beyond of course the direct impact of Nokia being one of your distributors? And then, so, I would love to hear your thoughts about how you see the industry evolving, going forward? Do you think there could be more consolidation? Do you think you could play in that? And I\u2019m thinking about two things : could Juniper be stronger as a part of a larger entity with service provider clients? And also from a technological perspective, how do you think about you guys potentially being stronger closer to adjacent technologies like wireless and transport versus being independent and focused on IP routing? And then I have a very short follow-up for Robyn. Rami Rahim : Okay, great. Thank you, Pierre. Okay. So, certainly, we see the industry dynamics that are panning out right now. Consolidation is one of those industry dynamics and difficult to predict, but, yes, it could continue going forward. There are other dynamics that are happening as well. There are transformational architectural shifts that are happening right now across the industry, of a movement towards cloud-based service delivery, value delivery to the end users whether that\u2019d be residential or business end uses. And honestly I believe that there is a need for a company that\u2019s going to be really laser focused on developing the types of IP innovation that are necessary to get our customers to make this transition. That\u2019s the role that we play in this company. That\u2019s the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy, our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed in her opening remarks, we have deep direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovation to market. As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past and I still do believe that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic, but with the potential to augment it with some M&A activity. Right now the focus is primarily on getting the products that we\u2019ve announced out the door, but at some point it will probably make sense for us to think about M&A to complement that and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks a lot. And, Robyn, a very, very quick follow-up on the $190 million of business you\u2019ve generated with Nokia last year. How should we think about how sticky the business is? So I understand that you have relationship with client, it\u2019s not completely fully at-risk, but there will be pressure on \u2013 potentially on these numbers. Is that something that can happen in the short-term, or is that more like a longer-term race, because you have like good contractual and like protection related to the fact that it's difficult to swap out technology in a network? Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Pierre. I think that is a good question. I mean from our perspective, obviously, what we control is actually our relationships with our customers, our end-user customers. In terms of the profile of that $190 million for 2014, it was both product and services; it was actually routing, switching, and security, in those numbers. Clearly, there is some overlap in terms of routing with the Alcatel-Lucent portfolio as and when this transaction closes and so that will take some time. So, we believe that there is an opportunity to continue to partner on those areas where we don\u2019t overlap. And then, obviously, the services contracts continue over time with those end-user customers. And the profile of the revenue products versus services is roughly the same as the overall Juniper profile in terms of overall percentage. Pierre Ferragu : Actually, that\u2019s very good. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi. Please go ahead. Ehud Gelblum : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Rami, welcome conference calls, I guess you did one before too, but \u2013 Rami Rahim : Thank you. Ehud Gelblum : Sure. So, a couple of things. First of all, we have mergers in lots of different directions. One obviously is the vendor one, you\u2019re talking about. The other one, given that you are seeing strength in cable is coming from two large cable companies in the U.S. that were on a merger path that may or may not be on a merger path, going forward. Can you give a comment as to how would that impact things positively or negatively, if that merger doesn\u2019t go through? And what kind of like signposts should we be looking for, in terms of what that would mean to your business at EDH1 and just thought process on that? And then, Robyn, a couple years ago, when you had a slew of new products coming out in 2011, I want to say, you gave us this target, I believe it was $75 million \u2013 $75 million or $150 million, I can\u2019t remember. That was about seven quarters out. Is there some kind of signpost that you can give us on growth of these new products that you came out with that are coming out now that we can kind of look to, a couple of like a years or so out, so we can kind of track the progress of the new products? And then I have a very quick \u2013 just a small follow-up. Robyn Denholm : So, Ehud, I will address the second part of the question and then Rami can address the first part around customer consolidation. So in terms of the new product ramps to revenue, obviously, we are very focused on doing that. And Rami went through the number of steps that we need to do in terms of getting the products out and then also having them certified for the networks and that type of thing. We have not put out nor are we going to put out a number in terms of the quantity of revenue to expect. What we would do is give you progress as we incur design wins and that type of thing. But in terms of an overall number, it\u2019s included in our outlook for the second half of the year and it will be modest this year in terms of any revenue impact. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Robyn. On the question regarding cable, first, I will remind everybody that cable is one of our key strategic vertical that we are focusing on and measuring ourselves against in terms of performance of the business. We enjoy a really strong relationship on both sides of the potential merger, you talked about Comcast and Time Warner, and we continue to do so. We\u2019re working very closely with them on the variety of different projects. I personally engage with executives on both sides. So, honestly, whether it happens or not is a very neutral thing for us, it doesn\u2019t change the importance of the vertical for us, it doesn\u2019t change our investment level that we would put into the vertical to make sure that we remain aligned with the innovations that we are introducing into the market. And I will say that some of the new products that we have just talked about were developed with explicit and detailed feedback about the requirements for the cable industry. We know what they want, we know what kind of performance, the capabilities, the feature set that is required to build out their networks, and I feel confident that they are actually going to play out very well for the vertical. Ehud Gelblum : Thanks. So I was just confirming that you actually are on both sides of that, Time Warner and Comcast. Robyn, my question was, on cash flow statement, there is a line, professional services related to non-routine stockholder matters. That was $7.3 million in the year ago quarter and $3 million in this quarter. Is this to deal with your activist investor? And what was the $3 million spent on? Robyn Denholm : So that is actually to do with the settlement that we reached in first quarter in relation to our proxy. Ehud Gelblum : Excellent. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first one is more kind of a longer term. I understand that routing will have cyclical recovery, but if I try to think outside in terms of kind of recovery, in the last four years, routing revenues were flat, 0% growth. What do you think is the outlook? What are the \u2013 even if you don\u2019t get to a specific number, what are the puts and takes for growth over the next four, five years? Why should it accelerate now, if it didn\u2019t grow the last four years, if you take the whole 2011 to 2015? The second question is about the outlook for cost cuts, if at all. So, you\u2019re coming out of the big restructuring program. Is that it from cost cuts point of view? So going forward, will margin enhancement be more of a function of revenue growth, or is there any room for additional cuts? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Let me start, Tal, and then I will pass it over to Robyn. The outlook that we had provided on our routing business over the next three years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that\u2019s achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share, and in order to take market share, you need to have better products. We just introduced a router that has three times the performance of anything else that\u2019s out there in the industry today. At a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we\u2019re capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That\u2019s why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections. And then, as far as the restructuring costs that you\u2019re talking about, let me just start and I will pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is, yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us, but going forward, I think we\u2019re going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We are not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past quite frankly in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything? Robyn Denholm : Yeah, thanks, Rami. I think, firstly, I\u2019m very pleased with the cost performance in the quarter and also the year-over-year declines that we\u2019ve actually achieved this quarter in terms of the cost. I think also just amplifying what Rami said, I mean, clearly, we put out in October that 25% is still our goal in terms of operating margin over this next three-year period. And we are focused on doing that in a balanced way. We want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future of the company, which is obviously the innovation that we are delivering to market. And we will, as Rami said, grow OpEx outside of this year slower than we grow our revenue. And so that\u2019s how we will continue to expand operating margins just like we did in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that is our strategy and we are continuing to do that. So the other side of that tale is that we are always looking for cost improvements, a lot of those will be invisible because you have to actually take cost out to even keep it flat in any sort of environment. So we are very focused on the cost side, but in a very balanced way. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Sue : Thank you. It\u2019s good to see the encouraging commentary. If I look at it from a historical perspective, you went through a period of product pruning. We now know you will keep routing, security, and also switching. As you balance your commentary with OpEx, are there submarkets or perhaps verticals where you might potentially retreat from, while you fortify your efforts into the other verticals of cloud, data center, and service providers? Just trying to get a sense of how you narrow the scope so you get multiplied the effects on the other end. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks, Mark. You know last year was a busy year and a tough year quite frankly because we have to make some difficult decisions about which particular product areas we are going to remain in and which ones we would divest and which ones we would unwind. That work is effectively behind us at this point in time. So I feel very good right now that we are not stretching ourselves too thin, that we are investing in areas and investing sufficiently in the markets that we are playing in in order to differentiate, to compete and to win. It\u2019s that simple. So at this point, the focus really is on the focus in our strategy that we have to grow top line and we\u2019ll go from there. We are in execution mode. Robyn Denholm : Yeah, and if I can just add as well, Mark, you know the work that [indiscernible] go-to-market side is also obviously yielding results and if you look at our strategy more deeply in terms of the vertical focus that we have, it\u2019s obviously clearly focused on those customers that differentiate the network or run their business on the network across cloud, cable, carriers, as well as strategic verticals in enterprise and government. And so we are very pleased with that. And partnering is a key element of making sure that we continue to get the growth rates from a revenue perspective and continue to drive operating margin expansion as well. Mark Sue : That's helpful, Robyn, and on that, as you look at margin improvements and you look at firming net income, how should we think about cash flow from operations, considering the business, when it hums along, generates a lot of cash? Any thoughts on how we should think about cash flow from operations, this year? Robyn Denholm : Yes, I think cash flow generation is a core strength of the business model that we have here at Juniper. I think that operating cash flow in particular does follow the operating margin and the expansion of that will obviously lead to more cash per revenue dollar being generated. And so we are very pleased with our cash flow for the first quarter and even for the whole of last year and that enabled us to continue to drive the investments that we need going forward and also deliver a healthy return for our shareholders in terms of the capital returns that we\u2019ve been committed to. Mark Sue : All very helpful. Thank you, and good luck. Robyn Denholm : Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thanks you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to ask either one of you on the routing cycle, maybe a little bit more short-term question. Which is, you guys seemed to think the routing cycle had bottomed last quarter, is down 15% year-over-year in your numbers. This quarter, you are down 8%, it does kind of feel like that was the right call for you, anyway. Should we anticipate the routing cycle continuing to improve? And, do you think that we're getting to positive year-over-year growth in the second half of your routing? So, that\u2019s the first question I\u2019ve got. And then I\u2019ll just ask a follow-up after you guys answer that one. Rami Rahim : Let me start and I will see if Robyn wants to add anything. I\u2019ll just go back to the commentary we had made. We do expect just based on the two factors that we\u2019ve outlined, service providers spend in general, I mean, I\u2019m talking telco spend in general and, specifically, here in the United States, should improve in the second half of the year and then also the further diversification of our business across the different key verticals that includes cloud, that includes cable. Now based on that, we do anticipate the second half to be better than the first half and also better than the second half of last year. Robyn, anything else? Robyn Denholm : Yes, I agree with obviously everything Ramey said there. I would also point out and I mentioned it in my CFO commentary that we actually had a good routing quarter in Q1 in enterprise as well and that just speaks to not only the diversification of the revenue, but some of the key strategic pivots that we made last year around the data center. So, obviously, in enterprise as well as in cloud data centers in the service provider world there is an element of routing that\u2019s in those solutions as well. And so we are pleased by that performance. We saw some good wins and some good revenue on the enterprise side of routing as well as the SP side. But to confirm, we do expect service provider routing to improve through the year as well. Rod Hall : Okay. And then my follow-up I guess is a strategic question for you, Rami. As you look at the routing business, it looks like, overtime anyway, routing and optical will come closer together. We know there's some organizational reasons at carriers that\u2019s not going to happen as quickly, particularly in some of the bigger carriers, but I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re thinking about prospects of a standalone routing company? How badly do you think you guys need to develop an optical capability, a deeper optical capability, I should say, and do you think it would ever make sense to acquire assets to provide that kind of a capability? Rami Rahim : Yes, Rod, you are absolutely right, there is a transformation that\u2019s happening right now in the industry where the packet world if you will and the optical world that are moving closer together, you are also right about the velocity at which that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s not happening very fast there are all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving fast. As far as our own strategy, we do have a small, but very effective optical team in-house to Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrated them into our routing products, but I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic. It is going to be in software, it is going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that. Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize these pass across layers in a way that is very meaningful to our customers and we are engaging with a number of different customers on these products. It is still early days, early stages, but I\u2019m encouraged by the progress that we are making. Rod Hall : Great. Okay thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert : Hi guys thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the security business and specifically I was hoping to understand if you see any developments that will you believe this business may be nearing a bottom, would you expect the security business to also strengthen through the year and potentially return to growth during the second half and perhaps you can walk through what\u2019s going well and are the keys to better participating what seems to be a fairy vibrant security market? Rami Rahim : Yeah thanks Jeff. So, our goal for this year as I stated last quarter is around stabilizing the security business, if you take a look at our SRX business in Q1, it was more or less flat with Q4. The part of the business that\u2019s in decline and that will continue to be in decline is going to be the legacy ScreenOS business. We\u2019re still in working progress mode if you will on security. I did mention that we pivoted our strategy, we\u2019re not working on a security strategy that\u2019s very highly aligned with the rest of our product portfolio and offering to main level solutions to have a strong security element to our customers and we are executing on a very high leverage engineering strategy. So, just last week in fact we announced the industry\u2019s fastest firewall that\u2019s 2 terabits per second. For cloud operators they are trying to protect massive cloud infrastructure and for mobile operators that are trying to protect the mobile users, their mobile infrastructure that\u2019s very, very meaningful and it\u2019s only possible because of the silicon innovations that we\u2019ve already developed in-house for our other product lines and it just demonstrates the power of the synergies if you will from a cost standpoint that exist in the organization. So, in summary we are focusing on a narrow part of the market. It\u2019s the network security space, tightly aligned with the rest of our products and we believe that we can in fact innovate to differentiate and win there. It\u2019s just going to take a bit of time. Jess Lubert : Rami in the security business over the last couple of years, a lot of your success has been at the high end with large services providers, as services provider spending improved in the back half of the year, should we expect that to also benefit the security business and how are you thinking about security with respect to enterprise, is the recovery likely to be more carrier focused or are you also expecting similar improvement on enterprise? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Well as CapEx improves for services providers I expect that to help all of our business, I don\u2019t know whether specifically for this second half it will have an effect on security. We haven\u2019t broken that out in that way. The enhancements that we are making right now to our Juno Space security products, I want to make clear are certainly very compelling for the service provider space, but it is also compelling for large scale enterprises, so those that are building large enterprise clouds will benefit from the performance and scale that we are adding. And of course it doesn\u2019t stop there, we\u2019re also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space because at the end of the day breaches will always happen, you are always going to be able to overcome any security barrier you put as a parameter, once that happens the key is to prevent the spread of Malware inside of the enterprise and our reversal security products are now being used by enterprises to do exactly that. So, yes our strategy is very much around SP and enterprise. The scale and performance helps both. Certainly more on the SP and the cloud infrastructure space, but also in the enterprise side and finally virtualization is something that will certainly help both SP and enterprise. Robyn Denholm : And just to underscore that I made the comment before about routing and datacenter and the enterprise. The same was true in the quarter for security. The high-end was up again, nothing to write home about yet because it was flat overall. SRX fled overall sequentially. However, the area that did grow nice was actually the datacenter space in the enterprise in this quarter. So, it\u2019s early days, but our overall aim for this year is to create stability in that business this year and then go from there. Jess Lubert : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes thanks. Hi Rami how is it going. A question for you and Robyn. A question for you Rami is, it seems to be like you are doing quite well in the non-telco segments, you know the cloud portals Web 2.0 etcetera that will be helpful for us to get any color on the rough percentage split in terms of revenues like for routing. So, would it be less than 10% for Web 2.0 cloud maybe somewhere in the 10%, 20% and then the remainder would be telco and cable. It would be very helpful. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Hi Vijay. Look we haven\u2019t broken that out. We can consider doing that at point. I will say that the fact that we are seeing strength in cloud and cable and government is not an accident, it\u2019s a deliberate part of our strategy. So, we are in fact listening very closely in making sure that we weave in the requirements from all the customers in these verticals into our products. And I feel good that that\u2019s going to continue. I mean I will tell you again that the products that we have just announced that will be shipped throughout this year were all developed with a deep understanding of specific requirements in these verticals that others that might not have the strategic relationship that they have with these customers would have implemented. So, I expect that that part of the business will continue to do well and certainly the telco side will do well as there is improvement in the CapEx environment there. Robyn Denholm : Yes. I just want to add one more point Vijay. I think the diversification of the revenues, the core strengths of ours and this quarter one of the stats I will leave you with is of that top 10 customers in the quarter, 5 were carriers, 3 were outside of North America. We had four customers in the top 10 that were either cloud or cable and one enterprise customer. So, to me that is - it is really good in terms of the diversification and it is not something that happened over night. That\u2019s been work in progress by the team for quite some time. It speaks to the strength on the go-to-market side as well as the relevance of the products across multiple customer types and so we are pleased that with that progress. Vijay Bhagavath : Excellent. So here is the question for you Robyn that Juniper obviously is engaged in many new initiatives programs, many different types of customers to work with, how would you look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the remainder quarters of the year, you see that trending up as you get into new project from an NFE on the service provider side. The Web 2.0 cloud have their own idiosyncrasies in terms of how they want to work with you, how should we look at OpEx? Thanks. Robyn Denholm : Yes. So, OpEx as we\u2019ve talked about before for this year, for 2015 we have set a goal of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. As we move forward, we said earlier that we\u2019re committed to the 25% operating margin over the next three years. As we grow revenue, OpEx as a percentage of revenue, will start to come down. And so, we\u2019ve talked about that for quite some time. The structural actions that we took last year and the cost areas that we continue to work on are a testament to that. So we are committed to doing that in a balanced way so that we can continue to grow the business over the long term. Vijay Bhagavath : Okay. Thanks. Good luck to you and your team. Robyn Denholm : Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Thanks. Rami, a question on the switching side. Last year in the first half, you did really well in the switching touching $200 million in revenue in the June quarter which historically has been tough to get there. I\u2019m just curious you are tracking about $20 million, $30 million below that number. What\u2019s changed between last year and this year, and what gets you back to that $200 million or north of that? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, sure. Thanks, Sanjiv. On the switching side, let me sort of try to breakout the business and then probably shed some light on some of the observations that you\u2019ve made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side especially as it pertains to cloud has actually performed quite well and that includes performance in the Q1 timeframe, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story which is what you are seeing right now, observing right now in the numbers. Cloud as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud type deployment as well as enterprise IT datacenters has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introduction has helped us grow in that area of the business. On the campus side, you have to understand that we\u2019ve just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business and we pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment if you will for all of growth in switching. Last but not least, clearly we have been competing even in the datacenter without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug if you will with the innovations in the QFX 10K product line that we have just announced and we\u2019ll start to introduce for our customers in the middle of the year. That gives me more confidence again that I think that switching can be a good growth engine for the company going forward. Robyn Denholm : Dany, are you still there? Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go head. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Rami, I want to drill into that switching segment that Sanjiv started. First of all, can you give us a list of qualitative assessment of the breakdown between your datacenter and your campus wiring closet switch just from a revenue breakdown standpoint? Rami Rahim : We don\u2019t break it down but I will say that they both represent pretty meaningful portions of the overall switching business, Ittai. Ittai Kidron : Okay. And then regarding your, the new announcements that you\u2019ve made is very exciting the new switch, but you\u2019ve had a couple of switch cycles in the past and you\u2019ve kind of fumbled on them whether it be the QFabric and even the high end of your modular portfolio, the 9200 and the 8200. They never really managed to catch any traction. It seems like that can modular. You\u2019ve always had very difficult challenges. So what changes in the next cycle? Rami Rahim : Well, I mean at the end of the day these are just words and it\u2019s the numbers that are going to have to prove our thesis if you will of our competitiveness in this space. But all I\u2019ll tell you is that, we have learned tremendously, tremendously from the lessons of introducing the products into the market that are in the market today whether they\u2019d on the EX side or the QFabric side and so forth. And we have taken all of those lessons and applied them over the last couple of years as we were developing these new products into the development of those product lines. And we have now been talking to many of our customers about this product line for quite some time and so far what we\u2019ve heard from them and in fact some of the them had early access to the products and in terms of an ability to actually kick the tyres on them. The feedback has been quite encouraging. Now we have a lot of work to do to finish up testing, ramp up production and get these products into the market. We are doing exactly that right now. But I feel really good about the prospects of this product line. Ittai Kidron : Okay and very good. Lastly, from me, HP announced its acquisition of Aruba, that was your Wi-Fi partner since you\u2019ve exited your Wi-Fi business. Any thoughts on how you plug that hole since you\u2019re trying to plug a lot of holes. Rami Rahim : Yes. Fortunately, I don\u2019t consider this as a hole at least not right now. Now, things could evolve in certain ways but at this point in time, I am very close to the Aruba executive team. I\u2019ve talked to their CEO. That partnership continues. The foundation of that partnership is one that is based on open interfaces between our technology and their technology. So having the ability for our customers to choose battery technology is fundamental. And anybody that lose side of that will lose just because our customers will not accept anything else. And I think that\u2019s the thing that makes this solution a) long lasting, but more importantly or just is importantly it gives our customers the ability to interchange either at Juniper or the Aruba side with different types of technologies. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Ittai. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Brian White : Yeah, Rami, looking at the enterprise market, it was much stronger than seasonal on a sequential basis. In fact it was the best since the first quarter of 2010. So maybe you could walk us through some of the drivers I know Robyn mentioned enterprise routers. But what\u2019s the dynamic in enterprise that it came in so much stronger than seasonality. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks, Brian. Let me start, yes, we are pleased with our enterprise performance at least from a sequential standpoint. There are a couple of dynamics here. First and foremost is from a industry vertical standpoint, the government is actually helping here. We are seeing good strength in some projects that we have with the government agencies and this helps us and switching helps us and routing it also helps us to some extent and security as well. Beyond that, the focus that we have on this transformation that\u2019s happening towards cloud based service delivery is very important. So we are working right now with a large Fortune 500 company and building out their cloud infrastructure around the globe. And that is a testament to the strength that we have in our MetaFabric architecture and the switching product that we\u2019ve introduced into the market. It\u2019s also a beautiful example of how security ties in really effectively to complete the cloud solutions that we offer to our customers. I expect that to continue. Brian White : Okay. And just around the product cycle, when is the bulk of the products hitting the market becoming generally available in the second quarter or third quarter? Thanks. Rami Rahim : It starts in the second quarter but it actually goes throughout the second half of this year. Brian White : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Robyn Denholm : Okay. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and your great questions. Before I close, I just want to give a head up for the Juniper IR and SG&A team that worked out the new format for today\u2019s call. We hope you found it helpful and we love to hear your feedback. Thanks everyone. Talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everybody. We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015. Revenue was stronger than the outlook we provided partially as a result of recognition of differed revenue but also as a result of an overall improvement in demand across several of our key customer verticals. I am particularly pleased with the broad diversity of both bookings and revenue in the quarter. Strong operating margin and EPS reflect our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I am proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished while at the same time mindful that there is still more we can do to achieve our company's full potential. This quarter we unveiled several new products and innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of datacenter switching that converges compute resources, and customizable logic into the network. And ultracompact three terabits per second core router the PTX 1000 that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance. And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their cloud network without slowing them down. Our priority now is on execution as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future. We are investing a next generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers perceive business transformations with profound effects on the cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineer-to-engineer level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation. Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley. One of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company. We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this. Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio and particularly a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series. In Q2 momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural thesis behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high performance IP transport. With the MX customers began adopting our recently introduced line card contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all our recently announced edge products, including the ACX5000 and the virtual MX. We are building on the clear success of our edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solutions with our ongoing execution will continue to drive growth and enable us to take market share. As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2, and furthermore our Northstar WAN SDN controller is in beta trials and is receiving positive field reception. Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments. In switching, we also had a record quarter for the QFX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad based strength in the enterprise, as well as growth for cloud providers and carriers. Customers value our switching innovation in the data center, because it helps them stay ahead of their need for scale and performance, while also providing rich Layer 3 capability, deep network visibility and automation. We expect that our high leverage R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring the innovation to our EX product family over the next year for a mission-critical enterprise campus and branch network. In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth of 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse. Specifically these results were driven by growth in the high end and branch SRX products in cloud data center, mobile carrier and enterprise customer segments. Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize this element of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in security, and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there. Juniper's integrated network security strategy enables us to be a strong provider of secure network, and we remain confident we can win. However, it will take us time as I stated. We continue to see industries trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy. Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation. In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business. I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter. Robyn Denholm : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. For the second quarter of 2015 we delivered strong financial results which reflected strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy. Our results succeed in both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security. The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and feature commitments and a sell-through of channel inventory. Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas, cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas. The improved demand was also reflected in security, which had a growth quarter primarily due to the timing of high end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than one. Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue positively contributed to our results this quarter. Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and a significant reduction in our share count enabled us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. In the quarter we completed $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. There is obviously some uncertainty around the macro environment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe. We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro. Consistent with our view last quarter we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumption. We expect continued diversification of our revenue with cloud and cable customers and improved demand from large US carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers as they continue to build out their networks. You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. I now, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. And thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter as well. So I wanted to start off I guess by asking you about the deferred revenue a little bit and see if you guys could dig into that in just a little more detail, maybe give us some idea of what product categories the deferred revenue was released on. As well as I guess Robyn in the guidance, could you talk a little bit about do you expect another release of deferred revenue next quarter or is that more organic revenue growth that you're guiding for? And I've got a follow-up. Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Rod. I'll answer that question and if Rami has anything to add I'm sure he'll chime in. On the deferred revenue as you know on the balance sheet we have services in product deferred revenue. Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million. Some of which obviously we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance, and some of which we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter\u2019s absolute results that came off the balance sheet. Having said that, we are very, very pleased with the underlying demand and so as you can see our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter, both in terms of product book-to-bill, but also in terms of the overall strength across the routing, switching and security areas and in the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year. So primarily the product deferred revenue in terms of guidance for Q3, obviously we always have projects that we are delivering and new projects that come on to the balance sheet, as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3 we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition. The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2 part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know we record revenue on a sell-through basis. In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter it was actually quite healthy demand in the enterprise space which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks, Robyn. And I - just my follow up. Well, okay. Can I have a follow up or no? Robyn Denholm : Switch over to next question. Rod Hall : Okay. Kathleen Nemeth : No, no. Let's go to next question, and we'll circle back if we have time. Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask you in terms of just the \u2013 performance for the company, now this is the third quarter, would it been raised and that's before you've had the Tier 1 carriers kicking in, in terms of the anticipated improvement in the second half, and also before you test some of the recent product launches kick in as well. So I just wanted to understand a little bit how much of this is a function of the end demand environment versus your own execution versus any other factors you might point to? Rami Rahim : Okay. Great. Thanks for the question Simona. I'll start and I'll see if Robyn has anything to add. Obviously we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw. First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telcos space. So cloud, cable were kite strong for us in Q2, but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, we call a high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere. The other thing that we saw happening in Q2 is just around the diversification across product lines. We saw sequential growth, healthy sequential growth across switching, routing and security. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business. And your question around the second half is essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters, where we expect to see some improvement in telco, but we have not been waiting for that improvement to come ideally. We have been in a mode of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go to market focus to continue to diversify the business and that's what's helping \u2013 and I expect that to continue to help into the second half. As you get even beyond the second half, you know you mentioned the new products. We remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 timeframe. But those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year. And that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exist in the business. Robyn Denholm : Yes. Just to add and Rami said it very well. We are pleased with the results in the quarter. We are also pleased with the previous two quarters as you mentioned. But we're not confused. We are still down year-to-date on a revenue basis year-over-year and there is still a lot of work to do. So the team is focused on doing that, they are delivering. The execution is very good from the team across the board and I've seen Rami talked about some of the underlying trends that we're executing towards. So I think overall we're pleased with the health of the business. Simona Jankowski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. Two questions. First is about the operating margin. 25% this quarter, 25.2% very high, what's the target, what's the next target and how do you think about it next year, how much upside? And again if you cannot give a quantitative guidance, maybe you can just speak about the puts and takes in what drives it up, what drives it down, so we know how to better model this. Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask on a quantitative way or qualitative. And the question is how much of the growth is pent-up demand, meaning customers are waiting for new product for a while and there is concentrated orders in one quarter, two quarters et cetera and after that it normalizes down. And how much of it is more about you finally having something and then the opportunities are wide and big and it opens up new market et cetera? So I'm trying to understand the sustainability of what we are seeing this quarter? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Hey, Tal. This is Rami. So let me start and then I will pass it over to Robyn. On the operating margin, we remain committed to our long-term model that we expressed to you guys in October of last year, which is 25% in a 3 year timeframe. Yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 time frame. I don't expect it to be consistently that in - throughout the 3 year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3 year timeframe remains our long-term model. In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand. There isn't really anything that would suggest it was pent-up demand that all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw as we mentioned in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our key product lines, the MX the PTX the QFX all of which had record products. We've been investing and innovating in all three product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple quarters of this year. And what you're seeing now is the - that execution playing out in terms of strength. So I don't think there is a sort of pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now, that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution on the part of the Juniper team. Robyn Denholm : Yes. I'll just add on the operating margin comment. We are pleased with hitting 25.2% in the quarter. Our view is that it shows the strength of the model. We've been very disciplined on the cost side as Rami indicated. We've obviously taken out structural costs over the last year. We're investing in the right product areas and the team is continuing to do that. But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. If we get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Junos Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly up and a lot of that dropped to the bottom line. The other part of that which I'm sure you've noticed is that we are headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective, which again as Rami mentioned we're committed to doing, and we made very good progress for that this year. So there's a long way to go before we hit what we stated last year in terms of the overall business model, but we're pleased with the progress. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Tal. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead. Amitabh Passi : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Rami you mentioned PTX a few times in the call today. I was just curious is this incremental demand from existing customers, are you seeing your footprint significantly expand? Maybe you should give us some clarity on the demand drivers. And then Robyn, just quickly on OpEx, should we now expect OpEx at the upper end of your $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million for this year. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks, Amitabh. So on the PTX question, I think that it's both. Its what we're seeing is business where we had already been deployed now expanding with some of the newer line cards and capabilities we've introduced into that product line. We're also seeing new or use cases across different verticals, so I will say for example the PTX because of its power efficiency and just the sheer scale has started to become adopted by the cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time. Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it. The announcements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe, that triple the performance and reduce the power even further. And there is a certain segment of our customers that just love that type of capability. And I'll pass it on to Robyn for the OpEx question. Robyn Denholm : Thanks, Rami. So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned in response to the last question about the operating margin. We are very committed to prudent cost management over the future, as we've demonstrated over the last year. Our long-term model is to grow OpEx well within revenue and we've done - we've obviously been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time. We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 in the back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue and we're headed toward the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%. So our view is that the business is strong and healthy as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million at this time last year and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth, then we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx. And so you could say there are certain scenarios where you could see us be slightly above the 19, 25 [ph] but it would be as a result of revenue factors and that would be on variable comp, as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time. Rami Rahim : Let me just emphasize that point. If in fact we do see that we start to get to the top end of our OpEx range or even beyond that it, it will not be because we will take our eye off the ball in terms of OpEx management, it will only because \u2013 it will be because of the variable comp element that's tied to revenue. And at that point, I would just say that the focus should anyways tilt towards profitability and specifically OpEx as a percentage of revenue, which this quarter or in Q2 was below 40%. Amitabh Passi : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Amitabh. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC. Please go ahead. Mark Sue : Thank you. Are we now at the point where we're making significant investment of this is the portfolio, how should we think about the switching side, continued investments there and how should we also think about security. We're seeing a balance after many quarters of declines, and particularly if you can give us a sense of how customers are resonating with a combined solution for both switching and tying that with security, what landscape that continues to live up that would be helpful?. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Sure. Thanks for the question Mark. On the switching side I'm really pleased with the progress that the team has made. From a go-to market standpoint, we continue to see more traction, both in terms of service providers in the enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space without a complete portfolio that includes our spine switches and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us. That's largely now being addressed this year with a new series of QFX spine switches that we will start to introduce. So that I think is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time. Now it takes time for our customers to evaluate test - fully test and certify these new spine switches. But so far the early feedback from our customers is very positive And your question around the portfolio itself that includes switching, routing and securities is actually a very good one, it is in fact a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around cloud architecture as opposed to just switching in a silo. We're doing all of our training around that and it's resonating with our customers, and we've seen, especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from switching and routing in the cloud that can help your overall security posture and also leverage your switching and routing in the cloud to install policies that can prevent the tax from spreading if and when they actually occur. So that portfolio sale is very much part of our strategy and all the sings are that it's actually working quite effectively. Kathleen Nemeth : Great. Thanks Mark. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you, the next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Jess Lubert : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question congratulations on a strong quarter. My question is also for Rami, and I also wanted to dig into the portfolio cell, and specifically this is the first quarter in a long time where we're seeing switching, routing and security, all see very strong sequential results in the same quarter. So, I was hoping you could help us understand to what degree this is due to an uptick in customers buying a portfolio of your products and perhaps you can help us understand the pipeline you're seeing of large multi product deals, the sales efforts here and to what extent you're seeing a competitive advantage from taking a multi product base selling approach? A \u2013 Rami Rahim : Right, I think it's still early days and there is still a lot more potential for us if you will, of leveraging portfolio selling to actually improve the overall results across all the different product line. So that exists today, it existed in the past but what we're doing right now is we're essentially doubling down on the marketing, the collateral, the sales training that will actually in fact help us make this the key differentiator for us. The other thing that we're doing is we're implementing features. So for example, some of the tie in between security, and switching, routing I just mentioned in the answer to the previous question, requires certain capabilities that you actually build into these product lines. There are definitely -- I don't know the exact percentages that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have won both in the enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolio that some combinations of our products. In Q2, strength in switching and in routing is anticipated, I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio in each of those segment. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both enterprise and SP, but I think there could be a little bit of a bumpy ride as I mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustained growth in 2016. Q \u2013 Jess Lubert : Thanks guys. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Jess. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Brian White : Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you could just update us on what you're seeing right now in terms of appetite for NFE and SDN solutions here, and how you're thinking about it going into the next year? Thanks. A \u2013 Rami Rahim : Sure Brian, it's definitely part of pretty much every strategic discussion that we have with any one of our -- especially service provider customers, in some cases also in the enterprise base, but mostly on the service provider side. Right now it's very much an architectural discussion of what's needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or PoPs as to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next generation services using NFV. For us what it means is, first you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. It's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud, and we're doing just that. So we just recognized our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 time frame, and the virtual SRX is also a really great example of taking what is a physical product and take and using or leveraging all of the great functionality but repurposing to virtual machines sitting on generic server. Those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together you need to have automation and orchestration and the management to help our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end users. And this where product like Contrail comes in, and most service providers that we're seeing are gravitating toward an OpenStack based orchestration solution, our goal for Contrail is simple, to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack. And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers but also through surveys. for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum just a few weeks ago suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal. So it's still early days in summer, but I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing, and the go to market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space. Brian White : That was good, thank you. Operator : Thank you, the next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Thanks, just one clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Robyn remind us if you've disclosed exposure to the cloud vertical as to percentage of revenues coming from there. And then Rami, a question for you, wondering how much of the underlying demand in the telco vertical, whether it's happened or it's coming is from 10 to 100 gig upgrades, and if that's happening, where we are in that cycle, in that upgrade cycle? Thanks. Robyn Denholm : So, thanks Sanjiv. In terms of the percentage of revenue, we haven't put out the overall mix in terms of percentage of revenue since Q3 of last year. We will look to possibly do that in the next period of time. Having said that, what I will share with you, like I did last quarter is the number of customers and our top 10 customers in the quarter. So for Q2, our top 10 customers, four were telco, two were in the U.S. and two were not in the U.S. Five were cloud and cable customers, and one was the large enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was one more telco customer and one less cloud and cable customer in the top 10. What I will also say is you know this underlying same as diversification is absolutely real in terms of that number of customers that we have in each one of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S. but also international. The regional carriers as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today or in my commentary, were actually good for us in the U.S. in the second quarter. And so the diversification is they are across all of the different verticals as well as within the vertical how many customers we're serving, and then also the third element of geographic diversification. A \u2013 Rami Rahim : And Sanjiv, on your question around 10 to 100 gig migration and that helping with momentum in the telco space. I think that has actually, largely started in certain network layers of the service provider space a while back in the wide area network, and the metro networks and we certainly benefited from that to some extent.  But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use cases and applications. Cloud providers for example, loved the fact that our security portfolio, the high end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network and when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall, that we're the only game in town. Really, so that's the use cases have actually became a very good use case for us. And then certainly there is a migration that's happening in the core of the datacenter as well that we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SP space and the cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Got it, thank you, helpful. Robyn Denholm : Thanks Sanjiv. Operator : Thank you, the next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask two questions, first Rami, I think you've mentioned a couple of times that or always that there were record product revenues at least in some of the product families. Just if you could elaborate and clarify that, and then Robyn, you may have mentioned this but I apologize if I missed it, but just wondering if you could give a little insight as to what's happening in Asia and kind of the reason that geography seemed under perform a little bit some of the others and how you're thinking about that going into the second half of the year, I think you've said you tried to model that conservatively but just a little bit more color there would be helpful thank you? A \u2013 Rami Rahim : Okay, thanks James. Let me start on the record product question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn to comment on the Asia question. Yes, so we did say and that is a fact that three of our product lines our flagship product, The MX, the PTX, QFX, all has record revenue quarters in the Q2 time frame Robyn Denholm : [indiscernible] services by the way. A \u2013 Rami Rahim : Thanks for the reminder, and each for a different reason. The MX has always been a very successful product, and we continue to invest in that platform to keep ahead of the demand for capacity, but also the demand for services. The thesis pieces behind the MX was all around conversions, is around simplifying your edge architecture by deploying a single platform that can deliver all services. I think we were pioneers in articulating that thesis and executing that strategy, and we've benefited from that, and we've introduced new line in card, new capabilities to actually make this more of a reality and we certainly saw the results in Q2. PTX, this is a product line that we knew when we initially shipped it would require a bit of a different mindset around how to develop and build out a next generation core architecture, we called it the super core. And this requires a bit of a different approach to how one might in fact architect a wide area core, or a wide are metro network. And quite frankly it took us a bit a time, took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture, and I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happened and we are starting to see faster growth from the PTX, that proves that the pieces that we had made initially was the right one. QFX, this is -- first again, we continue to add new capabilities to our QFX topper bracts, which is in our access switches, but we're also just from a go to market stand point, been focusing quite heavily on our datacenter opportunities, our cloud opportunities, and that's where the growth in the market is and that's where the differentiation that we have in the QFX in terms of things like the layer 3 capabilities, really start to become very effective and the results are that we saw a great quarter for the QFX. Robyn Denholm : So, let me talk about APAC, and Rami can chime in as. So APAC, we did have a disappointing quarter there. The revenues were down 10% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. We were anticipating a softness in China. And in my outlook I mentioned that I expect that to continue. Some of it is obviously geopolitical and also competitive factors in China. If we excluded China, actually the revenues would have been up for the rest of the APAC, 11% sequentially. So, we've talked previously about -- obviously about different regions within Asia Pacific, we're seeing good design wins and growth in the Asian countries, Malaysia, and Singapore, obviously Indonesia, we have seen some good wins in India. Although that market, we're continuing to increase our capabilities in. In terms of the New Zealand operations in Q2, had a good quarter. Japan was slightly soft but actually not bad overall and the -- Korea was slightly negative as well. But 10 to go more inline with service providers deployment just given the concentration that we have in those market around service provider. So our view is, in terms of the region we're making progress in a lot of different areas. China was weak in the quarter and we expected to be weak as we move forward. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Thanks, James. Next question? Operator : Yes. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. And congrats on a good quarter. I had a couple questions for you Robyn. First on the deferred revenue, again going back to that. I understand that revenue came off the deferred into the revenue. But why is it that you\u2019re long-term deferred is the one part that\u2019s actually been declining on a year-over-year basis for three quarters in a row into high teens, what does that mean, what's going on there. And the second question goes back to the question Tal asked before, you've effectively touched on your long-term target right now, are you now at a mode where you are hiring, you are net hiring on a year-over-year basis. Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot, meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have that you need to ramp. I understand that your long-term you wanted to clearly drive revenue faster than OpEx. But is there a three fourth quarter period where is there a little bit of a catch-up, if you've gone a little bit too far maybe? Robyn Denholm : So let me talk about deferred revenue. So, long-term deferred revenue is primarily services. So we do service contract renewals on a one year and a three year basis. And depending on the customer, depending on whether they a renew on a one year or three-year basis. And so the declines that you've seen are in the long-term are specifically to do with the proportion of three year versus one year at any point in time. So obviously three year customers it will come down before they renew again for three years. And so that's what you've been seeing fleet off on the long-term. There isn't anything more than that in the long-term deferred revenue. And so when those renew you will see that long-term actually increase again. In terms of hiring, I put the headcount numbers in my actual commentary. So we ended this quarter at 8,815 head [ph] modestly up from the prior quarter. The team is being very focused on how we actually continue to invest in the things that matter, around the product portfolio and that type of thing. I'm not expecting a catch-up in terms of headcount or significant increase in headcount. We're managing things very well and quite honestly the teams are very productive, the way we are. Rami Rahim : Yes. The only thing I'll add is, we have what we need in the plan that we're working towards this year to invest in all the areas of innovation that we know we need to invest in for the - our long-term competitiveness in the spaces that we're in. Robyn Denholm : Yes. That was something very conscious that we did \u2013 at this time of taking out the structural cost. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Thanks, Ittai. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha : Thanks. Maybe a question for Rami. By basic question is, given all the products and the success you are seeing across various different verticals. Do you think by the end of this year that Juniper will be in a stage where will be sufficiently diversified you wouldn't have years of touch on longer periods of revenue declines, you would have diversify, especially away from service provider cycle or that require a little bit longer of trying to understand the timing of it? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Kulbinder. I think this - the strategy that we're on and the focus across the key vertical segments, cloud, cable, telco's, financial services, government, is one that I think has a lot of list. I mean, the opportunity for us in cable for example or in cloud appears to be very good and sustainable. I know for example, let me just tick on one vertical in the cloud space where we are very, very close to them in terms of the architectural evolution of their network today, but also in the future and also in terms of the capabilities, the features, the performance, the scalability that we are implementing into our new products that will be released over the coming year and beyond. It's just a function of our strategy and I think that it's something that can actually play out for a long period of time. Very difficult to put a time period on it, but it is not something that I see as an immediate or short term end to. Kulbinder Garcha : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, great. Thanks, Kulbinder. We'll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, thanks. Yes, congratulations Rami to new team, solid results. Quick question if I may, is on the Web 2.0 cloud customer segment, more recently we have been hearing Arista and perhaps Cisco starting to leverage new merchant silicon for routing, in particular data center routing which could soon scale up into the core telco network? So like to get your understanding of the competitive dynamics that you see from your point of view from a pricing point of view mainly and also from a feature performance point of view competing with these news merchant silicon Layer 3 switch routers versus what you have currently in your portfolio with MX and PTX? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Sure, Vijay. So clearly \u2013 first let me just say this. We use both merchant and also our own silicon across the variety of products in switching and routing and in security. We are absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon and to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible. And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is in fact something that\u2019s going to differentiate us and therefore pay off because these chip projects as you know are not inexpensive projects, and we've done exactly that. If you look at the cloud space for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity. As you get into the core the need for power efficiency programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes theirs. And so that's what we've - essentially what we have done. In the competitive environment, we understand. I mean, this is a competitive space and both from the standpoint of systems vendors that are using merchant or their own silicon and also from the standpoint of merchant silicon technology that's out there. And as long as we are innovating and focusing on the parts of the market where we know that we can achieve differentiation then that's what we will do, we'll choose the best tools and technologies for the right areas of the network. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Thanks, Vijay. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Subu Subramanian of Hinduja Group [ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Rami, my question was around visibility around the Tier1 carrier improvement that you've been mentioning and expecting for second half. Obviously September quarter guidance is a little bit more flat quarter-over-quarter, are you expecting towards fourth quarter more normal seasonality and is that when we should start seeing the US Tier 1 carriers improved. Could you talk about the outlook for the US Tier 1 carriers? Robyn Denholm : Subu, let me just make sure I correct something that I hope people understand that the guidance for Q3 and then I'll hand it over to Rami on the visibility question. So you mentioned the word flat Q3 to Q2. Actually it's up. So the way I want you to think about it is, if you take out of Q2 results, the deferred revenue impact it's on all of the $48 million, a large portion of that and then you actually look at that versus the guidance. What you'll see is that we are actually projecting an increase quarter-over-quarter in the underlying business. More consistent actually with what we've seen historically when we've had growth years in terms of Q3 over Q2. So with that I'll hand it to Rami to talk about the visibility. Rami Rahim : Sure. First, I just want to emphasize the fact that, while the telco space remains a very important vertical for us, we are by no means tied completely to that space in terms of what drives our business. The diversification across the vertical and across products is certainly helping us in dampening if you will some of the effects of the lumpiness in that space. As far as the second half, it really is consistent with what we have been saying over the last several quarters. We expect to see some improvement, but that's going to be complemented with continued diversity. That's going to help us achieve the results that we're expecting for the second half. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions. So next question operator? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. I appreciate you taking my question. First off just housekeeping, were there any 10% customers? Secondly, if you already said it, I apologize, but what was the \u2013 what pricing environment are seeing both on the service, prior to routing side, as well in enterprise switching. And then question I have listened and I've heard your comments here in terms of the diversification of the business. But I'm just wondering to what extent is the strength you are seeing now in you expect in the future, to what extent is that project driven and competitive dynamics, were you having greater success with the new platforms et cetera? And to what extent are you seeing an improvement in demand. Obviously there is been quite a number of data points about enterprise weakness from others throughout the IT spectrum. And again I'm wondering to what extent is this in demand versus the project? Thank you. Robyn Denholm : Okay. Paul, I'll handle the first couple of questions and then Rami can chime in. So in terms of 10% customers there weren't no 10% customers in the quarter. What was the second question\u2026 Rami Rahim : Pricing. Robyn Denholm : Pricing. So in terms of the pricing environment, obviously it's a consistently competitive environment globally. But as you saw from the gross margins we had pretty healthy product gross margins, which reflects not only the ongoing competitiveness of the portfolio, but also the cost reductions that we continue to focus on in the supply chain. So from our perspective no discernible difference in the competitive dynamics in the quarter. Rami Rahim : On the question around market versus projects and I am assuming you are really asking about whether something specific to Juniper in the projects we're engaging and versus something that's more broader. It really depends and in some cases it\u2019s very difficult for us to tell really. But in the cloud space for example in our switching, what you are seeing there is more of the market opportunity shifting towards the data center. So we ourselves as a company are diverting more of our intentions, especially on the go to market side, on the support side to that opportunity and benefiting from the growth in that market segment. I think in other verticals, like maybe in the cloud space it actually could be more project driven. It could be more of a market share phenomenon that's happening because we have traditionally been really strong and very close to that vertical and something that's paying off for us. So it's a mix and difficult to really break out in any precise detail. Robyn Denholm : And Paul, I just want to make sure the telco customers are important customers to us as well. We're not saying that we are diversifying away from the customers. They are important. They will continue to be important. Having said that, the innovation that we're delivering is as relevant to other parts of the market and through the changes that Rami mentioned in terms of not just the portfolio, but also the go to market notion. We're actually driving revenue growth through those other verticals as well. So I think that's a very important point. And I think earlier in the questions there was the comment around cyclicality. There's no question one of the reasons why we decided to work on the go to market muscle in terms of some of these other verticals was exactly to that reason to offset some of that cyclicality as we move forward. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Paul. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Fantastic. Great. Robyn Denholm : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Kvaal : Hi, everyone. Thank you. I think one of the things that you folks have hit on in some of your commentary about the routing market is the blurring of the line between the core and the edge. Can you help us understand in a little bit more detail about what that means for you, I think at a high level one might say okay great, you can use your strengths in the quarter to improve your share in the edge. But then conversely one might wonder if Alcatel [ph] act, which has some presence in the edge may have a broader addressable market for them for example? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question Jeff. I guess the diversity what it means or sorry the blurring what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products we develop them in such a way that we becomes somewhat agnostic as to where in fact they will be placed to deal with the massive amount of IP transport traffic. In some areas in might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network, in some areas it might be more of a metro network. What's happening today architecturally is data centers in some cases are being built in more distributed locations, which puts more pressure in the metro areas and in some cases then more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case then we win either way and that's exactly the goal. So take for example our PTX product line. It comes in a large and medium and now with the PTX1000 a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we are building these products and the capabilities of these products to address interest the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to sell. It makes more difficult for us to break out, our numbers into core and edge we can sort of estimate it. But I sort of tend to measure ourselves now as more as routing all up in the wide area network as opposed to specific to core edge. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Would that be misstating to you to say it becomes easier for you to sell the architectural play and therefore you think it's an advantage relative to some people who traditionally have been stronger just in one or the other? Rami Rahim : I would agree with that. Yes. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. All right. Okay, good. Thank you all very much. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Jeff. Thank you everyone. This will conclude our call for today. Thank you as always for your great questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Kathleen. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metrics and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continues to yield positive results with revenue booked sequentially and year-over-year across routing switching and security. Notably, this quarter we saw strong performance within our telecom and targeted enterprise vertical. Security was also a highlight with double-digit growth driven by our high-end SRX products. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business. The industry is in rapid transition, moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this era of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure play in high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening, and our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution. We continue to lead the industry with technology innovation. In the quarter, we know announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Networks Unite for the cloud-enabled enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the enterprise campus and branch segment, and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric, which enables customers to simplify management of large enterprise campus network. We also announced new security innovation that will enable sophisticated threat intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. We are forging new alliances and partnerships that will help us drive top-line growth and market expansion. In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NEC to help provide IP transport routers to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology alliance ecosystem, adding Aerohive network, who will along with Ruckus and Aruba will help us deliver a simple secured and cloud managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises. Because of our clear focus on execution we are seeing some great customer product traction. Among our top customers in the quarter, our globally recognized high-tech company, and four of our top 10 are cloud or cable provider. Has our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper\u2019s unique value proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance agility and automation and we are empowering such companies as British Airways and Telef\u00f3nica Spain to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise. In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading-edge technology companies. I\u2019ll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technologies. First, I want to underscore how strategic our Contrail solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open-source products, software-driven automation and containers and micro services. We secured each headwinds in three major segments, Software as a Service, Public Cloud, and Telco Cloud and FBE. Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter. In routing we grew 13% year-over-year. Most verticals continued to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We had another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products the PTX5000, PTX1000, ATX500 accelerated. In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX series. The QFX10000 continued to see good traction along with the QFX5100 with service providers, cloud and enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the EX family switches with enterprise, government and service provider customer. In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with cloud and service provider customers. And branch SRX is doing low in government and managed service provider and enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst spurring our return to growth. The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated. By remaining resolute in our focus as a pure play in high-performance networking we are creating tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders. Overall, while we acknowledged that recent industry consolidation activity could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remains healthy. Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected and our Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macroeconomic landscape. The world needs a company like Juniper networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge the status quo and deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders, who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize Juniper\u2019s full potential. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Robyn to review a few highlights of the quarter. Robyn Denholm : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC, as well as solid growth in the enterprise across all geography. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers. However, as we have noted this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployment. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and feature commitments. In reviewing our top 10 customers, five were telcos, three which were outside of the U.S., four were cloud and cable providers, and one was an enterprise customer. We expected diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with the year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product book-to-bill greater than one. For the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue. In the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our accrued operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million, as we focused on investments to drive long term productivity and support continued innovation and developments of new products. We repurchased $50 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividend. Through Q1 of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenue to continue. We expect continued uncertainty around the macro-environment in China and certain parts of Europe which we have factored into our outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. I\u2019m very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline, including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers, given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunities from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters, while remaining in line with our long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%. You can find the detailed outlook to Q4 in the CFO commentary available on our website. To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to achieve our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target verticals and geography. We continue to see good traction with our customers, brand-new product innovations, as evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline. As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. And now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team there at Juniper. A quick question, you mentioned about investing more for the future but still within your financial goals which is great. For the investing in those items can you help us a little bit more, is that focused on say geographic expansion or product expansion or certain areas like software security or certain parts that you\u2019re little softer? And also the timing of when these harvesting of these investments should start to see some growth where we should start to see some fruit from that investment? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question and the comments, Jim. Let me just start and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. First and foremost, as a pure-play innovator, the goal for Juniper is really to continue to make sure that we have really differentiated products in the market segments that we are going after. We have incredible product pipeline as we talked about earlier this year and it\u2019s now in the process of shipping. And we\u2019ve also consistently said that when we invest we\u2019re going to invest in a way, in a prudent manner with discipline that\u2019s commensurate with the growth of the company. That\u2019s a discipline that Robyn and I are absolutely driving through organization right now. It\u2019s one that I think is paying off. If you just take a look at the profitability metrics in terms of operating margin and OpEx as a percentage of total revenue for the company in Q3 timeframe. And I\u2019ll pass it Robyn if you want to add anything else. Robyn Denholm : Yes, so specifically, Jim, what I mentioned in my commentary was that we will invest modestly as we move forward here on the go-to-market side. And Rami mentioned from a product delivery point of view, we\u2019re very excited about the new products that we are delivering in to the market. We\u2019ve seen good receptivity to those products. And so we\u2019re adding prudently to the go-to-market and that to make sure that we are capturing the opportunity that\u2019s out there. Jim Suva : Thank you, and congratulations again to you and your team. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, just first a follow-up to the previous question. Does it mean - so you\u2019re now at an operating margin of about 25% give or take. What does it mean from a margin target that the fact you want to invest more? What does it mean for the margin target going forward? That\u2019s number one. Number two, I want to ask more about the market itself. There was a routing cycle. You recovered from some weakness we had in previous quarters. How is - what\u2019s the outlook? Was there just a recovery from the lows? And then there is a new level and from there it goes flat, because I see it was flat sequentially this quarter. Or do you see demand, continue to creep up, go up, because of certain reasons, you can identify the reasons? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks, Tal. So let me start, then I\u2019ll also hand it over to Robyn. On the margin target, I think the results that you saw in Q3 with respect to our operating margins being north of 25% and also again, our OpEx as a percentage of revenue being in line with our long term model. The long term model that we outlined to our shareholders at the end of 2014 is intact. And the results of that you see here should eventually give you confidence and it gives us a lot of confidence that we can absolutely achieve that long-term model. That\u2019s how I would think about it. And certainly that requires a level of disciplined execution and investment that are driving through in the company today that I\u2019m honestly quite proud of how the team is executing on. On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we\u2019re seeing in routing in the second-half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We said that there should be some improvement in telco spending in the second-half of the year. And that\u2019s essentially happening. We did see that improvement, not only in the tier 1, but also in non-tier 1 service provider. Booking for routing, it was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially is the result of cloud, difficult compared relative Q2 because of the revenue recognition to book that we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn? Robyn Denholm : Yes, I know, I think you said it well on the margin side. In terms of the percentage of revenue for OpEx we are targeting 39% of which we outlined last year and I will point out that whilst we got to the model this quarter we did get the last quarter as well from an operating margin perspective. There is still a lot of work to be done to get there on a sustainable basis and an annualized basis. So I think we\u2019ll have the next question. Manny, can you\u2026 Operator : Excuse me. Yes, the next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thanks very much. Rami, you commented on the recent industry consolidation, but then you also made a comment that the world needs a company like Juniper. I was just curious, was that a reference to a preference you have to remain standalone versus participating in the consolidation? And then, I have a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the question, Simona. You look at the industry right now, certainly, there are examples of consolidation, there is at least one example where the exact opposite of a split is in fact happening. But these things that I want everybody to be aware of is the massive transformation that\u2019s just happening in terms of technology, in terms a new approach in that service providers and enterprises are using to deliver value to their end user, that requires things like virtualization, requires things like automation and visibility and analytics. And that in my mind requires that there would be somebody that\u2019s absolutely focused on innovation in the space of IP networking. And I believe that\u2019s the role that we satisfy in this industry, as I go around the world and I talk to our customer CIO, CTO, CEO they all have the common theme in terms of requirements, which is a technology provider that can partner with them to offer a new way for them to deliver services and values to their end users. And they view us as that right partner that\u2019s I think the role that we satisfy. Simona Jankowski : Thank you. And then just a follow-up question which is to with your MX product, which has been very successful over the years. Some of your competitors physical there has been others are talking about addressing some of the routing features in the routing stack, and then aggregated fashion on the switching platforms in the data center. And I think you guys are considering or working on doing something similar, but can you just address how that developments are might impinge on the opportunity for the MX and whether that\u2019s kind of holistic whether you do it to yourselves or others do it to you? Rami Rahim : Sure. Thanks for the question Simona. So, the MX success is a result of a few different things that one of the biggest elements of the success has to do with the diversity of used cases that is satisfied, it really has turned into the standard Swiss Army knife, if you will, for this industry or has the ability to deliver all sorts of services whether it be business or residential or to serve at the edge of the data center connecting data centers together or connecting data centers to the consumer of cloud services. I think it\u2019s very difficult for anybody to target the MX it is entirety with all of the used cases that it serves the flexibility that we built round up from the start to make it very competitive. Now, let\u2019s said, I\u2019m not confused about the fact that this industry is a competitive industry and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there will be competition that will go after specific used cases that the MX does target. And in that case we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of the MX in solving that used case in a better way or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it would be the PTX or the new QFX10000, that can solve in particular used case in a more efficient manner. So, I think about it from a standpoint of, yes, the industry is competitive. We now have a diverse future between the MX, the PTX and the QFX that give us all of the weapons that we need to compete effectively. Simona Jankowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan, please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on switching the numbers better than we expected momentum that continues yet, what are other data points out there pointing to enterprise in many regions. I just wonder Rob, could you just comment on where we are with the major projects that you guys are seeing and switching or implementing and have you added more of those projects that was allowing it\u2019s about trend and then I got a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Sure Rod. In switching I think the strength was broad-based and there we saw a good diversity of business across both the service provider and the enterprise. We also saw healthy demands for switching around the world which certainly help. And when you think about switching, for us it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistency across pretty much all of our market verticals. In the enterprise, there is a Cloud-First Mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workloads and applications to the clouds and the service provider segment and the cable provider segment they are looking at delivering more value to end users through cloud-based architectures. I think our switching, routing and security portfolios are coming together under the mega fabric architecture framework in a way that\u2019s really resonating with our customers. And the roadmap with the new set of spine switches that were in the process of shipping into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers. I think I\u2019m bullish on the long-term prospects we\u2019re switching given, all of these trends and because of the differentiation that we have in our product portfolio. Robyn Denholm : You had a follow-up Rod? Hi Manny, or Rod are you there? Operator : Yes. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Robyn Denholm : . : , : Pierre Ferragu : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I would want to ask many questions, you\u2019ve been doing so great on so many dimensions. So, maybe I would just restricted to switching and security. In switching, because to know if how like the ramp up of your product to high density spine QFX switch is doing and how much it has an impact in numbers this quarter. And if we should expect some website from this product trend, but only one or two quarter horizon. And then on the security so impressive to see SRX platform doing so well at the moment. And it would be curious to know, where are you winning with the platform at the moment and how are you replacing like nagging, in the broad-based that you had out there, so is that the product cycle are you winning this, are you displacing competitors that would be very good to know that. And then, almost everybody asked you that. I can\u2019t helping us one more question on, how we should think about that going forward. Would that be fair to think that you guys whatever - whichever we think it\u2019s happened going forward, I probably not going to grow your cost basedin the OpEx based on your revenues, is that the fair statement. And sorry for the embarrassing question. Robyn Denholm : That\u2019s okay. Yes. Let me handle the last one first, and then Rami will talk about switching and security. So, on the cost side absolutely we are focused on the discipline around cost management that we\u2019ve shine over the last few years. And we are very focusedon making sure that we only add modest amount of costs. The increase between Q3 and Q4 again to meet point of 500 plus or minus in terms of OpEx. The majority of that increase quarter-over-quarter the vast majority is actually variable cost. So, what we\u2019re talking about is modest increase as we now go to market we\u2019re very focused on delivering the leverage in the model as we believe is there in lying with our long-term model. Robyn Denholm : This is great, thanks. Pierre Ferragu : Thank you. Rami Rahim : And, hi, Pierre. Let me touch on switching and security. So, in the spine switches we\u2019ve now shift the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches, we anticipate that we\u2019ll get the second version now into our customers hand before the end of the year. The traction that we\u2019re seeing is solid, I think that these products have been now in our customers lapse for some time and we\u2019re getting feedbacks and we are eventually putting to finishing touches on those products. I will say that the team really pushed the limits of technology developing these products and we did with the hope and the anticipation that we will have some two differentiation and it\u2019s playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to net sales in the market and I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently set the modest revenue in the second-half of this year and that\u2019s how I would think about it with the growth really starting to happen next year. On the security side, if you recall earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot, we talked about reaching synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost as well as revenue, we talked about switch and security is being instrumentally tight to the network. And the initial focus for us was on the high-end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have the peace of mind that it will be resilient, it will be high quality, it will be resilient to attached from that guide. And that means that you should be able to secure the network, with that\u2019s flowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high-end I think we\u2019ve increased the confidence in the eyes of our customers, we\u2019ve improved the performance of the product lines dramatically it\u2019s now effect the high endis directed the fastest firewallin the industry. And so for certain used cases around the edge of the cloud in service provider and mobile infrastructure. We really have to differentiate the products and we\u2019re starting to see the effect of that. That said, I am not yet calling machine accomplished on security, we\u2019ve said that 2015 will be in the year of stability and we\u2019ve still a lot of work quite frankly for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio especially if it comes to the enterprise and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on right now. So, pleased with what we\u2019ve done so far a lot more work for us to do. Robyn Denholm : .: Pierre Ferragu : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. With that, we\u2019ll turn to Rod Hall for his follow-up question. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for coming back to me. Can you hear me okay? Rami Rahim : Yes. Robyn Denholm : Yes. Go ahead. Rod Hall : So, If I\u2019m just going to ask about the routing business and one of you guys can comment on what you think happened to your share this quarter in market share and also on the Contrail, on AT&T which by the way congratulations on that. I just wonder if you could maybe give us a little idea what the revenue opportunity that might look like what sorts of products that might pull through, thanks. Rami Rahim : Sure, Rod. On market share I don\u2019t think all of the reports are collect, yet, but these share reports you have to look at them and dissect them into different areas. I think in the edge based on the wins and the project that we\u2019ve been executing on there is a large dynamic that\u2019s happening around the world especially here in the US and in EMEA for edge modernization and consolidation simplification of edge architectures. And just based on the project activity I believe that we\u2019re doing quite well. In the core, I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for us as we go through the transition from T Series to the next generation of the PTX that we\u2019re shipping this year that we\u2019ve lost in the early part of this year. So, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen there with respect to our share, but I feel good about the roadmap and the focus in terms of the prospects for share gains going forward into next year. On Contrail yes you pointed out one of the wins that we are very proud of and that is with AT&T, but let me say that pretty much every strategic discussion that we\u2019re having with our customers around the world especially on the service provider side, but also in some larger enterprises that are looking at transforming the way in which they manage their networks to simplify the operations of those networks and to add far greater agility in how they deliver services over those networks. They are thinking about a new architectural approach and Contrail is part of that discussion. So, we added four new paying customers, I think the engagements have expanded the developer community for the open source Contrail project is only growing the amount of innovation that\u2019s not coming not just from Juniper, but from our partners around the industry is also growing, I\u2019m really proud of what the Contrail team has done and continuous to do. And AT&T certainly who extremely created that project, but I think that\u2019s just an example of others that were also engaging in. Rod Hall : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Jess Lubert : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another nice quarter here. First, I would hope you could tell us of getting 10% customers in the period and if so what category they would fall into. And then secondly, in Europe of course like your Carrier business is fairly strong so, it\u2019s helping to understand that was driven by a handful of large deals that would tail-off after a quarter or two, where that was driven by a larger number of transactions that might be more sustainable and then perhaps you could provide an update on the Nokia partnership how that\u2019s proceeding, how confident you are in your ability to navigate any disruption once that deal is closed? Thanks. Robyn Denholm : Yes. So, Jess, in terms of 10% customers there were no 10% customers in the quarter. Again, part of the strength of this quarter was actually the diversification of revenue in the quarter again with enterprise actually being quite strong, telco being quite strong, and obviously, a sequential decline but still very healthy year-over-year growth in the cloud providers and cable area. So, I\u2019ll let Rami talk through the EMEA service provider business. Rami Rahim : Sure. So, in Europe actually the strength was fairly broad-based, it was with both on the service provider, the key or the tier 1 telecom operators, but also in the enterprises and particularly government. So, actually I\u2019m pretty pleased with the broad-based strength of the business, there are certainly large deals in the SP space. There are typically going to be large deals that drive the overall performance, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s atypical if you will in the quarter. And then I will say that the project that we\u2019re engaging in are really around a number of key used cases edge modernization in particular such as for example the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain seems to be a really key scene in that region, I think operators are looking to streamline their networks and deliver more value with great agility over this networks and for that you need a universal edge type product and the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we\u2019re executing towards strategy and the plan that we outlined in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed deep relationship with all of our customers around the world and where there is a need to make a change in our total market approach we\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re doing it to a schedule that I think is working very well for us, so no concerns on that forefront. Jess Lubert : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead. Brian White : Yes, Rami. I wonder if you could comment a little about this product cycle we\u2019re ramping up this year, but if you had to provide us with an idea where we are in the revenue generation from this product cycle that would be great in terms of what percentage we are the way through and just the AT&T win for the carriers often define networking maybe just a little more color on why Juniper was chosen and does this categorize existing business or net-net this is incremental for Juniper? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks Brian. On the product cycle and I\u2019m assuming here you\u2019re talking about the newer product that we\u2019re introducing market across routing, switching and security it\u2019s still early stages we\u2019re consistently in that second-half, we\u2019ll see modest revenue on the routing side, we haven\u2019t yet shift the enhancements to the PTX product lines we\u2019re very excited about. I think the growth really started to happen in a meaningful way in 2016 and the early customer interest gave us confidence of these products of hitting the mark in terms of the challenges that they solve for our customers. On AT&T a couple of different projects that have been announced one, is that we are participating in AT&T network on demand initiative. We\u2019re doing this especially we\u2019re offering, we\u2019re partnering with them to offer to end users, enterprises. And you weigh the rising value from their networks that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So, they will have the ability to choose on-demand the kinds of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them and it\u2019s a very soft or eccentric approach to market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity. And we want it quite frankly because we have challenged the ways in which these solutions were delivered historically. We had actually little to nothing to lose, because it\u2019s essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so, we\u2019ve demonstrated to AT&T that we are a very willing partnered in that technology transformation and we\u2019re delighted that we were successful. And the second project is really around the very strategic network control-point, this being Contrail, that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. This is where I provided the commentary that this is just an example of the types of engagements we are having with service providers around the world. The fact is that SP\u2019s are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering values from this facilities and the network controllers at barrister to control point in the new architecture and contrail and the traction it\u2019s seeing is a big that\u2019s very encouraging to us. Operator : The next question us from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Rami I had a question about growth, a year ago at the analyst day you had talked about 3% to 6% three year growth rate and understanding it might fluctuate in any given year. Wondering if you could comment next year might be a typical year fall within that range and how some of your new products that really ramping next year might help out in terms of growth rate next year. Thanks. Rami Rahim : We are just going to stick it will be provided you at the end of 2014 in terms of the three your view. Certainly the results that we\u2019re seeing this year give us the confidence that we can achieve that three year view in terms of growth. I think the fundamentals of the industry are solid. I think the spending environment is good. The product roadmap is healthy and you know all of those factors come together to give me the confidence in our ability to actually achieve the growth targets that we provided you. Robyn Denholm : We will provide you with some color into next year as we round out this year. In terms of what we\u2019re expecting from a growth rate perspective. Sanjiv Wadhwani : I guess just a quick follow up. When you look at the new products, do you think that could add to some dimension in growth? Just given that starting to ramp next year? Just qualitatively, not just in terms of the actual addition or subtraction in numbers? Robyn Denholm : Yes. As we\u2019ve been saying consistently, our new product revenue for the products we announced earlier this year in March, will contribute very modestly to revenue in 2015. We expect revenue growth for next year to be more substantial. Operator : The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : I wanted to ask a similar question. If we go back to last year, last fall you are kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenants that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers to increase their spending, particularly on core as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time as we fast forward to this year, service provider spending at least among the U.S. is still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I\u2019m wondering if you can give a little bit of color what maybe allowing the carriers in the U.S. o do that? And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be. It seems like with the good growth you\u2019ve seen with the U.S. Tier 1 the kicking in, perhaps can be an accelerator and then similarly, on security you\u2019re delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you\u2019re characterizing it as a 2015 as a stabilization. So if that\u2019s the case we expect to see further acceleration in security in 2016 as you turn the corner and start to enter into what you think to be true growth. Thanks. Rami Rahim : There\u2019s a lot in there I\u2019m going to see if I can address at all. First in terms of carrier spending. As I mentioned things are largely playing out as we expected in the second half and I expect the next quarter, Q4 also be a good quarter to also be a good quarter for us in terms of carrier spending. The dynamics between core and edge actually I\u2019ve been consistently saying it\u2019s become very difficult to break out those two domains. Much of the pressure that\u2019s happening in telecom networks today is in fact happening in the metro, it\u2019s happening in the edge and a lot of the product that have traditionally been used or deployed in the core are now actually going in the edge to deal with that tropic capacity. So I\u2019m really more measuring our success in carrier routing from overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we\u2019re seeing some improvement in telcos we are not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth, we are counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We\u2019re seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the enterprise, government, and different geos, all of that is kicking in to support the overall growth. And it really then demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and also from a geo standpoint. On security, again this year is all about stability as Robyn mentioned essentially we are flat year-to-date. We still have I feel very good on where the work that has been done thus far on shoring up our competitiveness in the service provider high-end security space and in the cloud. We still have some more work to do on the enterprise side and just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite. That essentially brings to bear our security switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that\u2019s so important to our enterprise customers in the campus and in the canvas domain and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now and I think that plays out in resulting growth in 2016 timeframe. Robyn Denholm : Let me just added to the first part of your question, James. On telco we actually saw good growth in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year and globally, modestly in the U.S. but globally it was a nice quarter for growth. So we\u2019re actually anticipating that diversification to continue and we are expecting that to continue to improve again modestly. Operator : The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha : I guess it\u2019s for Rami and a lots been [indiscernible] call about diversifying your revenue base versus the charts that we saw last year, this update on how some diversified you are now? And if you can\u2019t get some of those numbers may be can you help us with the [Technical Difficulty] comfortable whereby Juniper could see through cycle revenue growth well it continues and you could offset on a continuous basis the typical service provider cycle that we see? Thanks. Rami Rahim : I know that data that we had provided has been very useful and I think we can look to provide an updated view in the future. From just a qualitative standpoint, the strategy itself is definitely working out in terms of helping us offset what is in fact a cyclical industry. Do we believe that we can completely offset large cycles that might happen in telcos? No. I think that\u2019s a pretty tall order but that said I think we\u2019ve demonstrated with not just a diversity from a market vertical standpoint but diversity across the technology areas, switching routing securities and diversity across geos. I mean you look at Q3, enterprise kicked in and also EMEA and APAC kicked in that helped us in again, creating the overall growth. I think the strategy works. I think it has legs and I think that it will help us in the future. Kulbinder Garcha : [Technical Difficulty]. And maybe just one very quick. There\u2019s a question I want to ask about the question from the Juniper perspective it seems to me that you guys are hitting most of the targets were heading toward most of the targets you want. The ones I have always been question about is and given that you are achieving your working structure generating good cash return returning cash growing without the time that Juniper on the M&A do think maybe accelerate some of your growth or is that how you see the business? Rami Rahim : Yes. I\u2019m actually open to M&A and it will be as I said mentioned historically very much complementary to our strategy. Tuck-in type technology M&A\u2019s that will be easy to integrate and work to accelerate the strategy that we are already executing on. Having said that, we are so focused right now on putting the finishing touches on what is a huge product pipeline that\u2019s all coming to bear into the market simultaneously around the same time frame I honestly do not want to distract the team too much from that right now. So timing is going to be important, but that said, I do believe that M&A can be a good part of our strategy with the right timing and certainly something that\u2019s complimentary to our overall strategy. Operator : Next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Sue : Robyn I think on the cost side you should just go spend the money so please go ahead. As it relates to the tech competitors some are moving quickly to combined a stack converge and seeing some hyper converge. Are there platform changes your customers are asking you to make or is it still about combining discrete assets of switching, routing, contrail, just trying to get a understanding of the long tail migration opportunity with your current product set and how you might see clean page data centers being deployed. Rami Rahim : I will say you\u2019re actually hitting on a topic, it\u2019s very important to me and to my leadership team. Today the growth that we\u2019ve seen with Juniper products in the cloud have largely been as a result of companies, enterprises, telcos, cloud providers that have the ability to choose best of breed and to combine them themselves in ways that solved the business challenges that they face. That said, there is a part of the marketing segment of the market, the value out-of-the-box converged architectures that include compute storage, networking and the software automations stack on top of that. We have in fact been working with a number of different partners so we probably have around half dozen right now, regional partners that are working with Juniper as well as storage providers and compute providers to build those converged stack offerings. They typically are very targeted to specific market verticals so some might be targeted towards healthcare, others toward retail and it\u2019s still early days. These are relatively new product offerings, but I actually I feel pretty confident in their ability to at least give us some access to that converged or hyper converged market. Mark Sue : And can we assume that Juniper is resorting back to the practice of not revealing products that might actually already are being tested by some of your customers? Rami Rahim : Sorry the question was not revealing are not reviewing? Robyn Denholm : The practice of not announcing products before they are scheduled to be shipped Rami Rahim : I see what you\u2019re saying. I think there is a balance here. The practice of revealing products years in advance of ship I say yes, that\u2019s something that is well behind us. We certainly will announce within a certain reasonable timeframe like a couple of quarters type of timeframe. And I think there is value in doing that because what you do is you prime the market. You get it ready for adoption but we are very careful in not revealing our cards if you will too early. That said, there is always a lot of deep dialogue and engagement under NDA with our customers where we\u2019re not only revealing the products but we\u2019re actually making them stakeholders in the developments of those products and making sure that those products satisfy their specific requirements. Operator : Next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : I had a couple questions. First looking at your enterprise business, this is the first quarter in five, after five quarters, where you had year-over-year declines in your enterprise business that you actually had a positive year-over-year growth in the enterprise. So Rami it will be great to get some color as to how much of this is sort of a little bit of reversion to the mean after five back quarters versus your confidence in them, more sustainable result out of that business and I\u2019d like to apply that question as well to your security business. Clearly you have had two very good quarters, I\u2019m wondering how much of it is just a reflection of the fact that clients have been sitting on the sidelines now that you have refreshed a product that are kind of updating architectures versus their true new wins, new customer additions here. So if you could give some color in the security, how much of the progress here is on your existing install base versus adding new customers that would be great. And then for you, Robyn, just as we think about that next year, can you help us think about how to think about March quarter\u2019s [indiscernible] and also pro forma tax rate for 2016. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Sure. Let me start. First on the enterprise. I am certainly pleased with the performance. Three reason, cloud, cloud, and cloud are essentially why we\u2019re seeing this success that we are seeing in the enterprise. There\u2019s been a lot of focus on targeting enterprises and service providers that are building out cloud architectures and the product portfolio that go to market focus the support infrastructure we have in place is all geared towards tapping into that segment. And it is a growing segment. At the end of the day while switching for example is a huge total addressable market, the cloud element of it is the part that\u2019s in fact growing and we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I\u2019ve laid out this year from the standpoint of partnerships. Creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall enterprise opportunity specifically as it relates to the cloud. In security, it really is a combination, in fact there has been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally liked the SRX, especially the high-end SRX and the branch SRX that we are tapping into that need to modernize their infrastructure and we\u2019re tapping into that as well. Again, we are not calling mission accomplished yet in security. There is a lot more work to do and there might be a couple of gyrations here and there as we get to overall long-term growth which happens next year. Robyn Denholm : And I think the other area on the enterprise that\u2019s also we\u2019re focusing on the channel as well. Using a lot of the enterprise wins that we\u2019ve been developing ourselves in terms of both the cloud area that Rami mentioned as well as in the security side to reinvigorate the channel and put design wins and that type of thing with them so that we can enable the channel to replicate them. Ittai you asked two questions. One to me, one was on the tax rate, what was the other question? Ittai Kidron : How should we think about seasonality heading into the March quarter? Robyn Denholm : Okay. So let me talk about seasonality. At this point it\u2019s obviously early. We\u2019ll give you more color next quarter\u2019s call but we\u2019re not anticipating anything outside of the normal seasonality that we would see between Q4 and Q1. So typically we see a reduction somewhere between 7% and 10%, that type of thing. So we\u2019re not expecting at this point anything different to that. We\u2019ll give you an update on that on the next call. In terms of the tax rate, there was a lot of excitement in the tax rate commentary this quarter which is not usual. So on the pro forma GAAP tax rate, we will expect a slightly reduced rate. Obviously the R&D tax credit is not being renewed has had an increase in our tax rate overall for the year. If that gets renewed that can have close to 2% tax rate adjustment. So at this point we wouldn\u2019t see a significantly different tax rate for next year except for the addition of the R&D tax credit. Operator : The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : I took out coverage of group from Brian, so looking forward to working with you and your team. My question is really on the sustainability and visibility of the order flow in cloud and cable. Honestly I would like to ask a question in terms of that segment has been doing well for you, cloud and cable providers you also mentioned SaaS etcetera. So are these one-offs kind of a near-term order flow, do you see sustainability from a use case point of view that this could kind of extend over a multiple quarters and then the a quick follow-on to that would be on the service provider routing side. You had the routing business, is this is expectations in Q3 is flattish. [Indiscernible] so give us kind of your view of the order commentary there in routing heading into Q4 and into over the next few quarters. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Let me start and I\u2019ll see if Robyn has anything to add. Cloud and cable, I think those verticals have had lumpiness historically and I\u2019m not let\u2019s say concerned about the relative weakness that we had sequentially in cloud in Q3. If you look at the year-over-year it\u2019s actually quite healthy growth. Very healthy growth in fact. When I look at the fundamentals of cloud, the need to build efficient wide-area networks to connect the data centers together to connect the data centers to the consumers of cloud services to peer endpoint is all absolutely there and I don\u2019t anticipate that changing so long-term trajectory for this vertical, the cost vertical I believe is actually healthy and the products that we\u2019re building with the specific capabilities for this vertical the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, controllability are well understood by Juniper and we\u2019re developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable as well can be lumpy, it has been lumpy historically. I think there is consolidation that\u2019s happening in the cable industry that will result in some short-term uncertainty if you will, but the long-term prospects for us in cable I think are quite good. I see routing all up, I think as I mentioned I feel actually quite good about where we are with respect to routing. Bookings were strong, I think the sequential softness in Q3 in North America specifically had to do with timing of projects, a difficult compare relative to Q2 with the revenue recognition event that we had in Q2 that we talked to you about. Visibility is good and the roadmap is excellent. Robyn Denholm : Thank you so much. Thank you Vijay, and I want to thank each of you for your great questions and your interest in Juniper Networks. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s tele-conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Kathleen and welcome everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing and as a challenger in this industry, we here to shape it and lead it. Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I am pleased to report that in 2015 our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year excluding Junos Pulse driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8% respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there is still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are leaving in disruptive times and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving; new architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software desegregation and white box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunities ahead and we intend to capture it. Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving a 192 countries up from 60 plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low latency and high volume communication of information. They will require new high performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting edge technologies. In 2016, we planned to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help to accelerate our existing strategy. We planned to do so through continued execution and product innovation as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complement our organic R&D strategy. For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form this market is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet optical networking and provide our customers with open software driven solutions that are automated highly programmable cost efficient and offer tremendous service agility. It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational cost increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud is often required new and network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area networks, datacenters and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of network and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real valuable over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue overtime. I remain optimistic about our entire product line and across routing, switching, security and automation software has spent five solution domain, datacenter, core, EDGE, Campus and branch and access and navigation. We shipped several new products last quarter including the ATX-500 hardened access switch, the GFX 5200 top-of-rack data center switch, the SRX 1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX Line Card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. Now I know cyber security is top of buying for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers and Juniper strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and insurance of all of our products at Juniper. Again this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments maybe lumpy, my team and I had set out the following three operating principles for managing the business in 2016. First, we intend to take a prudent stand while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets. Second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016, we reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis. Third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. We will seek to fulfill our commitments to continuous process improvement in execution and I look forward to share and yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day. Before I conclude I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today, Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change and frankly significant accomplishments. I\u2019ve always been impressed with Robyn\u2019s willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. Robyn has developed in outstanding finance IT and operations organization and has still a strong operational and financial discipline in the company complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have with the great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. And you have been in Juniper since before the IPO and I know you have been in all parts of the company over the 16 plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. I also know that you appreciate where this company has been but more importantly are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership we will continue in this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn thank you and Ken we look forward to your new role. And with that I will turn the call over to Robyn for review of our full year and quarterly financial results. Robyn Denholm : Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, seven were telcos and three were cloud or cable providers, of these customers five were located outside of the U.S. reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple vertical and geographies. Our underlined demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter with a products book-to-bill greater than one and ending product backlog at $517 million up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially productive differed revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. I'm especially pleased that for the quarter we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin, an earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $117 million lower than the previous quarter primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong with year-over-year revenue increases across all vertical geographies and technologies. As anticipated in the second half of 2015 U.S. tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year 5 were Telco, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year we expanded operating margins significantly by 3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non GAAP basis which reflects our followed execution focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share counts. We are pleased that we were making good progress through our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue. And towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. For the year we had strong cash flows from operations of $893 million primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million as we focus on investments to draw a long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1.143 billion of shares and paid $156 million in dividends. Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we have good visibility into the first quarter. The mid-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness closed very conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong which we impacted into our outlook. You can find the data and outlooks to Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. Now, I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we have substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment. We wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 timeframe. Going forward we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividend. As a reminder in March of 2016 we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance subject to market and other business conditions. Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2 and we will provide more information on the financial data of the combined operations after the transaction closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have material impact throughout 2016 earnings. To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model and as we begin the year we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitments. For the past 8 and half years I have been privilege to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational disciplined that is in play. I also believe that the company is in great hand with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitments to Juniper's success. And now with that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions here, one just in your comments about trying to inject more conservatives and more prudence around the outlook. Can you talk about relative to what you're seeing in terms of the macro? Have you seen anything what's in your customer base that is you found to be somewhat incremental or calls per calls in terms of one customer vertical staying the narrow at one product segments and that as part of the certain see a major change in the sales most of that relative to sort of prior few months. And then I have a follow up. Rami Rahim : Yeah sure, Mark. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll just pass it on to Robyn if she wishes to want to add anything else. First and foremost, I have to say that I feel good about the fundamentals of the business and of course the need for networking technology across all of our market verticals. The fact of the matter is there are some very important problems to be solved in the area of networking keeping up with capacity and delivering services over those networks and so forth. Also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effects on spending patterns and deployments with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we managed the business and we invest with that assumption in mind and that's exactly what we're doing. Robyn Denholm : Yeah, and just to add to that. I mean we did really have a great Q4 and we got good visibility. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the backlog was $517 million up significantly year-over-year and so as deferred revenue. Having said that as Rami mentioned, there is a lot of market volatility out the and in our experience that has from time-to-time caused some lumpiness in our deployments or order patterns. And so it's more a buyback cautiousness in terms of what could unfold as we move forward here. But we've been cautious with our guided for the first quarter. Mark Moskowitz : Okay. And then the second question is more longer term in nature thinking about the second half of '16 and into 2017, Juniper and your leadership have done a nice job in terms of refocusing on both security and switching and we're hearing that a lot of big customers are starting to really keep it tie and bring Juniper for in for some other piece with this. Kind a curious if you talk about the cadence there the sales motion and are you having to hire more people one. And then two, is this more of a 2017 potential or it could be a second half of '16 in terms of meet again a boost of on those initiatives in both security and switching thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah thanks. Sure Mark. Thank you. If you look at 2015, we said that it's really important for us to diversify our business across geos across technology areas, across market verticals. You're touching on the diversity and technology areas. And that is very much a matter of our strategy and I'm very happy with how the team executed to that effect in the last year. Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that I think is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team the go-to-market team our marketing team. And I feel that the opportunities there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas, in security in particular since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us. Because as you know we started with a bit of deficit just a year ago we refocused our strategy, we enhanced our product set, we definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there are still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security. I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago. Mark Moskowitz : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay, thanks Mark. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Yeah. Hey, good afternoon hi Rami, Robyn. Quick question from me around you mentioned your guidance was conservative primarily on the uncertainty you're noting in macro order lumpiness. You also noted weakness in US enterprise. So my question for us is if you could give us any color on the lumpiness comments which product segment are customer set of customer that's coming from very helpful. Rami Rahim : Let me start Vijay. I don't think it's any it's specific to anyone technology area or customer vertical. As I mentioned I actually feel good about the way that we're executing and about the fundamentals of the business the need for the kind of technologies, how our products that we're developing and innovating in are going to addressing those requirements in 2016 all up. I just believe that as we start 2016 and you see the incredible amount of volatility in the market across really all markets and all geos, it's a good idea for us to plan and manage the business with the assumption that there could be some lumpiness. And I don't think if they say specific to anyone particular vertical. Robyn Denholm : Yeah, and just amplify what Rami said, and just to remind you our enterprise business typically is down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. That's a normal phase and no pattern that we've see. So obviously we expected it to be up year-on-year but quarter-on-quarter we do expect that to be down and Rami addressed that in his prepared remarks. In terms of the Telco sector just globally we had a very strong Telco quarter in the fourth quarter as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And typically it does take a little bit of time to those deployments to be digested and move forward. So we're constructive on the year I think in terms of how reviewing the FY16 year for our business. But we're been cautious in the near term just give the volatility as Rami mentioned. Vijay Bhagavath : A quick follow up is on the BTI announcement. I mean we personally think it's a strategic positive for the company getting into data center vertical in particular. So the question for you is around how do you manage margins because optical margins as you all know more in the high mid-to-high 40s your margins at in the mid-60s. So help us understand the margin put and takes that optical getting into your portfolio. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah sure Vijay. Well first I'm happy to hear that you think it' a good idea and I agree with you completely. I wanted just to make sure everybody understands. The goal of this acquisition is not to build a large optical business inside of the Juniper. The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy, this is actually strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments data center interconnect in particular metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later. And so this acquisition when it closes in the Q2 timeframe is essentially a way for us to accelerate our innovation in this area by getting key building blocks and of course the talent that will help us to do it. So that's why as Robyn mentioned earlier we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on our 2016 financials. Vijay Bhagavath : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Vijay. Next question operator? Operator : And the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thanks Rami and Robyn. I hate to ask you but just a clarification of the last two responses in the question a little clarification I appreciate and first of all we appreciate the prudence given the macro backdrop but I just want to make sure I understand when you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness one month in I recognize it's not very long it generally it\u2019s always a late month for the first quarter but have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading a lots of journal in CNN or listening to all the other companies had announced? And then my question will be on margins you had really strong services gross margin number relative to what you\u2019ve done over the last year to in product gross margin was somewhere between the real question going forward what should we expect is the 63 plus you did in service is that in your norm were there extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for this strength and some more question on products. Robyn Denholm : So Paul thanks for the questions. Let me touch on the guidance and the outlook for Q1 first so as we said if I go back 90 days ago what I said on the earnings call is that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down and what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down so it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that\u2019s us being cautious and prudent. We\u2019re not seeing any wholesale signs as any weaknesses Rami mentioned before, having said that it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines we\u2019re talking about capital purchases many of my piece around the world will start tighten things unless macro environment changes and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re being cautious and prudent it is more experienced than actually what we\u2019re seeing. So on the margin side I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4 it\u2019s up a couple of ticks\u2019 year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services came and the business around services is doing very well within the company, the team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase. At the same time, it\u2019s improving our customer satisfaction score so I'm very pleased with that. We move to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins again it\u2019s up year-over-year from Q1 of last year and that\u2019s primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from products so this is relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from product because of PS revenue as part of services but we\u2019re very pleased with our services gross margin. Paul Silverstein : Robyn I wish you well. Robyn Denholm : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Paul. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So maybe on the outlook you\u2019ve pulled together and the comments you made about uncertainty do you have like a differentiated view when we think about your plans so did you have more or less the ability for service providers, vertical plans, enterprise and so how does that look like from a regional standpoint, so we see very clearly your very good performance today is mostly driven by the U.S. Are you concerned about a slowdown, a domestic slowdown as well or is still most of the uncertainty in international market? And then maybe along with the same line one last question what\u2019s your view on the data center spending so we've seen a few data points recently potentially showing the data center spending could be slowing is that something you see something you anticipate? Thanks a lot. Rami Rahim : Yes, Pierre so let me start first as far as the outlook really I think Robyn covered it well. There is nothing specific to anyone particular vertical or even geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are.... if you look at our switching market share although it's actually nudging up were still relatively small and for that reason the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnects with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we are talking about and data center is in fact the area where we are strongest today from a security stand point. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build out of cloud for Telecom operator and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with six additional wins in the Q4 time frame alone is really healthy and we definitely see a pulling other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside I still view data center and in particular the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper. Pierre Ferragu : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thank you very much. If we look across the networking landscape, there are a few significant upgrades that seem to be kicking in this year. Couple of the carriers are moving their metro networks to 100 gig, cloud providers are moving to 25 and 50 gig in their data centers. You see enterprise data centers moving to 40 gig and then campus is moving to multi gigabyte. Of these four opportunities or any others you may want to add which ones are you involved in and which ones do you think are going to be meaningful growth driver for you this year? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks, Simona. I'd say the biggest areas of focus and where our competitive differentiation is going to be greatest as well as where our go to market attention is also the highest is in the data center opportunity. So you mentioned correctly. So they moved to 25 and 50 gig, we just introduced in the Q4 time frame the key effect 5,2000, in fact that's the first switch that we offer with a completely dis aggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That compliments the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customer at least the early versions in the hands of our customer whiles we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus I'm optimistic about. Metro 100 gigs the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100 gig deployments and I do expect to be very much relevant if you will for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center. But that's only because of the timing of the product if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call fusion architecture and that architecture really comes to provision and around the middle of this year and for large campus environments I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last, on the metro opportunity. We did mention that we introduced the latest versions of our MX line cards in the Q4 time frame. This is the MPC7 with a very dense industry leading 100 gig capacity which is perfectly time to capture the metro opportunities that you are mentioning. Simona Jankowski : Great, thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Simona. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Rami, I was hoping you could touch on some of the factors driving the strength in the routing business which posted a second consecutive quarter double-digit growth. So any insights you can provide as to where you believe we are in the customer routing cycle to what degree you think the new PTX and MX line cards can continue to sustain helping growth in that business through 2016 that would be helpful. And then Robyn I was hoping you could perhaps touch upon to what degree you expect currency to impact the outlook and perhaps some of the exchange rate assumptions that are embedded in the forecast. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay, let me start with routing. Thanks for the question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. In routing over the last few quarters, we've been taking market share and I think that's because of the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement that we're having with our service provider and enterprise customers around the world. Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX this quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really two routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the market in terms of both the software capabilities the services and the density and the performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad based strengths in service providers, this is not a common specific to just the large tier 1 this is true for service providers around the world that are building out their metro their EDGE and their cores with the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0, 3.1 and of course the densities that we offer with the MX and the PTX to help them to do that is really turning into a competitive advantage for us. Jess Lubert : Rami based on the availability of the new products, is there any reason we shouldn't expect some of the share gains we've seen in the last few quarters to continue? Rami Rahim : Share will always fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but if I look at the win rates as well as the opportunities that are ahead of us and the product roadmap. And you have to keep in mind that we have actually managed to achieve the strength that we achieved in 2015 largely without the new products ramping up. This year I think we have the benefit of the new products ramping up which I think can help us in sustaining the market share momentum. Robyn? Robyn Denholm : So just in terms of currency Jess. As I've mentioned before, we predominantly invoice the U.S. dollars. Having said that obviously with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currency, we see some and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, some modest pricing impact in those areas which we have by and large offset with cost reductions. So our assumptions are that the currency impact remains the consistent high levels of the U.S. dollar as we move forward here. Jess Lubert : Thanks guys. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Jess. Next question Mannie? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Thank you. Rami let me just wish you good luck on your next venture. Rami broad level question for you within the context of a volatile macro. I was wondering if you could comment on how you see sort of that you're shaping up. I know you guys have talked about the 3% to 6% especially given the various new products that are starting to gain traction. So just curious to get a comment of how do you think that year might shape up thanks. Rami Rahim : Well first thanks for the question Sanjiv. We're still sticking to our long-term outlook which includes '14, '15 and '16 of the 3% to 6% revenue range. And I think we will make progress towards if I look at 2016 all up. I do believe that we will make progress towards that goal. And that\u2019s true from a revenue standpoint in terms of 3% to 6% but also through from an operating margin standpoint where we expect to achieve our long-term goal of 25% all up full year annualized basis. Robyn Denholm : And Rami made '15, '16,'17 we announced it in '14. Rami Rahim : Thank you for the correction Robyn. You're absolutely right. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Just and quick follow-up as it relates to new products I mean are you expecting material sort of contribution this year or do you think this sort of ramps up as a year progresses and maybe in 2017 you'll start seeing more of the material contribution. Rami Rahim : It's both because I think it ramps up but it ramps up early this year. So I do think it will have a significant contribution to 2016 across switching and routing in particular but also security. Robyn Denholm : Yeah, and just to underscore that point and Rami mentioned that in his prepared remarks, the 2015 there was very little revenue from the new products. So it just it underscores the strength of the results in '15. And we are expecting those products to ramp as we move through '16. Sanjiv Wadhwani : Got it. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Sanjiv. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations. One clarification question then I have a follow up, so first of all the clarification question. You mentioned the currency and we know you priced mostly in US dollars and you mentioned some changes which will be offset by your cost which you've been able to do. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what you meant by those changes was that be as you lowered your price in certain geographies or you did some more rebating or what's do you mean by those changes need to be offset by cost that's a clarification. And then my main question is a lot of the other questions were asked on the other products but on switching. Can you give us a little bit of details on switching kind a maybe what's happening now versus say six months ago and kind of your outlook for switching whether be trends or product cycles, thank you very much and again congratulations. Robyn Denholm : Thank you. So in terms of the pricing commentary or the currency commentary. Obviously the U.S. dollar has been strong for quite some time now. So we have actually seen some impacts from our pricing in on international operations outside of the US which we have largely offset by the cost reductions that we've had throughout the year. So you can see the gross margin is very healthy on that product areas it's very consistent year-over-year it's also very consistent from a sequential basis. So we obviously compete in the business and we largely compete on the differentiation of our products. But there are obviously areas where we continue to work on the cost structure and reduce our cost so that we preserve the competitiveness of our overall product ranges well. Rami Rahim : Yeah, and Jim on the switching question, fiscal year 2015 we saw a 7% year-over-year increase in switching that is largely without the benefit of the new spine switches which we expect to ramp in this year. So I am bullish on our ability to grow this part of our business. I think if you look at where the opportunity lies; it's mostly in the datacenter and the cloud. This is true for all of our vertical market segments whether if that our telecom operators that are building out their next generation distributed Telco cloud architectures transforming their network locations to scale out data centers from which they are delivering value to their customers certainly through for enterprises that are moving to a hybrid cloud architecture. I think we can benefit from that. And then again I will put in that plug for - because I think that's really making us very relevant to the next generation architectures where there is a high degree of automation that is being applied how switching is deployed. And we're seeing that is a very strategic and sticky part of the sales motion for our customers across all vertical markets. Robyn Denholm : Yeah and just to underscore that point, we grew switching 7% year-over-year without very much benefit at all from the new product. So I think to Rami's point we're very pleased with the switching performance that also plays with how we out moving forward from a competitive point of view with the switching line up that we have. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Jim. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah hi. Thanks. This is Ashwin [ph] on behalf of Rod. Hey good. Robyn Denholm : Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : Okay actually question is on Europe it looks like Europe was down on a year-over-year basis in Q4. I'm wondering if you're expecting that region to return to growth anytime soon given that fiscal your Q1 guidance implies growth. Rami Rahim : Yeah, sure Ashwin. So Europe actually you're right, from a revenue standpoint it took a little bit of a step back but actually from a booking standpoint Europe was quite strong year-over-year and sequentially. So I'm not concerned. I think in Europe the area where we're seeing the greatest success is with the telecom operators. The win rate, the level of engagement on some of the next generation of architectures in not just routing but in switching and security and Contrail is very good and so for that reason again for 2016 as a whole I actually think Europe is going to be good. There has been a very deliberate focus inside of Juniper to make sure that there is the good diversity across geographies and we\u2019re taking that seriously I'm very pleased with how the team is executing. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks for the color. Just one more follow up Rami you\u2019ve commented that you\u2019re expecting operating margins to expand in fiscal \u201816, I wanted to understand how contingent is that on revenue growth coming through and I just wanted to understand your planning assumptions there? Rami Rahim : Yes, I think we are expecting that revenue will expand this year if you think about it from the full year standpoint and with that said we\u2019re essentially making sure that we\u2019re investing in a way that is commensurate with that expansion in revenue. We\u2019re not going to as I have said many times in the past invest ahead of that growth. Robyn Denholm : Okay, great. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you the next question is from George Nadar [ph] of Jeffries. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks a lot guys. I guess more of a housekeeping question I was curious about what your emerging markets exposure is right now I\u2019ve seem to have lost track of that I'm specifically just in countries like Brazil, Russia, China places where the currencies have really devalued or economy slowdowns where is that now and how do you feel about those areas going forward? Thanks. Robyn Denholm : Thanks George. We don\u2019t actually breakout our emerging markets number but what I will say is I did provide some commentary about Asia Pacific if you excluded China we\u2019d actually be up quite significantly in terms of the quarter. It\u2019s in my commentary and in terms of Brazil, it\u2019s a small business for us but I can\u2019t actually say we\u2019re down in the quarter and that\u2019s in the Americas result, so in terms of the APAC results they would have been up I think it\u2019s about 10% but we\u2019ll come back to you with that number. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks George. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Mironovic [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. I was just wondering there was some news about Facebook\u2019s open compute project getting the back in telcos like AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telecom wanted to get your perspective on that and what you\u2019re hearing when you talk to customers? Rami Rahim : Sure, thanks Steve. This is an industry where most of the innovation and the investment goes into software but much of the business model are tied to hardware I mean if you take a look at Juniper as an example 85% of all of our development resources are software resources that is where the crux or the majority of our R&D investment actually lies. I do believe that overtime business models will adjust so that\u2019s more of the value is going to be monetized through software and I think we\u2019re taking meaningful steps in that direction. So in the Q4 timeframe we announced our disaggregated architecture, our customers were very pleased we got a lot of kudos if you will from our customers, telecom operators and enterprises mostly on the telco side that this is the right step to take. Do I believe that there\u2019s going to be an overnight shift in business model, no I don\u2019t I think in this industry everything is sort of unfold and multi-years but I do think that we are taking the steps necessary to make sure that in a world where wide box switching starts to become more prominent that we will be able to participate, to add value and of course create shareholder value from that transition as well? Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And Robyn there was a comment in the formal remarks about moderately elevated pricing pressure have you addressed that in your comments so today are you seeing something competitively that\u2019s different? Robyn Denholm : No it\u2019s a combination of factors but we did address it obviously the currency impacts is seen through that pricing and any other factors that are in there. But we are offsetting that with cost reductions as you could see in the quarter from the gross margin so slightly elevated just what I said in the prepared remarks. And just coming back to George\u2019s question about emerging markets in terms of Asia Pacific it was about 4% full year, we excluded China region we\u2019re eventually up a little bit so you can see there has been a sustain period of time, quite a reduction in that business. Although I will say that it in the fourth quarter we actually saw it grow a little from the third quarter. So from a China specific perspective. Kathleen Nemeth : Great, thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Couple of questions. First, Rami can you get into the enterprise business and the performance in the fourth quarter. I have to go back 10 years and I never could have found a quarter where your enterprise business took such a significant decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So you can give us a little bit more color on what's going there. That will be great and second just wanted a big picture standpoint. Do you have any view on what capital spending will with carriers this year? How it's going to be waited second half versus first half, any color on that will be great? Rami Rahim : Okay. Let me start. Thanks Ittai. On the enterprise side Q3 was a very strong revenue quarter for us. If you recall it was actually double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So the step back that we took in enterprise honestly I'm not too worried about it. I think that is largely as a result of the timing of large enterprise deployment and especially government. Government was actually very strong for us in Q3 and there was a bit more weakness in government just because various factors in the Q4 time frame. If I think about the opportunity for us in the enterprise and our ability to capture it especially as it pertained to cloud deployment. I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016. I think that's the net of it. Expecting some one peanut especially in the larger enterprises in government is something that is pretty normal. Robyn Denholm : Yeah and actually I'll just add to that, our enterprise business for the fourth quarter was largely as we were expecting. So not anything out of the ordinary. The full year for enterprise was actually 8% which is a very good result for us for the full year rental price and it just speaks to the diversity again that Rami underscored through the commentary here. If you look at our full service provider business that was up about the same sort of level, 7% and enterprise was up 8%. So within any one quarter you will see some lumpiness between the sectors and between the verticals in the market. Just because of the deployment cycle that actually overall the diversity is working us and that it gives good gross in both areas over a full year period of time. Rami Rahim : On the second question I think it was around sort of the capital expenditures for telecom operators in particular. I mean we are seeing the same reports that you are seeing it's still early that in the year. But it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For Telcos in particular the most important thing we need to do, it is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next generation architectures that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CBE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center like entities. I feel really good about the level of engagement that we are having with our telco operator to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real. I think there are some real good proof points of telcos. Even large telcos that are making significant progress in that direction. And then finally, it's important for us to continue the diversification of business. So that we can increase the predictability of our business overtime across all vertical market segment. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Kathleen Nemeth : Thank you, Ittai. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Fall [ph] of Nomura. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thanks very much. And Robyn I'd like to add my congratulations to you and appreciation for all your help with me over the years. Two questions really I think first is big picture on routing you had a really nice series of quarters and they were quite good on that, I contrast that a little bit to what I hear out of the larger U.S. Telcos who have been pretty clear that NFE is an opportunity for them to reduce spending on what they call big iron in the core of the network. So I'm wondering if you could compare and contrast that a little bit and help us I think that through and then I've got a follow up. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah, sure. I will start with this routing question. I think actually where if you look where you see virtualization becoming most relevant. It's in areas of the market that are tend to be little bit less performance tend to be more around the customer premises equipment is really around the end goal of automation. And we have developed of what I think are really competitive solutions to address that particular opportunity. The big iron stuff - it's really around keeping up with traffic patterns with growth in traffic. And if you look at for examples the enhancements that we are making in the PTX where we're going from a terabit per slot to 3 terabits per slot industry leadership from form standpoint. I can tell you that is absolutely hitting the mark in terms of the kinds of technologies that are telecom operators are looking for to cost effectively address the insatiable based our traffic growth in their networks. Robyn Denholm : Jeff your follow-up? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you. And then the second one is could you help us a little bit to understand when we can expect revenues from the QFX-10000 I think that still at one point and might have been in the first half of this year and I'm not sure if I A have that right in B if so I'm interpreting your remarks is being more of a second half 2016 story. Rami Rahim : We well we expect the revenue ramp to start in the first half. It will obviously be more meaningful in the second half. But we do expect that the revenue will start in the first half. Robyn Denholm : Yeah, I think it's fair to say that we expect that those revenues in the first half that right will start in the second half I think is the way we would characterize it. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, okay. Thank you to both for helping me parse through that language. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Jeff. So we are running up to the hour. We have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, our final question is from Jason Muland [ph] of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for slipping me in. I had a couple of quick ones hopefully and thank you for giving the color on the top 10 customers. And the question there with more success in cable and cloud is Rami as the business becoming more concentrated around key customers or is that the wrong way to look at it. Rami Rahim : No I think it's actually getting more diverse across vertical markets, cloud, cable telecom operators large enterprises federal governments and so on. And I think that's good because it's adding a greater level of predictability to the business. I don't think we're done I mean I think that there is always going to be some lumpiness I mean our exposure to telecom operator is still quite high so there is going to be some lumpiness to the business which is why so important for us to continue in 2016 on our strategy of diversification across vertical markets across geos and also across technology areas of switching revenue security. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then a quick follow up. On the comments about volatility across all markets and geos and then with security specifically ScreenOS is all but gone and you've got traction at the high end of the SRX market. Should we expect to see more resiliency in security relative to other market just given the nature of that business. Rami Rahim : Yeah I have said in the past that this 2015 will be the year of stabilizing security and then we would start to see modest growth in 2016. So at the end of 2015 I think it's we can say that we exceeded our expectations last year. Securities grew 5% full year year-to-year comparison. And I think that's not an accident it is a result of some really great work by a lot of people to Juniper that I'm extremely proud of. There you're going to see a rolling thunder of security enhancements that we will make across managements, where we knew that we have some work to do to better penetrate the enterprise with the area of next gen firewall capabilities that are cloud offered that this product is called the sky advanced threat prevention that's in beta today that essentially starts to ship shortly in the next few months. We just wrapped up a customer and partner events actually more of the partner events just earlier this months, where we heard first hand from our partner that they are feeling much better about where we are in the security today relative to where we just a year ago. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate the color. Thanks Rami. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks Jason. And thank you everyone for joining us today. As always we appreciate all of your great questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Kathleen, and welcome everyone. Despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year resulted in customers taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployments which impacted revenue in the quarter. As we enter the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full-year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model. Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continued to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance and automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with the introduction of our QFX10008 spine switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solution for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center, the most flexible data center edge routing product, our industry-leading MX Universal Edge Router, the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high-end SRX, and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN Controller, which once again was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely-used commercially-available controller in the world for the third consecutive time. Second, our solutions for wide-area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro, and core is now unparalleled, with the introduction of our newest PTX line card coupled with our multilayer optimization controller, NorthStar, which we expect to soon combine with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software, and in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength, and leverages our heritage in a way that is highly aligned with how we believe networks will evolve over time. We also introduced Juniper's Software-Defined Secure Network that leverages our recently (4:44) shipping security products like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative cloud-based day zero anti-malware ATP solution, and our refreshed, branch focused, and mid-range SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat detection and enforcement. To complement our solutions portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo to build next-generation converged data center solutions for enterprise and web-scale customers. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and Amdocs to deliver NFV-based solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. Now, let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the three elements of our business \u2013 security, routing, and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transitions that affected demand of some of our older SRX security products. In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise, a vastly enhanced version of our Security Director management software, and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. I have said before that as we grow this area of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way. But I feel good about the long-term roadmap we're executing on and the confidence that we are building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depend on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud. In routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX ExpressPlus products, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycles as well as several important design wins. I'm pleased with our performance in switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design wins with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers. There is no shortage of change occurring in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customers. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments in technology innovations are making possible. As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis. I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty, and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement efforts. Now, I'll turn it over to Ken. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks. The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns due to macroeconomic factors, and to a lesser extent, greater than anticipated weakness due to product transitions in the campus and branch security. Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in the Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies. Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was an enterprise. Of these customers, three were located outside of the United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a modest increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe the implementation has gone well. However, order processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 days to 55 days in Q2 2016. As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and system will take several months. We are confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies as we move forward. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from our acquisition of BTI Systems which closed April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximately $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to breakout financial details going forward. From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. For the full year, we are focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remain constructive on revenue growth for 2016. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter, of driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding operating margins, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day. And now, with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. The first question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to first ask about operating margins. You're guiding them down to about 22% in the June quarter, but then up for the full year relative to last year which would imply a pretty significant improvement in the second half. So if you can just address that. And then secondarily, I wanted to clarify the revenue outlook for the year. When you say you're constructive, does that mean that you're guiding for a revenue increase? And also that seems a little bit more a positive language versus that in the pre-announcement. So just curious if some of the recent design wins you were referencing has contributed to that improved optimism. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Simona. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken for additional commentary. A couple of factors that are at play here. As we get into the second quarter, our visibility and our confidence is certainly better now than it was just a few weeks ago in the Q1, just in terms of the timing of some of the deployments that we referred to that we expected to hit in the Q1 timeframe to have it now move to Q2 from a telco standpoint. And also, just confidence levels associated with the enterprise business is all up. It was a slow start to the year. We started to see a recovery throughout Q1, but it really hit near the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 timeframe. And, yes, we are looking at and expecting revenue increasing for the full-year 2016. That of course means that we should have a good second half of the year, and we based that just based on the discussions we're having with our customers, timing of projects. And then importantly, we're anticipating, as we've said in the past, that our new products which are now in the market are going through proof of concepts, we're competing in certain opportunities around the world, are going to start to ramp in the second half of the year. And I'll let Ken comment more on the OpEx side in particular. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so from an OpEx perspective, the guidance of $500 million, plus or minus $5 million, is essentially flat to this quarter with the exception of adding $10 million for the BTI acquisition, so we're really maintaining a flat OpEx Q-on-Q, whereas the revenue was up 8% or over 8% at the midpoint, which is why the operating margins expand in Q-on-Q. From a year-on-year perspective it is slightly down at the midpoint compared to last year, however last year's seasonality was a bit atypical. This year, we expect the seasonality to be more in line with historical seasonality patterns and we expect our margin to grow as revenue grows throughout the year. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Simona. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. I just wanted to first follow up on Simona's question and just hopefully understand as we look out towards the second half of the year, to what extent operating margin will be driven by better growth or should we expect some additional cost savings there as we get beyond Q2. And then I was hoping perhaps for Rami, you could update us on the timing of the QFX10016, provide some additional details regarding the pipeline you're seeing develop for the QFX10008 and what's giving you confidence these platforms are likely to win against some of the competitive platforms in the market and why customers are picking the QFX over the alternatives. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Jess. Let me start with the second question first, and then certainly Ken and I can address the first one. The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year, the second version, which is the 2008 (sic) [QFX10008], just this last \u2013 this quarter. And we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunities. The one thing that I can say is the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is we're expanding our opportunity, and that's very evidenced and is very clear. Second certainly our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas and we're integrating that feedback in making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of here that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what is a changing competitive landscape, are very competitive both from the standpoint of scale and performance but also just in terms of the full capability of Layer 2 and Layer 3 that we've integrated into those switches. Your question around the timing of the QFX10016, it's in the second half of this year, is when we anticipate it. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly the effort and the work that we've put into the QFX10008 will go towards the work that's remaining in the QFX10016. So I feel good about the product all up. And then your question around our operating margin and how much it depends on revenue, I'll just let Ken address that. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so our constructive view on operating margin expansion, it does start with our view on the revenue for the full year. So that's clearly a key attribute to our operating margin expansion, and Rami mentioned some of the reasons why we have that constructive view. In addition to that, we're still seeing the benefit from some of the restructurings we've been going through for the last couple of years. We're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us to continuing to do that. I also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable costs as a component to our operating expenses, so that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. We will continue to drive towards our long-term model of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Should we be thinking about OpEx flattish in the second half versus the first half? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think our commitment is to be prudently managing OpEx, and also to grow operating margins, so that's what we're going to be focused on in the second half. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify the situation on the ERP, and then I had a bigger picture question. So you guys said that invoicing was delayed. Was it \u2013 can you just confirm it was all caught up at the end of Q1, or did some of those invoices push into Q2? And then Ken, I think you said 15 days of DSOs, so we've got about $180 million or so of excess in the accounts receivable \u2013 just to confirm that. And then I guess I'll ask my follow-up after you guys answer that one. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'll start with the second part. Yeah, I can confirm that is about right from a DSO perspective, so that would be additional accounts receivable as compared to what we would expect with our normal DSO targets of 45 days to 55 days. So those numbers sound right. From an ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact that we went live with the new system, and it actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the quarter back-end loaded. Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter anyway, but with the system implementation, it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effectively down for the first two weeks or three weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system on January 18, it did take some ramp-up time, not only from a system perspective, but just from a procedure and process perspective, so the growing pains and learning curve associated with that resulted in a delay as far as the timing of the orders. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then \u2013 thanks for that, Ken. And then my follow-up, the big Tier-1s that have reported so far, their CapEx has been weaker than we would have anticipated in Q1. Some telecom analysts are reducing their CapEx expectations, as seems to always happen at the beginning of the year here. I'm just curious what you guys think is happening in the U.S. from a broader point of view on those carrier budgets. Do you think they're stable? Do you think it's just a push-out of budgets further into the year as we've all gotten used to, or do you think they're actually reducing spending expectations? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Rod, this is Rami. So certainly I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S., maybe elsewhere around the world as well, are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There are a number of factors at play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just re-evaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they're developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint, and from an ability to deliver next-generation capabilities to their end-users. I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging with telecom operators very effectively in ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where our \u2013 the combination of our switching, our routing, and our orchestration software \u2013 and namely this is Contrail \u2013 is really helping us tremendously. So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next-generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going continue to run their networks hotter and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those next-gen architectures. The other things that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in the cable operators; in Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals : cable, cloud, strategic enterprises and telcos, but I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architectures. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken. A quick question and a follow-on. Your enterprise business seems to be going through large swings in revenues quarter-on-quarter. Help us understand what causes the volatility? Is it purchasing patterns? A certain segment of the enterprise market? Is it campus and brands? Data center switching? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Vijay. So you're absolutely right that enterprise is off to a weak start in 2016. I think there are a number of factors. First and foremost, there was a slow start from a macro standpoint. And as we said, it did improve, but improved only near the end of the Q1 timeframe. It's not the only factor. I think there were product transitions that affected us as well, affected us, quite frankly, more than what we had expected. The areas where those product transitions, I think, hurt us in the Q1 timeframe were mostly in cloud where we had some transitions in our \u2013 sorry, it's not cloud. I should say campus, where we had transitions in our switching product lines, in particular, the EX. And also in security where \u2013 as you know in security, we have for the last year been executing on a new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers, and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance towards end-of-life-ing some of our older SRX products with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity \u2013 engineering and go-to-market \u2013 to think about the newer products, the next-generation products, things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products. And I do think that that had more of an impact than we initially expected in the Q1 timeframe. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect, and a quick follow-on, Rami, if I may, on edge routing. Your MX product is obviously a flagship here in edge routing. So we have seen early order strength from CommScope this morning, they've beaten res (26:49) numbers, macrocell densification, AWS-3 spectrum auction build-outs. Would it be reasonable to assume that edge routing would kind of naturally follow some of the wireless capacity upgrades, because traffic has to be aggregated? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't know if it's just edge routing, I would say it's routing all up. Certainly as you put more capacity into spectrum and to the air, that will ultimately see its way into fiber and will require that your routing keep pace. Now, on the routing side, we're actually seeing now very good momentum in our PTX product line, right? We saw both year-over-year as well as sequential growth in the PTX product line. And keep in mind that both the PTX and the MX are not yet fully benefiting from the enhancements that we have announced that will start to see their way into the performance of those products in a meaningful way in the second half of this year. So when I think about capacity requirements in routing, whether it's driven by cloud providers or in the telco space, or aggregation of mobile sites, or in high enterprise, I think competitively, we are very good right now. I feel very good about our competitive positioning. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Rami, just any further color on the timing of these Tier-1 U.S. and EMEA push-outs? Is it related to sort of the weaker CapEx that we saw in Q1? Or were there some other issues going on over there? And then, quick follow up to that, MX was down sequentially. Was it all related to all these projects that got pushed out, or was there some other stuff going on with the MX? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Sanjiv. As far as timing is concerned for these telcos, I can tell you that where we are right now just in Q2, and based on our visibility of the deployments that we had anticipated in the Q1 timeframe, we were much more confident about the fact that those deployments are going happen in the Q2 and beyond sort of timeframe. And yes, I mean, the MX was essentially flat year-over-year, down sequentially, which is not atypical just based on seasonality. And the PTX, however, as I mentioned, is seeing some great momentum both year-over-year and sequentially. As far as the MX business is concerned, yeah, I would say that part of that is related to the timing of the telco spend that we had anticipated in Q1 now moving to Q2 and beyond. Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Trevor Bacon of Barclays. Please go ahead. Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. My question revolves around the security business. So 2015 was supposed to be the year of stabilization, and I understand there are puts and takes, but there has been a limited recovery in what is otherwise a generally attractive growth market. So what gives you the confidence that your strategy is the right one? And at what point would you consider alternatives for the business, given that it seems it will be difficult to grow this year given where we've set the bar in the first quarter? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Trevor. So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with a refocused strategy, and we executed on new products first focusing on the service provider space, the high end of the security market where we actually saw some good momentum last year, and we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the product set itself. The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And there are a couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 timeframe. First is we've got hit with a downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those high-end customers. Again, it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict that's going to be somewhat lumpy. And then there were the transitions that we have to deal with in the Q1 timeframe. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise : the SRX1500, the SRX300, and cloud-based ATP solution, an enhanced cloud management systems that I know are all hitting the mark with our customers because we're getting that feedback, but it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out. You're right in stating that last year was supposedly the year of stability \u2013 we ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that timeframe. I think where I might have gotten wrong \u2013 or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. It looks like they're happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to a slow start. So I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on the security side to get back to growth, but I think we were reasonably conservative enough in our long-term outlook, three-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in the 2017 timeframe, that that is still very much achievable. Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to I guess touch on BTI and I know it may be a little bit early, but how conversations have been going there and in that for the data center interconnect opportunity, generally. It seems like this is an important opportunity for Juniper, but also a lot of other players are trying to come into this segment, so I wanted to get your feeling for your development of the confidence there and some of the things that we should be looking for to gauge success of Juniper? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, certainly, James. So the optical opportunity is one that we have been looking at and executing towards now for a number of years. So this certainly did not start with the BTI acquisition. And we're looking at this from the standpoint of capturing inflection points in the market around the convergence of packet and optical. We're also looking at this in terms of achieving the architectures that are necessary in a way that truly simplify the overall operations to management of multilayer networks. And we're certainly focusing on the data center interconnect market and the metro market. What BTI does is that it helps us to accelerate the strategy that we're already executing on towards being able to achieve those architectures. And I feel very good about the opportunity. I also feel good about how we're thoughtfully integrating the BTI assets into our overall portfolio. It is a growing market. It's certainly a competitive market. But I think we have a good stronghold in certain parts of the market today with our MX and PTX product that help us to very naturally capture this inflection point that's happening today. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then I guess just back on the pacing of enterprise and your confidence for the second half of the year, you talked about that there was improvement towards the end of the quarter. Can you just give a little more color as to what types of data points or behaviors that you're looking at to increase the optimism around enterprise after the tough first quarter? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ken, why don't you go ahead? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, this is Ken. Yeah, you got it right. We did see improvement later in the quarter from a demand perspective. From our perspective, the volatility in the market has improved since the beginning of the year. We're still being cautious with the market. It's still a market that has some uncertainty, but it is less uncertain than it was in the beginning of the year. And we did see that in our demand profile. That said, being cautious, we are still modestly \u2013 expecting it to grow modestly from Q1 levels into Q2. So we are expecting an improvement quarter-on-quarter in the enterprise space. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So on these projects in the U.S., that's quite delayed, so I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color about what happened? So is that just like one project, or is that several projects? And what was the cause of the delays? I hope it wasn't because like the Juniper technology wasn't fit for purpose? So is that, like, just logistics or did you have, like, a real technological issue? And if we think about, like, a real issue, do you have better visibility now because you now know the situation is completely cleared up and it's just a question of getting the project to deliver? Or is there still a bit of an uncertainty in terms of resolving reloading issues? And then you sound very confident about these projects coming back into as early as Q2, and I'm actually a bit surprised because when I look at your quarter-on-quarter guidance, it doesn't especially adjust for BTI. It doesn't seem to be much higher than normal seasonality between the Q1 and the Q2 actually in line with normal seasonality. So does that mean you've been prudent in your guide in other areas of the business, or is there another moving part I'm missing? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Pierre, let me start. I think the answer is fairly simple. First it's not just in the U.S., it's a number of telcos, Tier-1 in particular in the U.S. and EMEA. It is not a Juniper-specific thing in any way, and it certainly has nothing to do with fit for purpose as you mentioned in your question. And what gives us more confidence now is that we have better visibility. And certainly, that comes from talking to our customers, understanding what the deployment time frames are going to be. And as I mentioned, just based on where we are right now in the Q2 timeframe, that visibility has improved somewhat from the last few weeks. So that's why we are more confident today. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and I would just add that the service provider business, particularly telecom, has always been lumpy and deployment based. And it is difficult to predict the precise timing of when those large deployments are going to happen. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe on this question about the Q2 guide, so does that mean you had a very prudent approach, or? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We feel \u2013 we stand behind our Q2 guide. It is up over 8% at the midpoint, which is a bit beyond historical patterns. We do expect some of that telecom deployment to start to catch up into Q2 and beyond. We don't expect it to shift all just in one quarter. It will shift into Q2 and beyond Q2. We also expect a modest increase in the enterprise within that guidance increase. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead. Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Hey guys, this is Tejas for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on Web 2.0 companies who were 16% of sales in 2014. Have they trended up or down since then? And then your competitors seem to be targeting the DCI routing market within hyperscalers with Jericho-based products. I was curious how should we think about the impact of those on your hyperscaler revenues? The concern of course is that you'd compress TAM even if you maintain share. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So the cloud providers continue to be a very important and very strategic vertical for us. And I think if you look at their CapEx guidance for the full year, it looks encouraging. We remain very relevant not just in the DCI space, but in many different parts of our web-scale customers' networks. Not confused about the fact that we are going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, it's a very attractive market, and so competition is to be expected. And I would think about it from a couple of different ways. There're sort of different use cases that we go after at Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products like VMX. And the MX has an incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the barriers to entry are just going to be somewhat higher. Then there are more streamlined routing use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing or transport, like the PTX. Nothing new. This is something that we almost invented just a few years ago with the introduction of the PTX product line. And now we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after those streamlined opportunities even more aggressively. And last but not least, there is the introduction of our spine switches that actually opens up a brand new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we are competing effectively for. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and from a numbers perspective, I will say the last time we broke it out, it was 16% back in 2014. We're not prepared to break that out for you now, but I will tell you that it has been our fastest-growing vertical since then. So it is fair to say that it has been trending up as a percentage of our total revenue. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Excuse me. Thank you very much. I am hoping, Rami, that you can help us on the routing side or the service provider side of things. It sounds at one level like you are expecting super seasonal revenue growth through the balance of the year as these projects that got pushed out of the first quarter return over the balance of the year. But at another level, it does sound as though you are a little nervous about the overall demand picture from service providers, with your commentary about the networks running a little hotter as the telcos evaluate their architectures. How do we balance those two? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, thanks Jeff. I don't think actually that we would be expecting something completely out of the normal in terms of telecom spend for second half versus first half. So let me just sort of clarify that. And then, just keep in mind that as we think about the service provider opportunity, that includes telcos, it includes the cloud space, it also includes the cable space. And as I think about that opportunity all up across all of those verticals, and then weave into that our competitiveness with the introduction of new products across the MX and the PTX product lines, that is what essentially gives us the ability to be constructive on the full year. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. All right, so it's broader \u2013 it's broadening your product line \u2013 or broadening your customer base and your new products that are going to do the trick for us here. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's right. I'm not counting on anything that's out of the ordinary in terms of telco seasonality. It's certainly broader across verticals and it includes the new products with our early visibility that we have and the acceptance levels of the new products, the early design wins that we have with the new products that give us that confidence. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Ken, I have a bit of a question for you that might not be totally fair, because it harks back to the last call. But on this call it sounds as though things were kind of bad at the beginning of the quarter and that things picked up over the course of it, partially because of ERP, but also partially because of the end-market. As I recall from the last call, it sounded as though \u2013 at the time of the last call in late-January, you hadn't actually seen stuff or your customers erode their order patterns yet, but you were taking your guidance down a little bit just to be prudent. So that would suggest that things would have gotten worse over the course of the quarter. So could you help us square that away? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter to begin with. So at the time of the call, our visibility into actual results for the Q1 were relatively low, as we'd expect them to be given that point in the quarter and the seasonality or the linearity within the quarter, I should say. That compounded with our ERP transition that we mentioned did really nothing to help our visibility. In fact, we were system down for a few weeks in January. So it was largely as we expected early, but down. But it never came back as quickly as we thought it would. We really thought the pick up from a linearity perspective would happen mid-quarter. It really happened late-quarter. And that's really our traditional pattern, is we start slow and start picking up in the middle, and in this particular quarter, it didn't pick up quite as quickly as we thought it would. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. So all right, that's helpful. Thank you very much, Ken. And congratulations. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Drexel. Please go ahead Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you'd talk a little bit about Lenovo and this partnership. It sounds very interesting. It gives you access to a huge market over there. I know Lenovo is excited about it. Maybe just highlight what you think it means for Juniper, and when can it actually impact the top-line? And second question would be around OpenStack. Obviously there is a big OpenStack summit occurring this week out in Austin, and maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing at OpenStack and how you participate in this conference. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. Lenovo, we, too, are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broad opportunity. It really hinges on the convergence of compute storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a packaged solution that includes all of these elements plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength. And in terms of the timing, I think this is going to take several quarters for us to do what's necessary, both in terms of the technology integration as well as the go-to-market enablement and training that needs to happen to tap into the full opportunity. And again, I am quite excited about the potential for this opportunity. OpenStack, you're right. The conference just took place a short while ago. Juniper just as we have in the past was there in full force with a number of key speaking slots. We're very proud of the fact that our SDN Controller got voted for the third time in a row as the number one deployed SDN Controller worldwide. And we see this firsthand in terms of the telco as well as the large-scale enterprises that we're engaging in with on next-generation automated data center architectures. And we have just a fantastic team, a great product that I'm just very excited about. And in terms of OpenStack itself, and the deployments and the acceptance of OpenStack in the market, we're seeing some increasing interest in customers that want to go down the OpenStack path as opposed to other offerings that are out there. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So I'm going to focus on the OpEx side of the equation here. As we get to the back half of the year, is there potential to see operating margins exceed the numbers you put up last year? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So for us to expand operating margin, which we're committed to doing, and given what we've guided to Q2, yes, you can expect operating margin to exceed on the second half to get to the annualized increase. We will absolutely be managing our OpEx at a lower rate than revenue from a growth perspective. And we're going to be prudent with all levers within OpEx, from headcounts, not head count, et cetera. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right, so then if I were to think about the expense line, are you essentially guiding to decrease in the S&M expense, because I would think that R&D would probably remain stable at the high-teens? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I'm not guiding to decrease OpEx in any particular line. The op margin expansion is very, very correlated to our constructive view on revenue growth for 2016 and will be prudent with OpEx. And that will result in op margin expansion for the full year. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it, thanks. And then just one last one on the security side. I know that it was a little bit of a tough quarter in March, but when do you guys expect to see an inflection point in that business as we work through the year? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so on the security side, we're off to a slow start, as I mentioned primarily because I think there was a macro impact, but there was also the product transition impact. I think the product transitions will work their way out throughout the rest of this year. And I think that our long-term projection for security of 1% to 3% by the end of 2017 remains intact. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I just wanted to ask if you could give us color around the international landscape and what you're hearing about, I guess, growth from European operators. For example, it seems to be, you know, a bit weaker (51:12). Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Victor. So from an international standpoint, in EMEA, the main issue in Q1 was the timing of orders \u2013 or timing of deployments, I should say, in the Q1 timeframe that has moved into Q2 and beyond. There \u2013 we still have visibility into opportunities in the telco space, but also in the large enterprise and government space that I think gives us confidence for the full year in EMEA. And in Asia Pacific, a number of things that are going on there : I think we continue to see good growth outside of China. China remains to be a more challenging environment, but sequentially over the last few quarters, I think China is starting to look more and more encouraging. We have made a number of changes to our go-to-market model, toward leadership in Asia Pacific that's starting to pay off for us. And certainly new partnerships like the one we just discussed with Lenovo are going to help us, I think, in EMEA and Asia Pacific but in particular in Asia Pacific I think we're going to see the benefit there first. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: When you mentioned that your visibility had improved recently, does that include the European operations? Is your visibility comment, you know, reflective of all the geographies, or was that more for the U.S., or \u2013 because it seems that \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I understand the question. And my comments about visibility were specific to the timing of revenue that we had expected in the Q1 timeframe for Tier-1 telcos. And yes, the answer is absolutely, the visibility has now improved for Q2 and beyond for that revenue we had expected in the Q1 timeframe. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah, thank you for taking my question. One of your competitors introduced a solution that's going to combine data center switching and routing based on some of the new chip sets coming out. I'm just curious, is that something that you're looking out with the new QFX, and maybe combining some of that with the MX technologies? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a great question. And certainly the competitive dynamics in our space are evolving and very interesting. However, that said, this idea of routing and switching being combined into a common system is not a particularly new one. The MX, although we have called it a universal edge router for a very long time, has actually enjoyed many switching capabilities for many years. Our PTX product line runs the same operating system as the MX product line, and it, too, combines routing and switching in a very streamlined transport type of manner. And our QFX product line, both the top of rack as well as the new QFX10000 that we're introducing into the market are going to enjoy not just a great switching capability, but all of the benefits of fantastic routing that comes from the fact that we have a common operating system. Our one operating system strategy in the company is really going to shine as we start to deploy cloud solutions that include switching, routing, security, and the orchestration software, where the combination of switching and routing is going to help us compete very effectively in this use case. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : So is that going to be part of the strategy, consolidating those two layers within the data center? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it depends because it very much is going to depend on the type of solution that the customer wants. In certain cases, one can think of an architecture where the edge of the data center will do nothing more than provide a transport function that connects to another data center \u2013 very simple use case. In that case, we've already been going after that opportunity with our PTX product line, and we certainly have the ability to go after that opportunity with the QFX10000 switches. But there are, not to be underestimated, many customers that require a lot of complex encapsulations and decapsulations, complex routing functions that require a great deal of flexibility right down to the hardware, that can only be captured with a class of product like the MX. The key points here for us is we have the most complete portfolio of tools at our disposal right now between the MX, the PTX and the QFX to compete very effectively, irrespective of what the architectural approach that our customers have in mind. And that holds true for any of our competitors in the market. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, and second question, did you see any change on the competitive landscape? I understand timing \u2013 specifically I'm thinking of security. Some of the other vendors that have reported had relatively good high-end sales in the quarter. I'm just wondering did you see any emerging players or anything change on the competitive landscape in the market? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the high end of our security space, I think we have a very competitive product geared towards the large cloud providers that need a lot of performance at the edge of a data center as well as in the service provider space for mobile connectivity in particular, what we call the Gi-LAN firewall. I don't think that things got more competitive in the Q1 timeframe. I think the issue that we faced in Q1 timeframe were mostly the combination of macro factors (57:25) resulted in a slow start, the product transitions and the lumpiness in our large service provider business. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Erik. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations : So that is \u2013 thank you, Manny. That is all the time we have today. I'd like to thank all of the analysts for your great questions, insightful as always. And also a reminder that we're looking forward to seeing many of you either in person or via webcast at our upcoming Investor Day in New York City on May 17. So that is all the time we have.

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016, as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1.221 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year over year, and 4% sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points, and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%, operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I'm proud of the disciplined execution from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term targets. I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on two important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovations. On the dimension of automation, we believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed service providers alike to deliver on-demand cloud services seamlessly. A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. In both the Enterprise and Service Provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. For example, a Tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its energy (4:52) platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking applications, but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services, such as real time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. Similarly, we have also been in production for over a year now with a large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization, and offer their enterprise customers best of breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions. Some great examples of our momentum include Verizon, which selected our cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN controller for its easy go network as a service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. The scale and performance of Routing, Switching and Security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth, and trying to do so economically. Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company, with the breakthrough products like the M40, the MX and the PTX that over the years have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth intensive applications continue to soar, and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time. And we also believe there is still plenty of room for that innovation both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks. Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is as big if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful open lab program with six new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technologies. Now, moving on, I'd like to comment on our Routing, Switching, and Security business this quarter. In Routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals, and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year over year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco, and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10 gig to 100 gig connections, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and Edge Network layers gives us a clear, competitive advantage to gain market share. In Switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting, and enterprise customers. Our QFX 10,000 family of spine switches is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. In Security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transitions are going to take time to play out, and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain-level solutions for the cloud, SB mobile, and enterprise networks that include elements of Routing, Switching, and Security all working tightly together. We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control, and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solutions, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability, while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking needs. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth, while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focus on managing our business prudently, while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. Now, I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results reflect strong sequential revenue and earnings growth. Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service Provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong, with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was in Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1.0, and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year, and up $182 million sequentially. We repurchased $126 million of shares, and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 0.7% sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure, primarily in EMEA, as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly, relative to the full year of 2015. We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. . And our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good evening, and thank you for taking my question. I'd like to focus, of course, on the gross margin surprise which we saw in the quarter and what you're planning for coming quarters. So, you mentioned mix and pricing pressure. On the latter, I'd like to know where the pricing pressure is coming from. Are you suffering from currency? Are you forced to give discounts to secure business with clients to \u2013 who are having a harder time defending their budgets? Or are you actually facing competitors with more aggressive pricing? And then on the former, on the mix shift, if you could give us a bit of color on what kind of mix, what are like the higher margin products that are less in the mix today and what are the lower margin products that are more in the mix today? That would be great. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Pierre. I'll start and then I'll pass it on to Ken to provide some additional details. With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So, something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker Euro, additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. And then there is, yes, this secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say two additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker than expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So, I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team and you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing into the market now, one of the things that we've always focused on and we will continue to focus on is the innovation that goes into reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second \u2013 of Routing, Switching, and Security. And I view that as something that would be helpful certainly as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great, yeah. Rami, I think you covered the elevated pricing pressure in EMEA pretty well. I'll touch on the product mix. So, an example of that that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Although we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight negative impact to both gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. The \u2013 an example \u2013 the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, there's a lot of different product mix contributors whether it be chassis versus line cards, our percentage of software. So, product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point I think it's \u2013 we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%. We're focused on delivering innovation and continuing our cost structure improvements and we'll go forward from here. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Now our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. I was hoping you could help us understand how much the improvement in the Switching business was driven by the uptake of the new QFX 10K platforms and which verticals you're seeing the greatest demand for these products. And then, to what degree you'd expect to see uptake of the 10K drive further sequential improvement as we move to the second half of the year? And then I have a follow-up. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks, Jess, for the question. So, needless to say, we're really pleased with the performance of our Switching business all up in Q2. We saw double-digit growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, strength in telcos, in cloud, and especially Q2 we saw a strong government sector as well, play out for us nicely. We have said consistently that the new products \u2013 the spine switches, the 10K switches \u2013 are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There's certainly some orders and early revenue that came in in Q2 timeframe, but right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end Switching portfolio. Last thing I'll just say is there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space, as our customers go from 10gig and 40gig to 25gig and 100gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high performance problems that I think Juniper loves to solve. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then Rami, I was hoping you could touch on the potential impact from Jericho-based Routing products, particularly in the cloud vertical and perhaps to what extent you view more advanced Layer 3 switches is a threat to your Edge Routing business, and should we expect you guys to more directly address this market later this year or next? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, certainly it's a question that has come up. I think at the end of the day, the thing that matters the most to our customers, across all verticals, including the cloud vertical, are the capabilities of the products and the solutions themselves \u2013 from the standpoint of flexibility, Layer 3 stack capabilities, the density in performance, the price per port, et cetera. And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, I sort of categorized the market in three distinct buckets. There are those that care about very flexible Routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport \u2013 wide area network transport efficiency; and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to Switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all three of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now, going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology, and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors, and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that what we can do internally, and that's exactly what we're doing right now. So, net-net this is a competitive industry; we've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks, Jess. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Kesireddy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Rami, I just want to go back to the discussion around pricing pressure. I was just wondering if this pricing pressure is more concentrated on sell-in customers, and whether we could expect a recovery there any time soon. And also, just going back to your 2016 full year revenue outlook, I think on the last conference call, you said you were constructive on revenue growth, and now it looks like \u2013 it sounded to me like you are turning down a little bit. I was just wondering what has changed in the last three months. Exiting Q1, I thought things were getting better and now, clearly there's a change in tone. Any more color you can give there would be really helpful. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me start and I'll see if Ken wants to weigh in on this. With respect to the comments about pricing, there are no clear patterns in terms of specific customers with the exception of just saying that it's mostly focused in the EMEA region and it's mostly a result of things like foreign exchange. We're not calling this a new normal in terms of gross margins. I think there are a number of things that we can do to improve things going forward; but in the meantime, we're going to be very prudent in how we manage the business, control operating expenses, and so on. And then from a revenue standpoint, actually, what we said is that we remain constructive on the full year from a revenue standpoint, 2016 versus 2015. Where we're being a bit more cautious is on our operating margins and that's primarily as a result of the gross margin impact that we're seeing in Q2 \u2013 that we saw in Q2. But we'll continue to manage the business very prudently to protect operating margins to the extent that we can. Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question ma'am. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Balaji Krishnamurthy calling on her behalf. I have two questions. The first one on the Routing business, you mentioned that you saw a (24:38) decline in that business in the U.S. cloud providers segment. What drove the weakness there? And then on the Security business, maybe just to back up a little bit. So, since you refreshed SRX last year, you saw some strong growth through the remaining part of 2015, but it's now again fallen off in the first two quarters. So what kind of visibility do you have in terms of recovery for that vertical, and is it through the existing portfolio, or would you be adding more products into the portfolio? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, thanks Balaji for the questions. On the Routing, I think that we actually are encouraged by what we've seen in Routing in terms of the sequential improvement from the Q1 standpoint. And we really saw this across all geos, so that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if you look at the Routing opportunity \u2013 oh, the last thing \u2013 the second thing I would say about Routing is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to Routing. So, that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to Routing. Certainly, there is a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our Routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider networks. And I think that should start in the second half of the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message. I think if I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international for our Routing products. That includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos in particular for the second half remain somewhat challenging. I think on the Enterprise side, we saw good, very good in fact, sequential recovery in Q2. That was across Switching and Routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So, I think there's actually quite a lot of good things happening from a Routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities, as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken, there was a secondary question about Security. So, Security sequentially up over Q1, but certainly nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is the business that is right now in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that, it's \u2013 this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations, and it was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high bandwidth Security applications. That's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus, and the one that we're actually giving the attention focus to today is on the Enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers, on the roadmap, on the products that we have introduced thus far, is very encouraging, but there is still a ton of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year, and I expect the growth to happen next year. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. All the best. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, this is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. In the past we've talked about RFP activity increasing, particularly in Switching and Security, and it looks like we're starting to see that pay off for Switching. But can you just talk about what it's going to take to get to that next level in Security and just getting you through that transition period that you just mentioned? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks for the question, Dan. What it's going to take is more execution on our part, and a bit of time, to be honest. The Security space is a very competitive space. The thing that I think Juniper can leverage to our advantage is the fact that we're really thinking about it from a solutions standpoint. So as we go to our customers and help them build out a private cloud data center or a hybrid cloud data center, or things like on-premises cloud CPE solutions, there is a Security element to each and every one of those solutions. So, we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and, of course, then positioning Security along with the Routing and Switching. So, I think that's playing out already quite nicely in the cloud side. From an Enterprise standpoint, Enterprise campus, and so on, there is still some more features to develop, new hardware to release into the market, to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the Security space. And I think next year is the year where we'll have enough critical mass to start seeing a recovery in the business. Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up on the Security \u2013 sorry, sort of three in a row \u2013 but how much this year do you think is being complicated, or trying to get the Security business right-footed and prepared to return to growth, is being complicated by some of the publicity around vulnerabilities in previous Juniper generations, et cetera? Is that having much of an impact? And I guess my second part of the question is in terms of future business development. How should we think about changes or how you address the changes in relationships with Nokia and Ericsson? Is that part of the competitive pressure that you're feeling in EMEA? Thanks a lot. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks for the question, James. On the Security side, the vulnerability that you discussed is at this point largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy screen OS Security products, and made sure that there is no such effect on the \u2013 and we in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Juno side. We were open with our customers, and I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers in how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effect. Right now, I think the main issue with Security is, there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technologies we need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunities that exist. Right now, we're competitive, but in specific areas and use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in Security. That's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. In Security, the thing you should notice, as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with Switching and Routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we put into Switching and Routing also contributes to our Security product portfolio. On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think, with both of these customers \u2013 or these partners \u2013 we have talked about how the volume of business it's still relatively a small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced and that's primarily because Juniper has been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have over the years been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume of business that's large enough, as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I'm not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please proceed. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to the sort of the top line. And I know several questions have been asked, but I want to sort of get a sense of how you guys are thinking in the back half of the year. And could Security, given clearly, being a headwind here, could that potentially be down 25% \u2013 20%, 25% \u2013 this year? And if that is the case, and you are planning for top line to be up slightly \u2013 so, let's assume it's up maybe 1% \u2013 that gives you a bit of a tough ramp in the Q4 timeframe of modeling somewhere in the 5.5%, 6%, maybe 6.5% range. So, what are sort of the ebbs and flows \u2013 given that Security is down \u2013 do you expect the Switching to kind of contribute, the Routing to contribute? And is Security really going to be down that much in that 20%, 25% range decline? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can you give us a little bit of how to think about Q4? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I got the question and I appreciate it. I think, look to the example of Q2. Security, year-over-year, was down pretty significantly, but despite that we came in at the high end of our range for revenue. I think when we provide the constructive view of 2016 all-up, we're certainly factoring in what we expect from Switching, Routing and Security. Security is going to be a headwind. Keep in mind that the new products that are in the market now at standard lead times, where we're competing for opportunities worldwide, are mostly in the area of Routing and in Switching. And I think this is where we have the confidence that that part of the business is going to perform sufficiently to offset weakness and headwinds in Security. Anything else, Ken? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, just to talk a little bit about the numbers. So to your point, the first half results was about 1% up year-on-year, half-on-half. Q3 at the midpoint of guidance is flat year-on-year at the midpoint. We're not giving Q4 guidance, but I do think we're constructive on our Q4 ability to grow sequentially, primarily because of the strength in new products and some of the other factors that Rami's mentioned. That gets us to our modest growth for the year. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, and then my follow-up, if I look at the sort of geo splits, it sounds \u2013 most of the upside, I mean, you've seen it across all regions, that's fair \u2013 but most of the upside seems to have come from the APAC side of the equation. So, can you just fill in and talk about that and what's driving that? Is the partnerships with NEC or Lenovo or anybody else out there that you're seeing the uptick in revenue from? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's actually a great question. I am extremely proud of how our team in Asia-Pacific is executing right now. Around a year, year and a half ago or so, we made some changes in that region from a leadership standpoint. From a structural standpoint, we've refocused on parts of the APAC market that we believe are first growing, second, we are best equipped to support. We have activated partnerships that are helping us in Japan. We are in the process of activating a partnership with Lenovo, as we have announced historically, that will help us in worldwide but especially in APAC and especially in China. And looking out, I think the opportunity there for further momentum and growth are there. It's still a fairly challenging market for a variety of reasons, but with solid execution, we've now have had several quarters of performance, and again, very proud of the team. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe a quick one to Ken on the BTI. What was the revenue in the quarter from BTI? Just a housekeeping question there. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so we're not going to break it out specifically, but we did guide to $10 million to $15 million for the quarter, and it came in in line with our expectations. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, this is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the progression of the ERP system and when the impact you believe is going to start to produce a productivity improvement and efficiencies moving forward. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that question. So, it's a good question. So, the way I describe it, clearly Q1 was the period of ramp; Q2 was largely the period of stability. We've made a lot of progress in Q2 on our processes and streamlining those processes. We still have a little \u2013 a few areas to still improvement upon \u2013 but for the most part the ERP stability is there. I would say, you didn't ask about DSO but some of those stability factors in invoicing did cause a few days of DSO to be higher than expected so DSO came in at 55. If you were to normalize for ERP activity, I think we'd be closer to the 50 range. But from a going forward, you're absolutely right, the focus for the second half and for next year is on value creation and optimization, leveraging the new system we have in place, and really streamlining our operation. So that is absolutely yet to come and something we're very focused on. Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I'm calling on behalf of Steve. I was hoping to get an update on the campus Switching business. Was it down year-over-year and do you foresee the new EX series helping the business return to growth? And I was also curious if you're seeing increased competitive pressures from most of your competitors having a wireless LAN business. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me take that. Just net-net, I'd say the business was probably more flattish if you look at campus Switching specifically. But let me just qualify this a bit. We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is, and where we can differentiate the most in the Switching area. And that is in Enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public cloud. And that's why we've seen our Switching business perform really well. We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on-ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right, so we can work effectively with our wireless partners in going after that opportunity. So, I think that if you consider all that, a flattish Switching performance for campus is something that I'm actually okay with. Overall, I think the Switching business is growing, and that's a result of the deliberate strategy and the focus that we've had as a company and I think that's a very good thing. Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : And as a follow-up, can I get an update on the Lenovo partnership? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Certainly, yeah. So this is \u2013 it's still right now in the early stages in terms of putting in place the mechanics of how we're going to go after our customers worldwide, the partners and the channels that we need to work through and agree on, and also the technology integration that we are going to execute on to make sure that we provide compelling solutions to our customers. So, I think we've said historically that we don't anticipate meaningful contribution this year, and that remains the case. I think where this is going to start to benefit both Juniper and Lenovo is next year. I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunity in working with Lenovo. As you know, there's a large part of the market that is interested in converged stack architectures and having really compelling servers, storage, and networking working tightly together is something that I think is going to be helpful to our business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to kind of walk through three time periods to understand gross margin issues. So first of all, in the near term, you talked about challenges in the EMEA region, but it doesn't look to me that we've seen all that much movement during the June quarter of the Euro-to-dollar exchange rate, pre- the Brexit vote. So I'm just wondering whether this was an issue where it had been building up for some time and a competitor who sells in euros, basically you concluded you had to respond that things wouldn't move back in your favor. And then when we look out to 2017, I think most of us expect you'll face a new competitor in Routing, particularly in the data center. And we're wondering how that competitive dynamic could play out with a new entrant that sounds like they will be somewhat aggressive on pricing. And then looking out even further, the last part of this gross margin trend, is when does the software business, the Contrail and NorthStar products, when do they become material enough to be a tailwind to gross margin? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, great set of questions. Let me start, and maybe I'll start with more of the 2017 competitive question that you have. First, I would say that this is not \u2013 that competitive issue around new entrants into the market introducing the sort of Routing capabilities and so forth \u2013 that's not the issue that we're seeing in the Q3 and the Q2 timeframe. Are we anticipating that this industry is going to be \u2013 continue to be competitive? Absolutely, which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those three different use cases that I mentioned just previously, around rich Routing, lean Routing and Switching, and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know, the innovations and the technology that we're developing in the company, the plans that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that that can be done. I think from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 timeframe, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services. A lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software, and I think that certainly helps us from a gross margin standpoint. I'll let Ken talk some more to that. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'll touch on the first and the third one. From a U.S. dollar strengthening, you're absolutely right, this really isn't related to a Q2 specific change in foreign currencies. It's more of the buildup over the last few quarters over the strengthening dollar, and the fact it's starting to have an impact on our customer budgets and their ability to purchase our equipment. So it's really more of the long-term buildup of the FX concerns, or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I should say. From a software \u2013 Rami's right \u2013 the 45% was our long-term model of services and software. Just to level set those, we're at about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that, and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable, software stand alone would be 3% today, to 15% to 20% by 2019 and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today. We talk about product mix. There are headwinds; there are tailwinds. Albeit, it's a relatively small percentage of our revenue, it's a growing percentage and every incremental dollar in software does help us on the gross margin line. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, that's really very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, in terms of the gross margin getting back to that 64% metric, I would think that the opticals business that you guys purchased with BTI would see sequential growth throughout the year. And then in addition, if we assume there's no change in the FX dynamic, are you going to be able to get to 64% margin if you're doing $1.3 billion in revenue? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so our current visibility from Q3 is reflected in the guidance we gave, which is 63%. So again, in line with Q2, primarily because some of the factors that developed in Q2, we see in Q3 as well. For the longer term, we're not giving Q4 guidance, but I think it's safe to expect some sequential improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in Q4. That's really our historic pattern and I would expect to drive to that in Q4 as well. We're clearly not giving up on the 64% operating model. We're working on cost innovation, cost improvements, cost structure, as well as product innovation, I should say, and making sure we sell the value of that. From a BTI perspective, I do expect BTI to ramp, and it does have a slight impact to gross margin percentage. However, I would state that the first quarter of ramp we did have some startup costs, et cetera, that as BTI scales, it will become more margin favorable than it is today as we go forward. Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me \u2013 an additional thing I'd like to add on the optical side as a reminder \u2013 is that we're not after building a stand-alone optical business. I think the world has enough optical technology providers. What we're out to do is to really capture an inflection point in the market around packet optical solutions that include the packet layers, the optical layers, and also very importantly, the software layers that tie all of these together. So, we're playing much more of a disruptive game in the optical space as it pertains to packet integration. You might have seen the news around Juniper joining the Telecom Infra Project with Facebook and Microsoft and others. The whole idea is to develop open, interoperable solutions in the networking domain around packet optical that I think will benefit us in the long term. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, a quick housekeeping question, and then a real question. Can you remind me what percentage of total revenue was cloud providers? And I hate to ask about gross margins yet again \u2013 I recognize this is the fourth time on this call \u2013 but going through the math, I'm still confused with the simple question being how much of this is secular versus how much is transitory. EMEA was down as a percentage of total revenue in both 1Q and 2Q versus last year, and that was about 1.5 to 4 percentage points. I recognize some of that is the lower pricing impacting revenues. But your product gross margin was down almost one percentage point sequentially following 100 basis point to over 200 basis point decline in the first quarter from calendar 2015 levels, and the quarter represents an all-time low. And I'm not trying to give you a hard time, I'm just trying to understand, how much of this is secular? How much of it is transitory? The FX was an issue throughout last year as well, for that matter. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so we really did not experience much in the way of FX-related pricing pressure last year. We started to experience a little bit of it in Q4 of last year, but quite honestly the elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2 was new to us, right? It hit us stronger than it has in the past. It's always been a very competitive environment, and we've been able to deal with that, and we expect to be able to deal with that going forward, but the Q2 pricing pressure, particularly in EMEA, was acute this quarter and that is new. The other impact, we talked about pricing pressure as well as margin. We're not breaking out exact math, but they had both roughly an equal impact to the call it traditional 64%, or our long-term model of 64% versus the 63% result. Product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it cost us a couple tenths and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there, we can fill with line cards (51:25). We're transforming the company to more of a software stream (51:43), so we're very focused on recouping the margins that we lost in Q2, and are not coming off our long-term model. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: On the pricing pressure, and if you said I apologize, but was that across the board in EMEA? Was it certain product markets more prevalent, certain customer markets? Can you give us any insight? And again, if you can share with us the percentage of revenue from cloud providers. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so the cloud providers, I'll touch on that because I forgot last time. Sorry about that. In FY 2015 we talked about it being \u2013 2016 \u2013 being 19% of the total revenue and obviously our fastest growing vertical, it gets us to nearer 25% by 2019. So that's a reminder of the cloud vertical. From a pricing and where it happened, it was really more geographic and customer-specific, I would say, than just a broad base. We did see pressure globally. I think the macro environment as it relates to this geopolitical issues, et cetera, are kind of being different in every geo, but we are seeing a bit of global pressure but really specific to EMEA and specific to certain geographies in EMEA. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is it Enterprise, Service Provider, both? Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's both. I would not say it's a customer vertical specific situation. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Baird. Please proceed. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great, thank you. Rami, I wanted to follow up on your prepared remarks around CEB, the cloud-enabled brand solution, and maybe to start your broader perspective on SD-WAN, the pace of adoption as you see it in the market, and you outlined some opportunities. Is this also a revenue headwind for the category as corporates shift away from expensive MPOS interconnects? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks for the question, Jason. I think actually, the cloud-enabled branch solutions that we're developing are in fact a potential tailwind for us. So, as I have mentioned with respect to the telco space, and them moving, changing their architectures and moving to much more of an agile scale-out service delivery model, we want to make sure that we are in the middle of this architectural transformation that's happening. So that once they start to prove out the model and to make revenue \u2013 and to start growing their virtualized solution business, that we benefit from that. And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we are in many cases in pole position in working and developing these solutions for our customers. I know SD-WAN is sort of a very big topic these days. I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers, in developing very effective, agile, cost-competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the stand-alone point player SD-WAN players that are out there. That's what we're doing, and I think that's our best strategy considering the relationships we have with our telcos and also the technology that we've developed for them. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And Rami, pace of adoption, SDN's been somewhat slow. Is this going to happen more quickly? Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: SDN is such a broad term. If you look at SDN as it pertains to the cloud virtualization, cloud orchestration, there I'm pleased with the pace of adoption, the win rate, even if revenue is still relatively small compared to our overall revenue of the company for Contrail. What I like about it is it's a very strategic part of every sale, every engagement. It's almost entirely subscription-based recurring revenue and it's setting ourselves up for selling virtualized Security, virtualized Routing, et cetera, in the future. I think that part is moving according to plan. As far as these new cloud-enabled brand solutions, a lot of it was going to depend on the success of the telcos in making those services successful to their end customers, in particular the enterprise customers. So, we're helping them do that because we recognize that if we help them do that, and they grow that business, we will be able to grow a brand new revenue stream for the company, and that's something that I'm very excited about. I don't think it's going to happen meaningfully this year, but I'm hopeful that it'll start to contribute in a meaningful way next year. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay, our final question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Please proceed. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on the pricing. Can you comment about pricing in the Security sector in particular? You had a competitor this morning also note some pricing pressure in that sector. Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so we saw pricing pressure really in all technologies. However, Security \u2013 definitely not immune from that \u2013 so we did see some pricing pressure in Security. But again, our strongest correlation was more geographic really than it was product related. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen... Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations : Okay, well, that ends... Operator : I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kathleen. Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations : No, no, no go ahead, Chris. I was going to say the same thing. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today. And I just wanted to thank everyone for your great questions as always and look forward to talking with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today and we thank you for your time and participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful rest of the day.",

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth. Thank you. You may begin. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial condition and operating results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K today and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time-to-time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks Kathleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1.285 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. I've said before that I believe we have a great strategy in place to be a pure-play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across Routing, Switching and Security. We are pleased to see our Routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter and along with our MX platform, they are proving be our customers' preferred choices for their core and Edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. I'm very pleased with our strong performance in Switching, where we saw continued growth in the data center and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as from large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past three years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our Switching business in the future. Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. Earlier this month, at our Annual Customer Event NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our Security portfolio, extending our software-defined secured network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivered deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new mid-range firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200 that are optimized for hybrid clouds environment. Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiencies. At Investor Day earlier this year we stated we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive in the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees, who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results of the September quarter reflect solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies. And we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud or cable providers, four were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-build greater than one and an increase in product deferred revenue up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4.60 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion. And we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. Now moving onto Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q3 levels in the near-term. On a full year basis at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. I want to squeeze two in. First, for Rami, it sounds like you saw really good traction for the QFX lineup. I was hoping you could help us understand which of these models have been driving the strength, if there were any large deals here, or if it was more broad-based? And perhaps to what degree do you see this lineup competing for routing opportunities versus Jericho-based alternatives, and what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement. As volumes picked up in Q4, we could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressure still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal, or do you still think we can see some improvement next year? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Jess, thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching question, and then I'll pass it over to Ken to talk about gross margins. So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 timeframe. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us. And you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the QFX10002, the QFX10008 and the upcoming QFX10016 are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So what we're \u2013 we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera, that we quite frankly just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out a portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration System, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're I think leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose, but I will say this. Every decision we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom, in certain cases, we're going to use merchant, and that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmaps across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured, I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing which is around routing. The data center problem is in fact a high performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Great. So on the gross margin question, Jess, yeah, the Q2 results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market though. I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63% not only for Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations in our gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64%. I'm sorry, 63%. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks guys. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay, and thank you. Before we continue with the Q&A, let's try to keep it to one question you guys, as much as you can. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, everybody. Thank you for take the question. I had like a very long list of questions. Now, I'll have to pick one. I'm sorry for that. Maybe I'll pick a fairly specific one, that's on your QFX product line. So my assumption is that (16:03) is a lot of your success with your cloud clients at the moment. And my other assumption is that what you've been able to bring to the market in terms telemetry and the quality of your telemetry features have weighted a lot in your commercial success. And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitors in that segment, brought up new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the coming two or three quarters with a competitor getting closer to you, at least on that dimension? And could that inflect a bit your commercial success there? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Pierre, for the question. First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad based than just the large cloud providers. I think there are \u2013 it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also in fact, in some teleco opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in Switching, there are very different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically when people hear the word scale they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that. It's also around the number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our product that give us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high performance, high scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast, and that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at the switching and the cloud opportunity, is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching, in data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comings from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Simona. I was wondering if you could touch on the geographical trends, especially with Europe? You had a few quarters of declines there on a one-on-one basis. Where do you see a turn in that market? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me start, and maybe Ken has some more color to add. First, I think we saw good momentum up year-over-year, 5% in the Americas. We also saw sequential growth in the Americas as well. That was driven largely by cloud providers, by cable operators and also by large enterprises. So we're very pleased with the performance there. EMEA sequentially was actually quite healthy, and it's driven \u2013 our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now, there's certainly some factors in EMEA that we're keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular. And we're even seeing good sequential growth in China with the partnerships that we've announced there and with our product portfolio that's actually working quite well for us over there. Anything you want to add, Ken? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, I mean, I'd just reiterate. EMEA was the one geography that was down year-on-year, as you noted. I think it is a challenging marketplace there. There's a lot going on. We're clearly staying as close to the market situation as we can. And I would say because of the macro uncertainties, it has a propensity to be a little more choppy than normal, right? We are pretty concentrated on telco, as Rami mentioned, so as the telcos go, as some of the big deployments happen, you might see revenue fluctuate a little more in that geography going forward as some of the others. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. I want to compare the opportunity in telcos versus cloud, and take a more maybe of a long-term view. So if the pending in telcos, if it continues to decline, is your participation in the cloud opportunity big enough or large enough to offset this? And maybe you can talk about your participation among cloud providers, what kind of products and projects \u2013 conceptually, what kind of projects and products you're working on? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that the cloud opportunity remains robust for the foreseeable future. I mean, at the end of this year and I think into next year, large cloud providers and as well as the second tier cloud providers that are what we call Born in the Cloud, their business models evolved around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telco is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they've spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer-term in telcos, all service providers \u2013 or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy a very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio of switching, routing, security and very much around our cloud software, Contrail being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening at our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for \u2013 because of this transformation that's happening, telcos we can expect will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their Edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in the transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of buildouts that they will be deploying. And I think that will start in the 2017 timeframe. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. A genuine clarification first, and then the question. You were kind enough to give us some detail on the Top 10 customers showing some good balance. I wasn't quite sure where the cloud providers, the Googles, Amazons, Facebooks, whether you consider those service providers or enterprises in your discussion of customers. So just a clarification on that. And then in terms of the trend, you've talked about the web scale cloud providers being a high teens percent of revenue in the last couple of quarters. Just wondering where you stand today with that group? And how you see that group as a percent of sales longer term as you look out into 2017? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the clarification, so those customers you mentioned would be part of our cloud vertical, which roll up into the service provider market if you will. So just to clarify that. That's where they stand. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a vertical perspective, we talked a bit about \u2013 Rami just talked about the cloud vertical and its robustness going forward. And just to remind folks what we talked about at Investor Day. We expect that to be double-digit growth over the next three-year period, 10% to 13% CAGR. Right now, last year FY 2015, the cloud vertical represented about 19% of our total revenue. Clearly it's going be our fastest growing vertical over the next few years. So it will continue to take more percentage of our total revenue. And we expect it to get to approximately 24% by 2019. So it will be a bigger piece of our revenue going forward. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. I actually had kind of a follow-up to a previous question. And that is if I look at the commentary, you guys had mentioned QFX had done real well. Data center cloud had done real well. But if I look at the relative stress and width quarter-over-quarter where the revenue came from, it came mostly from the routing side. And I think from the commentary where the cloud guys sit, they sit in the service provider I think what you said. That vertical was actually down by about $35 million versus Enterprise that was up $58 million quarter-over-quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile the strength there, whether that's really the PTX or is something else? Can you help us reconcile the difference? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not sure I'm following your math precisely, so I apologize for that. We could follow-up. But I would say that from a year-on-year perspective, Switching led by QFX was our strongest growing technology. Switching was up 10%. Routing was up 3%. In absolute dollars, Routing continues to be our largest technology. So in absolute dollars, they're more similar in growth year-on-year. The sequential growth was predominantly routing in absolute dollars but again, pretty broad based and consistent across technologies. Routing was up 8%. Switching was up 6%, and Security was up 9%. So I'm not sure I answered your question, but I'd be glad to follow up with you with more details. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you. I was referring on the sequential basis, strictly where the relative strength came from. And it seems it had come from routing. That's \u2013 and then the enterprise was also pretty strong relatively speaking from quarter-over-quarter. So that's why I was just trying to reconcile those two. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so, you're right. Routing was up 8% quarter-on-quarter. Switching was up 6%. We did have a pretty strong switching quarter in Q2. And we have seen strength in Enterprise on a sequential basis since the Q1 lows, right? So we had a pretty strong Q2 sequentially and Q3 sequentially. However, Enterprise is still down slightly year-on-year. So the macro and some of the transition impacts that really affected us in Q1 are starting to subside, and we're starting to return to growth on the Enterprise segment. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can I just follow-up on one thing, the PTX side of things. Can you give us a little \u2013 can you qualify what the revenue percent of total? Or percent of routing? Or what the growth in that segment was as you did for QFX, just so that we can calibrate around it? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not going to break it out, but I will give you a qualitative view. The PTX did very well. It had a record quarter. When we developed and released the PTX into the market, we had a thesis around how telcos and cloud providers are going be thinking about the evolution of their wide area networks, the data center interconnect networks. And while it has taken us some time to convince our customers and to help them in making the architectural transition towards those lean core networks or the super-core networks that we called them, what we're seeing right now is exactly what we had expected and hoped for, which is a real acceptance, and in fact, enthusiasm for these sorts of super core, lean-core architecture that are driving the PTX business. So very pleased with the PTX growth thus far. We have a highly differentiated core product in the PTX after the introduction of the new line cards for that platform in the first half of this year. And I am bullish about the growth of the PTX going forward as well. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. We know that Juniper's having success with next-gen solutions like Contrail and with virtual routing and CPE deployments at both AT&T and Verizon, and that the goal you guys announced is for 45% of revenue to come from software and services in 2019. Are you still tracking with these plans? And how have deployments changed versus when you \u2013 what you may have expected when you originally announced those plans? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. So you're absolutely right in that Contrail continues to see more and more interest, more and more adoption, especially with the open stack, but not exclusively the open stack community. And more and more, for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes container-type of solutions, for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined-networking element, to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar Wide Area SDN controller. There is the virtual network function and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE Solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investments that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our disaggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security, and routing to an extent is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is in fact in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years get to our target. What you're e going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal. We're working very aggressively towards it. Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much for taking my question. Rami, kind of a follow-up question to that is as carriers undertake this network transformation you're talking, how are you navigating change in partnerships, et cetera, to provide those carrier customers with the technology knowhow and ability to \u2013 or helping them with their transition from a services perspective? And I guess tied into that, just an OpEx question. You've been running OpEx a little bit lower than your target, at least as a percent of revenue. Do you see room for further cuts in OpEx going forward? Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Let me touch on the partnership question. I'm sure Ken would want to weigh in on the OpEx piece. So we see this in a number of different ways. Partners are extremely important for us in going after broader teleco opportunities. And yes, when it comes to some of these new cloud architectures that telcos are adopting, there are elements of the solution that we count on partners for, in particular, for example, around the OSS/BSS, the integration into their existing OSS/BSS systems and so forth. And here we've got fantastic partnerships with companies like NEC, IBM and Amdocs that essentially enables us to provide those end-to-end solutions. Having said that, however, in every one of these large teleco transformations, we have a very direct interface to the customer, and in some cases we find that the way in which we need to grow our business, our relevance, is by taking the customer from an indirect relationship, fulfillment relationship to a direct one. And we've done that gradually around the world on an as-needed basis. The bottom line is I feel very good about our ability today to take the innovation that we produce in-house and to combine it with that of partners and to reach our customers around the globe through the go-to market capabilities of our partners. On OpEx, I'll let Ken. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Sure. So I'm particularly proud of our OpEx results this quarter, $494 million. We came in below the low point of our guidance range. And that is with an Aurrion, which was an acquisition we closed during the quarter that wasn't factored into our guidance. So we did a great job controlling our costs this quarter. And you can count on us to continuing to do that going forward, particularly in light of some of the macro challenges we're experiencing in the gross margin line as an example. We're doing everything we can to make sure we maximize shareholder returns and shareholder value and really managing OpEx tightly, making sure we grow and expand our earnings as we move forward in these marketing conditions. So it's something you can count on us continuing to do as we move forward. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. This is Justin on for Jim. Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment on any update wins you had for Contrail? And also, if you could just maybe comment in terms of the demand and what the pipeline looks like? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the Contrail question. I think it's fair to say that the adoption rate of Contrail is tracking really well. We have at least a half a dozen new logos that we scored just in this last quarter. And these are meaningful, large either cloud providers or service providers, telcos. We're seeing especially good strength with the telcos as they undertake this cloud transformation within their own networks. And I expect there to be more success going forward. A really important element of the Contrail success that we're seeing is in each and every one of the \u2013 I'd say most of the deployments that we've had thus far, it has led to pull-through opportunities, where we can now bundle a portfolio of switching, routing, security into the Contrail solution that we're offering to our customers. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add, Rami, is it also typically comes with some professional services engagement as well, which is very \u2013 becoming more and more strategic to our overall solution sale. And last but not least the Contrail revenue will be slower and gradual as it comes to the subscription nature of the revenue. So, some of our deferred revenue growth is Contrail and some of our other software products. Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. This is Tejas on for Steve. When I look at sequential routing growth in 4Q over the last few years, it's been up in certain years and down in certain years. But as we look into 4Q this year, is it fair to assume that it will grow similar to last year, given the CapEx trends you talked about earlier? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I would expect both in Q2 and Q3 of this year we saw sequential growth across all technologies. I believe we're going to have a similar result in Q4. I do think we'll see some growth across many of the new products and all three of the technologies, routing, switching and security. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is the product lineup that we have in routing today across the MX and the PTX with new line cards, new software that we've introduced on both those platforms in the first half of the year have set us up for a very, very competitive overall product portfolio that is going help us to grow going forward. So I just feel very good about the overall technology situation and our competitiveness of the company in routing. Operator : Our next question... Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question. Operator : ...comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami. I'd like to get your big picture views Rami, on how Juniper plans to drive new growth in optical and in security? For example, would you look to exit any current underperforming products and focus on new growth opportunities in security opticals such as data center optical interconnect, cloud based security as we saw, Akamai (38:57) seeing strength? I'd like to get your thoughts. Thanks, Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Thanks for the question. So both key areas of focus for us, I think that the work that Juniper did a year-and-a-half, two years ago, in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas or the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touch on two of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a standalone business. I think there are enough standalone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of a end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of BTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large somewhat tricky product transitions where we're replacing older security products with newer ones. And we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technologies that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunity is there. I think our vision of a software defined secure network is the right one. And we're hearing very good positive comments from our customers, our partners, as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX4100 and QFX4200 products we just announced at our Annual Customer Event a few weeks ago and they will be making their way into the market very shortly, and that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security products like the virtual SRX where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP Service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security which is all around the cloud. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Hey, thanks, Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on SD-WAN you're highlighting it on your website. And Rami, is this \u2013 is it fair to say that this could impact MPLS router business to the negative but you have an opportunity with CPE in the branch? Or how should we frame SD-WAN as it relates to Juniper? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we do view SD-WAN as a really important opportunity for us. But to be clear, we actually think of the SD-WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are \u2013 that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so, when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that \u2013 the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system and the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being a second one of them. Load balancing capabilities being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of define this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box centric sort of CPE business is relatively small unlike many of our competitors and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS-WAN space, if you will? I think a lot of these solutions will depend on a hybrid model where they will leverage the Internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage the MPLS for other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So most of them have been asked, but I kind of wanted to return real quick to the gross margin piece. If I recall correctly, I believe last quarter, the June quarter, the routing segment was part of the reason why the gross margins were actually better, or a little bit better. But now we're seeing a gross margin beat again. Or sorry, a routing beat again but the margins are going down. So is it fair to say that maybe the QFX (45:13) lower margin than 63% to 64% range? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No. I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. I would say gross margin there are many, many inputs into gross margin from obviously pricing being a large one and I already mentioned pricing was actually relatively stable. We didn't see much change quarter-on-quarter as it relates to pricing. But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching, and security. It gets down to the product lines and even within the product lines whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solutions. So it's a volatile \u2013 it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3. Very in line with what we expected to land, and that's really the update on gross margins. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add it, typically with the introduction of new technologies, new products, the \u2013 they introduce a tailwind to gross margin. So the new QFX products relative to our overall switching business is in fact a positive thing, the exact same thing with routing, because what you're doing is you're leveraging Moore's Law, you're leveraging more modern silicon technology, et cetera, that tends to better optimize the cost per bit per second of your solution. So as you think about the types of things that we're looking at to achieve our long-term gross margin goals, there's supply chain managements and costs there. There's the innovation that goes with the introduction of new technologies that are tailwinds to gross margins. Then there's just innovation. Take, for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space. In particular, the recent acquisition in silicon photonics, which will have not an immediate but a long-term, I think, positive effect on gross margin. And last but not least is business model transformation. As you think about the evolution towards more software-based business models, all of these things are factors that we believe will have a positive impact long-term on gross margins. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. On the QFX, can you discuss what success you're having with the cloud providers? And then how much of the QFX is shipping with 100-Gig and high-density ports? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Erik. Well, the success we're seeing with the QFX is broader-based than just cloud. And it's broader-based than just the top cloud providers. I think that the opportunity is large and it spans across cloud providers, cable operators, telcos and large enterprises. And we're leveraging all of our existing relationships with our customers but also of course going after net new opportunities with the QFX product line, which again I said, I believe is extremely competitive. And in particular, where you see Juniper taking the most share is in fact in the high speed opportunities, which is over 10-Gig, 100-Gig being a perfect sweet spot for us. So if you know Juniper, you know that where we do exceptionally well is where scale and performance matters. And where data centers require 100-Gig interfaces, typically the kinds of scale and performance they require for these data center buildouts are such that we're going to be very competitive. And that is a key area of differentiation for us today. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin question. You said earlier that Juniper is out to take share in switching and cloud. And I think you were referencing more the QFX initiative in that statement. I guess I'm just wondering if I can connect to the gross margin erosion we've seen over the last handful of quarters to that initiative to take share? And then also I think last quarter you talked about some of the margin pressures really being focused in Europe. Is that still the case? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me start. And I'd like Ken to weigh in. The answer to the question is no, it's not just about the QFX. Our ability to take share certainly has an element of pricing to it. But it's much more than that. Technology matters. The broader portfolio solution matters. Things like Professional Services and our ability to go and to help our customers in evolving their networks from a legacy network to a cloud, highly automated data center with solutions like Contrail. All of these are factors. I'm not saying pricing is not a factor, but it's much more complicated than just pricing discussion. It's not just tied to switching, and it's not only tied to Europe. I think it's broader based than that. Right, Ken? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. From a pricing perspective, specifically discounting, we did see some stabilization there this quarter as compared to last. You're right. In Q2 we did call out some elevated pricing pressure specifically in EMEA. So we're not calling out something similar this quarter. It's more broad based but also more stable than we saw last quarter from a pricing perspective. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Great. That helps. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra of Buckingham Research. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Guys, I just wanted you to address Government if you could? In the commentary, it appears that it was down sequentially in Routing, Switching and Security? So I was just wondering, is that a Government issue? Or is that a Juniper issue? Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So from a Government perspective, I'll let you talk about it a little bit, Rami, as well. But from a numbers perspective, we do see some lumpiness in the Government vertical. It's an important vertical for us, but it's not one of our largest couple of verticals, though it does have the propensity to be up or down on a certain deployment as they happen around the world. I would make sure folks understand that Government is an international vertical for us. So we do a fair amount of business internationally in Government sector as well. And what you saw in Q2 was actually a very strong Government number. And so sequentially we saw a little bit of a retraction but it's \u2013 we're still very focused on that vertical going forward. It's really more deployment based than anything else. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'll add is that it remains a key vertical for us. We're highly focused on it. The deals in the Government space tend to be larger and therefore lumpier. And we did see some push out of opportunity, I think in particular around E-Rate and other types of government opportunities. So I'm not too concerned about the Q3 performance. I think we will see good success in that vertical going forward. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks, Rami. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Last thing I would add is we are actually up year-to-date, full year in that sector. So we're very comfortable with that sector just a quarter-to-quarter timing phenomenon. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. The only reason I asked, is it is the final \u2013 was the end of the government fiscal year. So I was thinking maybe the U.S. Fed may have seen some growth and we just didn't see it. That's what I was pointing out. Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Yep. Appreciate the question. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Well, we'd like to thank everyone for your questions and really appreciate you restricting them to one question per firm. That was great. Thanks again. And looks like we are two hours away from the World Series kicking off, so excited about that. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks. Bye-bye. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Reflecting back on 2016, I'm pleased with how we've executed, gained momentum throughout the year and delivered on our objective to grow revenue for the full year. Revenue of $4.990 billion increased approximately 3% from 2015. Our innovation engine at Juniper has resulted in the introduction of several new products addressed the sweet spot of where the biggest market opportunities in networking lie today. We entered 2017 with an outstanding product portfolio and a determination to enable our customers to fuel their cloud businesses or to successfully migrate to cloud architectures. We've delivered on our innovation pipeline while maintaining a sharp focus on disciplined expense management and investing prudently in our longer term growth opportunities. As a result, we expanded full year non-GAAP earnings in 2016 and we expect to see earnings expansion again in 2017 as we look to 2017 we are energized by the opportunities we see from the shift toward the cloud and network automation. The cloud transformation is our primary area of strategic focus and we believe our history and innovation leader and our deep understanding of high performance networking technology position us extremely well to capitalize on this industry transition. Now I would like to summarize the highlights across switching, routing and security. We are very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw strong growth in the data center and with cloud and content providers. Our focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast growing data center switching portfolio. Our QFX family of products saw strong demand with revenue increasing approximately 90% year over year in Q4 and over 50% for fiscal year 2016. Our routing business continues to perform well with both sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4. We have been particularly pleased to see the healthy growth of the routing business in our cloud vertical and view that as proof of our differentiation across both the MX and PTX product families. PTX had another record revenue quarter while MX revenue also increased sequentially as new line card demand continues to grow. In addition, we saw a healthy demand for new MX chassis, a healthy signal for continued interest in our MX portfolio. Our Contrail business continues to show good growth sequentially and year over year, and it diversified across geographies and across various cloud customer segments such as telecom service providers, SaaS, large enterprises and cable MSOs. In Q4, we had a number of marquee customer wins across these sectors and geographies while continuing to get subscription renewals and capacity expansion revenues from existing customer wins. These customer wins enable us to expand our hardware footprint as we help them operationalize next generation services using cloud architectures and high performance networks. In Q4, we acquired AppFormix to complement the analytics and machine learning capabilities of Contrail and to help customers enhance their cloud operations. Various independent research surveys have concluded that Contrail is one of the most widely adopted commercial cloud networking solutions in the market. And we are pleased to see that Contrail is proving to be our customers preferred choice for cloud networking. 2015 was a challenging year for our security business. Having said that, I'm confident that we're taking all the right steps to turn around this part of our business. We have significantly refreshed our product portfolio with new price competitive and feature rich firewall appliances, vastly improve security management with Junos Space Security Director and advanced deception techniques and machine learning to catch zero days threat with Sky ATP. We believe we are gaining mind share from customers, partners and analysts with our refreshed portfolio in the enterprise and expect growth from security in 2017. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. Finally, I want to extend the very big thank you to our employees around the globe who each play an important role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that I will turn the call over to Ken who will review our quarterly and full-year financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. The results for the December quarter reflect record revenue as well as non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Both telecom and cloud providers were up sequentially and cloud providers grew more than 50% year over year. We also saw significant year over year growth from our PTX family of products and QFX product line continued to be strong in the data center with growth of approximately 90% year over year. Our services business remained strong with solid year over year and sequential growth. This growth was partially due to the recognition of approximately 15 million from a professional services project associate with a telecom cloud deployment of Contrail. In reviewing our top ten customers for the quarter, five were cloud providers, three were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers one was located outside of the United States. Looking at our demand metrics, product book to bill was greater than one. Ending product backlog was 441 million, down 76 million year over year while product deferred revenue was 323 million, up 83 million year over year. Our non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margin was up sequentially, driven by higher revenue and improved product mix. The non-GAAP service gross margin was down sequentially due to increased support costs related to the ramp of new products and higher delivery costs related to professional service projects. While we continue to expect the pricing environment to be challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. Non-GAAP operating expenses were also within our guided range for the quarter, up $16 million quarter over quarter and essentially flat year over year. Sequentially the increase was primarily related to a variable compensation related to sales. As a percentage of revenue non-GAAP operating expenses were 36.8%, an improvement of 1.6 points quarter over quarter and 1.7 points year over year. We are pleased with our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66, which reflects an increase of 14% sequentially and 5% year over year. We saw elevated DSO during the fourth quarter, primarily due to significant increases in services invoicing which occurred late in the quarter resulting in higher deferred services revenue. We also saw an impact from the timing of product voicing. We believe the quality of our receivables is strong with the majority expected to be received early this quarter. Going forward, we expect DSOs to be in the range of 50 to 60 days, an increase of five days compared to our previous target range as our average customer payment terms have increased slightly and our deferred revenue balance continues to grow. In the quarter, we had strong cash flows from operations of 334 million, up $88 million sequentially. We paid $38 million in dividends and did not repurchase shares in the quarter. I am pleased that we have completed our commitment to return $4.1 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016. Moving on to the results for the full year. As expected, fiscal 2016 saw modest growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Revenue growth was driven by cloud providers which increased more than 25% year over year. While routing was approximately flat, our PTX family of products had significant year-over-year growth. Switching grew 12% driven by continued data center strength led by QFX family of products which increased more than 50% year over year. Security remains challenged but we are confident in our new products and our strategy. Our services business continue to be strong with another year of solid year over year growth. In revealing our top ten customers for the year, four were cloud providers, four were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 1 point from last year due to elevated pricing pressure and product mix, partly offset by an improvement in our services margin and our cost structure. For the year, non-GAAP operating expenses increased due to acquisitions, partially offset by savings in variable compensation. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were 39.8%, an improvement of nearly 0.5 point year every year reflecting our continued focus on operational discipline and executing to our long-term model of 39%. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.06 year-over-year primarily driven by lower share count and higher revenue partially offset by lower gross margin. For the year we had strong cash flow from operations of $1.106 billion, up $213 million primarily driven by timing differences of working capital. We repurchased $313 million of shares and paid $153 million in dividends. Now let's review our expectations and financial principles for 2017. We continue to operate in a competitive market and expect timing of our customer's deployment patterns to vary from quarter to quarter. We intend to manage the business in 2017 with those considerations in mind and we'll continue to focus on driving shareholder value with the following three financial principles as a guide. First, we expect revenue growth for 2017. We are pursuing opportunities with our differentiated product portfolio within our target markets and will focus on growth from emerging technologies as the market landscape continues to evolve. Second, we remain focused on earnings expansion with long term consistency. We will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses while balancing investments for short term and long term. We intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2017. Finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure by balancing internal investments and the potential for balancing of M&A. We expect continued strong cash flow generation and intend to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 which you can find detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our first quarter outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the US dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products within the target markets we serve. The gross margin guidance for the quarter reflects typical seasonal patterns, primarily due to the sequential lower revenue volume. While we expect to continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on disciplined cost management. As a reminder, the operating expense guidance for the quarter includes the annual reset available compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yeah guys thanks for taking my questions. I guess I wanted to start with switching that number was considerably better than we expected and we had pretty positive views of your switching business. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what sort of RFP activity you've seen from the cloud providers. If you give it any kind of numbers on you know how many people are evaluating you as the first or second source in the spine particularly would be interesting I think just any other color you can give us on what's happening particularly with the cloud service providers and switching. And then I also want to ask about the deferred revenue. The services deferred revenue in particular it was up significantly more than what we saw last year the same time, I wonder could you talk about the timing of recognition about revenue, is it likely to be a little quicker than you would see with a typical product deferred revenue increase or should we expect it over the next two or three quarters, any idea of how that plays out would be great. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Rod, let me start and then I'll pass on the question on the deferred revenue to Ken. On switching, yes, obviously we're very pleased with the results both sequentially and year over year as you know and as we've been talking to you about for quite some time now the cloud vertical and the cloud transition across all of our customers is the biggest driver of our strategy and one of the ways in which we want to capture that transition is with a very robust switching portfolio. The strength that we're seeing is mostly in the QFX product line which is targeted at the cloud and at the data center. Although I should say that EX product line also grew sequentially which is an encouraging sign. And the new QFX spine switches, which is the 10000 are now in the market the last of which would be 10016 that was just shipped in a Q4 time frame are doing well. And in terms of our P activity, we would not see this level of performance in our switching portfolio all up without the strength of our spine switches. It really comes - it plays out in two ways, first is that they contribute to the top line, they're now contributing in a meaningful way to the top line even though they're still relatively early in their life cycle. The second way is there were opportunities as I've been saying that we were really shut out from historically because we only had a portion of the overall data center switching opportunity. We now have an ability to position an end-to-end play that includes the spine, the aggregation, the access and the top of rack. And also I should mention in many cases we can bundle routing, we can bundle security and our Contrail orchestration system as well. So we're very pleased with our switching results. Ken? Ken Miller : On the deferred revenue front, on the services side, the majority of our service revenue is maintenance and support and typically we sell those at one-year renewals. However, some customers do buy multi-year renewals, two, three or four year renewals and on a balance sheet you actually we break out the long term portion of deferred revenue and if it's due within 12 months typically radically over 12 months it will be in the short-term deferred, if it's beyond 12 months, it shall be long-term deferred. Another growing piece of our services business is professional services side and that's something that's obviously very strategic to us and oftentimes does get deferred initially until we deliver the services we mentioned in Q4 we recognized 15 million of professional services related to a telecom cloud build out with Contrail. So that's - the minority of our services deferred revenue but that is a growing piece as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha : Just a couple of questions firstly. On long term model, Rami, it looks like in terms of revenue growth you guys have talked about 3% to 6% you weren't quite there last year. Should we expect acceleration in growth to be able to hit those numbers and those targets still hold. On the gross margin point is any of the sequential drop in gross margin that we're seeing pricing related there were some issues I think a couple of course ago if you could comment on that your visibility in gross margin and the puts and takes around it that would be helpful as well. Rami Rahim : Thanks. Let me start. So we are going to stick to our 3% to 6% growth guidance or outlook that we have provided. Having said that clearly the mix that we have provided won't play out exactly as we had predicted, security in 2016 did worse than we expected and that's because of the fact that we missed time to transition. As I mentioned I'm confident in the steps that we\u2019re taken and the momentum that we're seeing in the new products associated with security. Having said that I don't think that in a three year period security will grow as fast as we had anticipated because of the weaker start. That said I think switching is doing extremely well we're confident in our revenue portfolio. And all up, we can maintain that 3% to 6% overall revenue range. Ken Miller : From a gross margin perspective, I mean, obviously there's many factors that impact gross margin, there is microenvironment, competitive landscape, product mix, customer mix et cerebra. We did hit slightly higher than the mid-point of our range in Q4 of 63.2% of gross margin and I do expect 63% to be kind of the expectation for the near term. I mentioned that on the last 90 days ago on the previous call. I do think 63% is a reasonable near term assumption on gross margin. For Q1 though, we did guided 62.5% and that is very much due to the volume of revenue and we do have seasonal pattern revenue from Q4 to Q1 and we also have a seasonal pattern of gross margin just due to volume mix. Operator : Now our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski : Hi Thank you very much wanted to clarify something. First I think you said that your cloud customers were up 25% for the year and if I recall they were 19% back in 2015 as a percent of revenue. So the math would suggest there are about 23% of your revenue in 2016. So just wanted to confirm that. And then for my question just wanted to hear your views on carrier CapEx going forward. We started to hear some slightly more constructive commentary this week in particular in the context of the potential reversal of net neutrality. So I\u2019d love to hear any opinions you may have on that. Ken Miller : Yes Simona, so you got the numbers right so we were 19%, the cloud vertical was 19% of our revenue in 2015 and it did grow actually slightly greater than 25% from a full year basis this year and I'm sure you've done the math correctly after that. Rami Rahim : Yeah, look Simona, thanks for the question. As far as carrier outlook, I think first in Q4 we saw a good sequential increase in revenue in the carrier space, we had predicted this primarily because we expected some year-end spending by the carriers. The outlook I think remains somewhat you know that the outlook is still somewhat challenged and that there is a bit of a new normal in the carrier space that we've been talking about for a while we see the same reports that you see in terms of CapEx spending and that tells us that they that carry spending is essentially stabilized i.e. the declines that we had seen historically are pretty much behind us at this period of time. We're not expecting in our full-year outlook any sort of major recovery in carrier spending. I think where the spending is going to remain robust is going to be in the cloud space where we have been really focusing and seeing really good growth been throughout last year and I think that continues this year. Operator : Now next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead sir. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to ask on the QFX series product and the growth that you're seeing at the high end on the spine side. To what extent has that materialized what inning do you think we're in terms of that product cycle and with that how would you characterize your net new customer base expansion within the switch business with regard to the QFX product. Rami Rahim : So the QFX product line as you know there are the top of rack component within their new spine switches that we've introduced over the last year. They're still early in their product life cycle in many cases we are competing in opportunities where they're still in the evaluation phase. They're being tested our customers are gaining more confidence in the operations of the product and so on. In some cases they are net new customers like I said we never really had an opportunity to break into without having these products but in other cases we have been relying on the relationships or taken advantage of the relationship that we have with our existing customers where they might already be routing or security customers that now have an ability to take advantage of a switching product line that has the same operating system, the same operational model. So it's a nice balance at this period of time of the types of customers and the opportunities that we are engaged in right now. And like I said it's still early days in terms of where we are in the product lifecycle. We just introduced the 10016 in the Q4 time, so just a few weeks ago. And we are absolutely continuing to invest in the product line so you can expect to see an increase in software capabilities, new line cards that leverage, new silicon chip sets and so on in the future. Operator : Now our next question comes from line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : My question let me start on the revenue side obviously switching is great and better than we would have hoped. Can you talk about the routing out look a little AT&T in particular seems to be thinking that they are able to get a lot of feedings on what they call the big iron at the core of the network? And they were referring to NFE et cetera et cetera. I'm wondering to what extent we should think about that as a factor for you when considering 2017 view? Rami Rahim : So we're pleased with our routing performance in Q4 we saw 5% sequential growth and you know modest year of year growth as well as. Most of the strength however in 2016 in routing and in and in Q4 in particular from the cloud vertical and that's a result of the fact that the demand for cloud services is growing very rapidly and cloud customers typically really value high performance highly efficient power efficient infrastructure that is exactly of the type that Juniper has and continues to develop. So I'm optimistic about the strength of that particular vertical as I mentioned I think in terms of the telco space there is a there is a new normal as the telco customer the ball there architectures to cloud architecture they're going to delay investments in traditional routing infrastructure and what we need to do here is to make sure that we engage with them in a way that allows us to benefit from the new architectures when they start to take shape and this is where Contrail and virtual routing and virtual security and other such types of technologies that we're developing really come into play today. We're not expecting any dramatic increase in telco spending any time in the near future and that's built into our outlook overall. Jeff Kvaal : Ken, on a clarification you talked about operating margin expansion through the year. It doesn't seem as though the first quarter is starting off with material operating margin expansion. Could you talk a little bit about how things will improve through the year? Ken Miller : So we\u2019ll continue to manage OpEx prudently, I think we've done a pretty good job of it over the last few quarters and we\u2019ll continue that going into next year. We are looking to grow - to expand that margin on a full-year basis and that's where we're focused on making sure that we manage OpEx to create that earnings growth as well as to invest in what we invest in. So it really comes down to optimizing our structure, making sure we\u2019re efficient as possible and improving our productivity as we move forward. Jeff Kvaal : So gross margin comes back a little bit and then you hold the line on OpEx after the first quarter, after a little artificially high first quarter. Ken Miller : Yeah. And the revenue growth obviously will be more seasonal and sequential and OpEx will not have a similar ramp is traditionally is the case and [indiscernible] throughout the year. Operator : Now our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Two related questions if I might. First with respective pricing is the pressure you been citing this quarter previously is that the defense of offensive nature, I know you said is pricing pressure but ultimately stated, is this pressure from other companies that you're responding to or is this Juniper electing to use price in order to gain footprint which would be understandable especially [indiscernible]. And the related question is with respect to the operating margin commentary on a 25% goal. When you look at the data over the past 15 years dating back to the bursting of the bubble. It seems you're holding 25% is proving to be a Sisyphean task. You haven't done it and here's my question given the relatively recent issue of incremental pricing pressure over the past year, why is that going to be unsuitable in future? Rami Rahim : Let me start Paul and I\u2019ll pass it over to Ken. To your first question around what we're seeing in terms of pricing pressure, there is no sort of deliberate strategy that Juniper is executing on where we are going to start to use pricing as more of a tool to go after market opportunities. It's more of a reaction to what we're seeing in certain vertical certain geographies we've talked about EMEA in particular where competition is getting a bit more aggressive and so we are always going after opportunities where high performance networking where the quality of the products where the performance and the scale and the automation capabilities matters but we're seeing that in order to be competitive. Even with those attributes and those differentiator we're having to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing so that's really what it comes down to not a specific and deliberate strategy by Juniper at this point. Ken Miller : And from an operating margin target perspective we've been in the 23.5% to 24% last couple years. So we're within a point or two of our long term model we're going to continue to focus on do that. I do think we have some efficiencies left in the business where we could optimize our cost structure and still grow revenues. So really revenue growth is the focus and maintaining a prudent cost structure as we get there is how we get to 25%. Rami Rahim : I think the other thing just to mention one with respect to our cost of goods sold in gross margins of with the introduction of new products always after you get through sort of the beginning period of ramping up the product they tend to be favorable to gross margin because you're leveraging more as well you\u2019re leveraging newer technology and so on. And we are seeing that the new products as they ramp are contributing, they are a tailwind when to gross margin so as they take or represent a larger fraction of overall revenue it helps us in achieving our longer term model. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani : I have two questions one. What's baked and I apologize I joined the call it is a bit late, maybe you addressed in your remarks. What's baked into your EPS guidance for next quarter what kind of assumption? Do you factor in continued weakness in international markets and strength in North America or do you see different trends for next quarter? And the second question about your security portfolio. You haven't refreshed the high end service provider appliance yet and the question is how do you see the market or your growth evolving in the next year or two. Is it based on certain products that you still don't have in the market and you still need to bring to the market or is it more based on efforts that you have to on sales fronts et cetera. I'm trying to understand what brings beyond the seasonal weakness we see this quarter. What brings recovery and security for the next few quarters? Rami Rahim : I will start with the security question and then Ken can you can address the EPS question. You\u2019re right Tal in that the primary focus over the last year or so in security has been on refreshing the low end of our security products and the midrange so we've introduced the SRX1500, 4,100, 4,200 in their class across low and mid-range they are best in class in terms of price performance. We have plans to refresh entire portfolio of security products because one of the things that we were struggling from has been that the all of our security products the hardware was older and it was not price competitive. We've already addressed a big fraction of our products made in far more price competitive. As we move forward into 2017 what we're doing is aggressively adding more and more features and capabilities to the newer hardware product better in the market. I can tell you that the feedback that we're getting from our partners our customers analysts has all been very positive and very encouraging and this is why we're actually seeing some momentum in your product the issue is just that the older products have been declining very rapidly and part of that has been because of a very aggressive end of life strategy and part of that was due to the European Rojas requirements that you know we were dealing with last year. So much of that is behind us and that's why I believe that we're in a much better position in 2017 than we were in \u201815. There is a focus in \u201817 now on go to market and on marketing just make sure that we complement what we believe is that is strength in our product with the necessary engine to sell. Ken Miller : Yeah. And from an EPS perspective on the guidance, it really starts when EPS falls out from the P&L, let me briefly touch on revenue gross margin OpEx. So from a revenue guidance perspective as you all know Q1 is typically seasonally down quarter for us sequentially as customers who complete their CapEx spending in Q4 and in certain cases take time to finalize their new spending plans for the new year and we're seeing that now. As a reminder of revenue we did realize the benefit of $15 million of professional service related to Contrail developed rollout on Telco cloud and that's something that tends to be lumpy in Q4 benefited from that that's also we get baked out into your sequentials but there are many factors to go into revenue guidance such as dual visibility, backlog levels, differed revenue balances and based on the factors I believe that in Q1 revenue guidance is appropriate at this time as we look to manage the business from Q1 and beyond. From a gross margin perspective, I still feel that 63% is the right near term target to be putting in your models but for Q1 due to the revenue volume declines sequentially we do typically see a gross margin impact about 510s so that's what baked out into our gross margin guidance. And then from an OpEx perspective the operating guidance does include the annual reset of variable compensation as well as from seasonal increases in fringe costs which is typical for us as we go from Q4 to Q1. So really those are the factors that generate the EPS guidance that we put out there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Jess Lubert : First I wanted to follow up on can read remarks just there and on the revenue outlook is that the book to bill was greater than one product deferred accelerated it sounds like you're seeing strength across product categories that you're guiding for sequential decline below what we've seen in four of the last five years. So I was hoping to understand to what extent that reflects conservatism or perhaps some of the other factors that are embedded in the numbers that are causing you to guide for what on a historical basis would be below seasonal revenue results. And then Rami, a question on the cloud routing opportunity was hoping to understand to what extent. You're seeing the availability of merchant base solution, changed the nature of the conversation you're having and to what extent would you expect to see pricing in that vertical materially change as the availability of these merchant platforms become more available through the course of the year. Rami Rahim : Just let me start with the cloud question and then Ken you can talk about the seasonality of revenue. So just on the cloud discussions we're having certainly there is a lot of sort of interesting discussion in the industry around margin but honestly when we're talking about our routing portfolio, our switching portfolio with our cloud customers, the conversation is mostly around things like price performance, total performance, manageability, automation all of these things depend not just on the silicon choices but also on the software stack that\u2019s on top of the silicon. And as I have said I believe that we have no religion when it comes to choosing certain technology elements other than choosing the best element that will result in the best product all up and thus far we have made all the right decisions and some cases we've chosen merchant in other cases we have chosen cost and silicon will continue to make the right decisions going forward. In terms of impact on pricing, I would say that pricing compression is a fact of life for our industry and have been so for many years to come whether it's based on custom silicon or merchant silicon especially with the introduction of new port speeds, what the expectation is in the at least early stages of that introduction the price compression is going to be fairly rapid. And where we see that trend and we're comfortable with it and will continue to focus on the cost of our products that allow us to compete competitively while preserving our overall profitability. Ken Miller : On the Q1 revenue guidance, we did put an outlook out there that we expect growth in 2017. There's a lot that goes into the guidance as you know, dual visibility, backlog levels and deferred revenue and we factored all those factors, we think the guidance is appropriate. I wouldn\u2019t call it cautious, I would call it appropriate guidance given the factors that we have, the indication we have as well the fact as I mentioned we are looking to manage the business beyond one quarter at a time and make sure that we manage appropriately going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Just a quick question on your mix today and how you see that playing out in 2017. So if I look at your revenues back by region you are like an all-time highs in squad in the U.S. and actually in the rest of the word if anything looks like a much more challenging environment and then if you look at it from a client perspective as you say you cloud business grew and grew massively So when you're talking about growth next year. Where is that coming from. So do you expect cloud to keep growing very fast like that. How do you think. Other types of clients are getting to two relays a growth player that you had this year and then some question in terms of friction do you bacon to your what you face for 2017 a recovery outside those U.S. owes us going from one recall to another one. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Pierre let me comment on the regional split so clearly I think you for the strength. It was primarily in the Americas and you know it's primarily in the cloud vertical You know the thing that the Americas has going for it is the fact that you know this country has the largest cloud provider customers in the world. So our diversification strategy plays out much easier here in the U.S. then it would in India as we have seen as we have been saying is more challenging competitively and our opportunity to diversify is there across which in but not to the extent that it exists here in the Americas again because of the absence of large hyperscale or cloud providers in that region and Asia Pacific. As you know we've had actually really good momentum over the last several quarters some decline in Q4 a lot of that has to do with a difficult compare quite honestly relative to Q4 of last year with a large telco that had to spend in end of two thousand and fifteen timeframe but I think a fact our penetration in many accounts is so small that we have a really good opportunity to increase our share and continue that momentum going forward. So most I'm most bush but the Americas because of the opportunity for us to diversify and the opportunity for us to tap into the cloud vertical I said I remain bullish on APAC in our property need to take share and to leverage partnerships like the one we have with Lenovo to gain some momentum. And EMEA know I'm big cautious on quite frankly just based on the comment that we've already made around the competitiveness of that theater. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mark Moskowitz : Yes thanks Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up a moment the schedule around margin and pricing. What should we read into in terms of the guidance around the five days increase in DSO to that's due to exchange of customer payment terms that are reflection of trying to offset from these pricing pressures or Pratt provide to mitigate or is a reflection of incremental revenue now is coming from customers. Maybe a little more stretched maybe a little more credit quality trying to understand that dynamic. And then more big picture, Rami I wanted you to weigh in on 2017 as far as the growth profile how much of that is dependent on 100-gig E adoption accelerating versus other. Rami Rahim : Thanks Marc let me start with the second question. Where Juniper does best is typically in high performance networking opportunities that is true in the white area that is true inside of the data center where our customers truly value our capabilities that they're around you know robust high quality and ultra-scalable networks and hundred gig plays very much into that where I think if you were to take a look at our market share reports in switching for example where we're growing the fastest and taking the greatest market share is in the forty gig and hundred gig inflection point that's happening in the data center and in other switching opportunities so it's a big factor. Ken Miller : From a DSO perspective we did increase the range of the target range by five days when we looked at our payment term structure today and our customer class and the mix of our customers. It was a few days you know less than five in a few days on average on a payment term clearly depending on when you ship we have customers but there is a payment terms forty five sixty exciter or so really it comes with a mix of timing as well as payment terms which has an impact of DSO and based on our analysis we feel fifty to sixty is a better range going forward and it really has nothing to do with our credit quality we have not changed our quota quality we have not gotten more aggressive on the way we find credit to customers. It's really just the next issue and a timing issue. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Justin on for Jim. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit further. Do you size as you're seeing in the QFX family of products because you know that experience of this close quarter as well as maybe any sort of commentary that you're able to provide in terms of the pipeline going forward. Rami Rahim : Thanks. Yes thanks Justin. I think in it's a pretty broad spectrum to be honest there are larger customers that are now spending that always in fact spends more on very large cloud billouts that have been true for the QFX top of rack that had been in the market for quite some time. I think that will remain true for the 10-Ks as well. And then we do have a commercial motion to where our partners are positioning are switching products across the broader spectrum of smaller you know opportunities telco cloud is another area that's still relatively early and smaller in size in terms of total opportunity but it is in fact a growing opportunity that we're capturing especially with our relevance that we created with contrail but we're seeing a contrail is resulting in a nice pull in hardware and in particular edge routing and switching like the QFX products. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : I like to hear your thoughts and you know how we should think of products and services revenue good interesting dynamic last year we saw you know delicately because they know they look really strong services and services pretty much sponsored you know line number. Could be anticipate any new product or for a second. And you know anywhere still in this product or services that new group tragic this year. Rami Rahim : Let me start and I'm sure can and will have something to add it is true all up for the year of the product picture. It shows sort of flattish or slightly down revenue but I think it's worthwhile looking at Q4 in particular at least the second half of 2016 with a new product of really kicked in. Because they're I think the product of the sort of picture start to change especially as you look at routing in and switching in routing then you products that we've introduced the PX product line the new next line cards are growing very nicely in switching back chassis view effect line cards are growing very nicely so this isn't you know the second half of one we said the new products will start to contribute and where they are contributing good news going to 2017 is we are going to start the year with a very competitive very robust portfolio. Ken you want to comment? Ken Miller : I would just say I mean we do you expect to grow into the 2017 we put that in or how that for 2017 and we are not going to breakout product versus service but I would we expect to grow in both product and service in 2017 for many reasons to reasons that Rami just outlined. Operator : And our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. George Notter : So this is sort of an oddball question, I realize if I look back I think you guys have reported eight straight quarters of product book to bill greater than one, yet if I look at your product sales in two thousand and sixteen. It was actually down 1% year on year I guess I'm hoping you guys can help me reconcile those two comments and use it a case where product to build this isn't that meaningful for you guys or is it a case where the orders get canceled hopefully I guess I'm trying to understand those two things. Rami Rahim : The primary difference would be I think you might be missing would be the deferred revenue balance. So, product book to bill is an important, we do track it internally. However, on the revenue side clearly, the deferred revenue growth would impact our ability to recognize revenue. So you have to factor that into the equation. So the deferred revenue growth would be the primary difference. There are other kind of accounting adjustments and reserves that have a minor impact to the book to bill ratio, but for the most part, it\u2019s deferred revenue that causes I believe the disconnect that you're talking about. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking my question here. First, I just wanted to clarify the operating expense guidance for Q1. It seems to me at least my impression is that it's probably erring on the conservative side, in other words, maybe a little bit higher than what you think you can do and the reason I'm drawing this conclusion is that you talk about the commission that\u2019s driving up the sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter. So we've got a sequential sales decline. So I assume that sales and marketing would be down sequentially. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing maybe some one-time items or increased items that affect G&A or R&D in that March guidance. Ken Miller : Yes. So sales related variable comp should come down sequentially quarter on quarter. However, the two items that offset that and actually have us grown by $1 million in our guidance which I believe is appropriate guidance is really the fringe reset. So we do have a declining fringe rate throughout the year and things like FICA tax, et cetera, decline over the year. So we have a reset in Q1 every year on fringe and we also have the other variable cost components of the corporate programs that reset at 100%. So we did see some stableness in last year\u2019s OpEx because variable comp was less than target due to our financial performance. That has to reset to 100% in Q1. So those are the two reasons why 515 plus or minus 5 is our OpEx forecast for Q1. Simon Leopold : Okay. Thanks for that. And then in terms of the 100-gig opportunities, you talked earlier about Juniper typically excel as a kind of high performance, wondering whether you're seeing any constraints in terms of the supply chain, whether it's in the optical transceivers or the semiconductors necessary for those 100-gig performing products. Rami Rahim : Yes. The thing that we're keeping a very close eye on as all of our peers are in the optics space, the 100-gig optic space. There are certain parts of 100-gig optics that are constrained. Right now, we don't expect that to cause any challenge, unless something changes, but let's just say that we're managing it very closely and we're working very closely with our optical vendors to make sure that we have the supply necessary to satisfy our expected demand for next year. Simon Leopold : And one last one if I might, in terms of your thought for the routing business into the cloud customers, where you've had some great strength. What is your thought on the changing dynamic of competition and I'm alluding to a switching vendor that just had strong cloud business in is trying to move into routing as well as a more traditional service provider competitor who would like to sell into the cloud, both setting their sights on the customers that you've been successful with. How do you think this plays out in 2017 and 2018? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So there's no doubt that there is a lot of interest by many of our peers, our competitors in this industry to see success in routing and switching with the large hyperscaler customers. But that said, we have been working extremely closely, engineer-to-engineer type of relationship level with all of the cloud provider customers and have a deep and intense understanding of what it is that they require, that they need, many of the products that are seeing great success today like our PTX product line where built with a keen understanding of their requirements. So while, yes, the landscape is competitive and it'll probably get even more competitive, I would say that I have confidence in our ability to compete from a technology standpoint and in just sheer understanding of what these guys actually need going forward. The last thing I want to mention is, we enjoy a really great position in this space. So yeah, we have to play a bit of a defensive game to prevent others from encroaching into our space, but we're also playing a very offensive game when it comes to the data center opportunity. And based on the results that you saw in Q4, I think you can conclude that we\u2019re actually starting to become very successful there. Kathleen Nemeth : Thanks, Simon. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Sure. And our final question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves : Hi, guys. I just had a quick question just in terms of that modeling. Thanks for the overall annual revenue, but if I think about the sequential now for calendar year \u201817, is it safe to assume that the signal look a little bit more like \u201816 because it doesn't look like it's in line with what\u2019s historically done on a Q-over-Q basis? Rami Rahim : From a sequential going forward in \u201817, is that the question. Mitch Steves : Right. Yeah. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of a little more like \u201816 or what you guys have seen historically? Rami Rahim : I think actually the FY16 quarterly sequentials were pretty good benchmark for us going forward. I think, you\u2019ll see sequential growth throughout the year in revenue and operating margin as we go throughout the year. Mitch Steves : Okay. And then quickly from a product perspective, it's roughly the same as well? Rami Rahim : From a growth rate sequential basis, I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on the mix of revenue, but I do expect sequential revenue growth. Kathleen Nemeth : Okay. Thank you, operator. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of the day. We thank you for your time and participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-K, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we are now providing revenue commentary for our key customer vertical : Cloud, Telecom and Cable, and Strategic Enterprise and we no longer intend to provide revenue commentary on the Service Provider and Enterprise market. For historical revenue information by vertical, please see our CFO Commentary, which is furnished with the 8-K filed today. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We were off to a positive start in 2017 and delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the March quarter. Total revenue was $1.221 billion at the high end of our guidance range and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer verticals. We delivered strong profitability metrics with year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We believe we are benefiting from our diversification strategy and I'm pleased with our overall performance. We believe the biggest trend that is driving our industry and our strategy as a company today is the cloud. As the industry evolves, cloud architectures are no longer the exclusive domain of the cloud providers. Customers across all verticals are developing strategies for moving to cloud service delivery models and this aligns with our strategy to power the cloud transformation. I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals. In the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation roadmap and announced two new solutions for the data center. In January, we announced Juniper Networks Unite Cloud, a transformative data center solution that gives enterprises a simplified way to create and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. This solution delivers a secure and agile platform and is designed to reduce the total cost of ownership while increasing long-term return on our investments for our customers. At the OFC conference in March, we introduced our data center interconnect solution, Open Cloud Interconnect. This comprehensive DCI solution brings together our strength across packet and optical domains to enable a diverse range of network operators to accelerate cloud service delivery, while simplifying network operations. Earlier this year, we were delighted and honored to receive Vodafone Group's most prestigious award for Supplier of the Year. Juniper is a strategic provider of IP routing and security technology for Vodafone, specifically for next-generation data centers, IP/MPLS (sic) [IP/MLPS] (05:06) backbone and mobile backhaul domains. We believe that our continued strategy to lead in network innovation in key areas such as automation, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization will continue to enable our Telco customers to build new and innovative business models going forward. Now, I'd like to summarize highlights across switching, routing and security. In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix. We are seeing continued traction in our QFX portfolio as customers across all verticals move to 100-gig, where we have industry-leading products. Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX. We continued to see healthy demand for our newest generation of MX line cards, which had a record shipping quarter in Q1. Tremendous work has gone into the security product portfolio that we are very proud of. Juniper's differentiated SDSN strategy has been received very well by industry analysts and customers for its ability to detect and stop threats in a highly automated way. The innovative approach of viewing security as an open platform allows customers to leverage all existing security investments as well as their entire network infrastructure. At RSA, we announced new technology alliance partnerships with leading security providers that simplify deployment of Juniper's security solutions across several customer use cases. Our focus this year in security is on building confidence and momentum with our partners and customers. We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products. Several global trials are also underway with managed service providers using Juniper's secure cloud managed enterprise solutions. We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe. There was a continued expansion of orders within our existing customer base as they increased their deployment footprint. We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA. To summarize, we are executing well in a competitive environment and are proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio. The cloud is a massive paradigm shift that is reshaping all industries, and I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also want to extend a very big thank you to our employees for their commitment and hard work, which plays a significant role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that said, I will turn the call over to Ken, who will review our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the March quarter reflects strong year-over-year revenue and earnings per share growth. From a revenue perspective, all verticals increased year-over-year led by Cloud, which increased 25%. We continued to see strong growth in our QFX product family, which grew over 50% year-over-year. We continued to see strength from our Services business, which grew 14% year-over-year driven by strong renewal and attach rates, as well as the recognition of previously deferred revenue from a telecom customer in Asia Pacific. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. While non-GAAP service gross margin was strong year-over-year, non-GAAP product gross margin declined 2.2 percentage points. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to customer mix as we expand our footprint with certain strategic APAC telecom and cloud customers as well as the product mix sold into our Cloud vertical. The decrease was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and higher revenue volume. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, below our guided range for the quarter, reflecting our ongoing disciplined operating expense management. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to head count costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and higher variable compensation. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year, primarily driven by higher revenue. We had particularly strong cash flows from operations of $545 million, up $373 million year-over-year. The increase was driven by strong collections in the quarter, partially related to invoicing that occurred late last quarter. As expected, DSO rebounded and was 49 days. The reduction was primarily due to improved invoicing linearity this quarter. We continued to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $125 million of shares and paying $38 million in dividends during the first quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined last quarter. As a reminder, those principles are : we expect revenue growth for 2017; we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency; and finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. Although elements of our markets are challenged, we expect to grow revenue this year. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from our Cloud vertical. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate gross margin levels similar to Q1 as we expect the customer and product mix dynamics to continue. Increased pricing for certain memory components could also present an additional headwind. We intend to drive earnings expansion this year through focused execution and operating expense discipline. We also intend to drive to our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue this year, which is earlier than previously committed. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And now the first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Ken \u2013 sorry, for Rami, the switching business was strong. I was hoping you could help us understand the pipeline of opportunities you're seeing with the QFX buying offerings and given these products only became available over the last few quarters, is it reasonable to think, the business here could further strengthen as these opportunities mature? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could touch on the gross margin outlook. You previously talked about being comfortable with 63%. It looks like we'll be trending below that level for the year. Just wanted to understand if there's been a change in the competitive environment, what gives you confidence margins won't continue to deteriorate? And longer term, do you think we can get back to 63%, 64%? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Jess, it's Rami. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken. On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture. The heart of that is the data center. We've always been in this space. We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera. Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in. And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term. I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus. And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side. And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center. Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments. And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe. With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, sure. So the gross margin landscape is very dynamic, as you know, Jess, and there are many factors that impact our gross margin. Clearly, you mentioned pricing. I would say the pricing environment is always challenging. We have not seen a broad-based change in that pricing environment. Really what's impacting us in Q1 and for our outlook is really product mix and customer mix. From a customer mix perspective, we are seeing some opportunity to grow with some strategic customers in telecom and cloud, both domestically and abroad, we're taking advantage of that opportunity. That does put some modest pressure on some of our gross margins. In addition to that from a product mix perspective, the strength that we are seeing in switching, which is ahead of our expectations, switching within the Cloud vertical in particular, does have some modest pressure on our margins as well. Last but not least, as it relates to our outlook, we are seeing some pricing pressure on memory. There are some memory components that are under pressure, and we expect that to be a factor for the rest of the year. From a long-term perspective, we remain focused on driving margin improvements. We continue to focus on our cost structure. As the software business picks up, we expect that to be a tailwind for our margins going forward. And obviously our biggest driver is continuing to deliver product innovation to market and monetize that innovation. The last thing I would say is while we are doing our best to maximize margin, we remain very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability. Our goal is to make sure that we have earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and that's what we're really focused on. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you. I had a follow-up on each of the questions that was just asked. So first for Rami, thank you for disclosing the Cloud vertical. I did notice that there was a sequential decrease in your routing revenues in the Cloud vertical, and routing missed expectations. So curious if that's because some of those customers are transitioning to QFX when they would have previously used routers? And do you expect your routing business overall to grow with the Cloud vertical? And then for Ken on the gross margin question, you had cited price pressure in the last two quarters, and this quarter, that does not seem to have been a factor. So just wanted to see if that has in fact subsided. But on the flip side, when you're highlighting the cost supplier issue and DRAM prices, is that something you can quantify for us, just so we understand the incremental impact? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Simona. I will start with the follow up on routing and switching. And then I'll pass it over to Ken. So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly. Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry. We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products. That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals. That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today. And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there. I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on. The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot. One is really targeted for the edge. One is for wide area. One is more for the data center. But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products. But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect. There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a pricing perspective, Simona, the pricing environment is always a challenging environment, it has been for many, many years in this space. What I mentioned is we didn't see any specific broad-based deterioration beyond what we expected. We always expect pricing pressure, and it largely came in as we expected this quarter. But what we did see though were some strategic selling insertion opportunities. I mentioned customer mix. We are definitely getting strategic in some of the international customers in particular in the telecom and cloud space and these are customers that we are very deliberate with in regard to these deals and we do expect margin to improve over time as our footprint expands. So that does have a pricing impact, but again, it's at a very specific customer level. On the cost of memory side, it is a factor \u2013 really the three factors I've mentioned, the customer mix, the product mix and the cost of memory, all relatively weighted pretty evenly as far as our margin guidance of 62.5%, which I believe is still a pretty healthy margin guidance for the year. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow. But your dividend yield is half that of Cisco and the price discount -- the stock is trading at 20% discount to Cisco because of that. What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield? That's the first question. The second question is about security. You have products and new dynamics, but the revenues were down 10% for the year \u2013 year-over-year, can you discuss the outlook for 2017? What are the ups and downs? What are the puts and takes in security growth? And when do you see the inflection point of turning from declines to growth? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Tal. Let me start and I'll start with the security question. And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy. Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis. And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there. There is in fact momentum. The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive. And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business. It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products. So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor. We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth. And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth. I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe. I think we can get this back on track. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And as we previously committed to, the 50% of free cash flow is what we're comfortable with for this year. That would be inclusive of both share repurchases and dividends. And we'll look to be opportunistic with our share buyback programs throughout the year. That said, we're always looking to optimize our capital structure, and we will reevaluate things as things change. For example, our financial performance, our cash needs, as well as our valuation will all be factors into some reevaluation of our capital return program. In addition, we've obviously paid attention to what's going on with the new administration with tax repatriation and/or tax changes. So those could be other factors that we'll have to consider when and if they come to fruition. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Just one question will be on (25:51) this year. For the verticals you are talking about; the Cloud, the Telco and Cable, and Enterprise, can you speak about any trends we should be aware of? For example, could the cloud business start facing difficult compares and start to decelerate? Is that something we should think about at some point as we start exiting maybe 2017? And then on the Telco side, I think it was better than we thought. Can you just give us some details behind what drove that in Q1? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami. So let me start. First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification. It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco. It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions : first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and \u2013 sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo. So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe. We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific. So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us. Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy. Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward. Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Yes. Thanks very much. A question and a clarification. I think in the past you all have talked about 3% to 6% revenue growth as a CAGR. I'm wondering if that sort of applies to this year? And if so, what are the puts and takes to the low and high-end of that range? And then secondly, Ken, at one point, you had sort of passed on a chance to endorse 63% as a longer-term model, but then you said you think some of the new contracts that you've won in Asia and in cloud will grow the margins over time. So I'm wondering if we can pin you down a little bit on that long-term model. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: The gross margin? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: First, yeah, the revenue... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let's talk about revenue first, and I'll talk about the numbers and then, Rami, maybe you could talk about what would put us on the high-end, low-end of that range. So at this point, based on what we see today, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6%, which is our long-term model. In fact, I would say we're comfortable with kind of the midpoint of that range for this year. So that's really the numbers we're looking at for this year. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business. Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a gross margin, again, I mean it's dynamic. Five-tenths of a margin point is difficult to get right every quarter. I do think that we have some lumpiness in revenue as well as margins ahead. Customer mix and product mix will be up and down. The Q1 result was very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we put out there. I do think the 63% for the year is not out of the question. However, I think it's prudent for us to plan the P&L and focus on earnings growth even with margin headwinds continuing. So that's really what we're basing a lot of our guidance on now. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I want to just add to that. I completely agree with everything Ken just said. When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now. Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky. With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins. And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case. So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just check on cloud revenue. You guys had said I think your target was 24% of company revenue by 2019, and obviously you've blown through that, assuming it's the same basis that we're talking about. So is it the same basis, I guess? And then if it is, what sort of longer-term target do you have for a proportion of the company revenue given the trajectory? And then along the same lines, could you talk about that cloud revenue this year? The disclosure shows it sequentially increasing every quarter last year. Is that likely to be the case again this year? Can you just kind of help us understand what you expect from the trajectory there? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline. I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful. Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy. The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness. But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect. The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical. How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And as it relates to our baseline, you have the numbers right. So we disclosed 19%, moving to 24% of our revenue. That would be a growth rate of 10% to 13%. We did recast the verticals, and the Cloud vertical actually is now up a couple points. So actually the 19% turns to 21% of our business in 2015 with cloud. So the target would move up a couple points as well to 26% of our business. Growth rate targets remain the same. However, we are seeing higher pickup in the cloud than we expected, so we're clearly outpacing those growth rates at this point in the model. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And I hate to follow-up on another cloud question. But as we're now focused on that vertical, and we can see the dynamics separately in your results, I'm curious if you could help us understand the concentration or the diversification rather of your customer base within that vertical and how you would characterize your visibility in that vertical relative to your traditional service provider or Enterprise vertical? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. We can talk about the cloud all day long, because it really is such an important vertical for us, and it's a very deliberate part of our strategy, so no problem at all, Aaron. First, when you think about the cloud opportunity, I want to emphasize again that it really touches every vertical that I'm talking about the cloud opportunity all up. There are certainly those that were born in the cloud, the large cloud providers. There are those that have aspiration to become cloud providers. Think of the telcos and the cable operators that are now re-architecting their networks to deliver cloud services. And then there are those enterprises that see the value in moving workloads and applications to the cloud. All of these are an element of our cloud strategy. The way in which we approach each can vary a little bit. So, for example, our large cloud provider customers have an ability to do a lot of the software developments on their own, but then we developed really innovative technologies like Contrail, our SDN controller, to essentially help automate and secure cloud for the enterprise and for the telco and cable space. That's just to say that all of these verticals really apply. Now if the question is specifically around, sort of, our ability to predict the performance, our performance in the cloud provider vertical itself, I think any one quarter, a quarter here and there you're going to see lumpiness, you're going to see variations in the performance just based on their appetite to spend and where they are in certain projects and certain deployments. But generally speaking, when we talk to them, when we see industry reports, when we understand their own plans, and when we see their own performance, I mean, you see how they are performing in their respective markets, we feel good about the fact that they will continue to rely on networks as a foundation of their business, and we also feel good about our ability to satisfy their networking requirements. It's a very competitive environment, but I feel very confident in our technology. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. The majority of the Q&A has been focused on the products and the new segments, which is fair. Now that we're getting towards the end of the conference call, could you touch briefly on Security? I don't think I heard it mentioned how should we view the Security segment within Juniper and kind of the trajectory, it's been kind of a rough last year in Security division when we look about year-over-year growth. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Jim. So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers. And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market. I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence. That's where the effort is. The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio. So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies. If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised. That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus. So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And my follow-up, the turnaround for the sustainable revenue growth, you mentioned a lot of effort into it. When shall we see the fruit of those efforts start to bear? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now. The newer products are growing. The older products are declining. The math is not working for overall growth. This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much for the details. Greatly appreciated. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami, Ken. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hello. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. I have a bigger-picture question, Rami, which is Juniper and Arista are comparable in market cap now. I mean my view is how would you benchmark productivity per employee versus your peers such as Arista who have significantly lower head count versus Juniper. And then also any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security to just improve overall fundamentals, better allocate resources to the more productive product portfolio? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, Vijay, I mean I'll just say that we understand that we operate in a competitive environment. We have competitors that are larger. We have competitors that are smaller than us. The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that. The new products that we have now delivered into the market space, especially in the domain of the PTX routing, in our QFX switching, in the new MX line-cards that we have introduced are all essentially doing as we expected. They're growing nicely across our key verticals, and that's what you can expect more from us in the future. I think there was a second part of the question that I've now forgotten. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. The second part of the question was, any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security and then pouring the resource into product portfolios that are selling in the market? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I appreciate that question. Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses. I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business. The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good. The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve : A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security. And then there is the revenue synergies on top of that. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Maybe we could touch on the services business for a minute and talk a little bit. It sounds like renewal and attach rates have been pretty strong for last few quarters here. Understanding it was a catch-up in the quarter. But could you just talk a little bit about sustainability of the success there? Can we expect this to keep kind of outgrowing products? And then also related to that, how we should think about gross margin leverage as that business continues to grow? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question. So the service business continues to be a highlight for us. It's a very healthy business for us. On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well. As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet. So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year. But I do expect Security after you normalize \u2013 I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business. From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters. It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective. Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next question, please. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Ken, just a housekeeping, book-to-bill if you haven't given it. And then a broader question on Security. Rami, if you could \u2013 press release cites some weakness in high-end SRX. If you could talk about that a little bit and then the opportunity in virtual SRX it looks like you put some marketing dollars behind that recently. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken. The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space. And that part of the business is just going to be lumpy. It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers. The other thing is we have not yet refreshed that part of our portfolio for some time, but we're working on a roadmap to do so that I think will eventually contribute to that business. The virtual SRX, I mean that's a that's an example of how we think about our strategy on a couple of different time horizons. There is the here and now and how our customers are typically building out their security posture today. And then there is what we expect in the future. Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important. And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution \u2013 the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time. It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On the book-to-bill question as our business continues to evolve, and preferred revenue (45:33) grows over time, we believe the commentary around preferred revenue (45:34) is a more meaningful demand metric. So we decided not to disclose book-to-bill any more on a quarterly basis. We will be disclosing backlog on an annual basis going forward in addition to the deferred revenue details. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And as we said, Jayson, that's in line with our peers in terms of that book-to-bill metric, disclosing that metric. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Couple of things I want to ask. One is, in the release, you talk about, I guess, some problems you had with a particular product and some COGS reversals. Could you elaborate a little bit on what happened there, and whether or not that affected any revenue, whether it caused any delays, and how you're remediating that in terms of timing? And then the thing I was trying to understand and back to the cloud, I'm wondering if your cloud vertical has a similar mix, or how the mix compares relative to your overall in terms of percent of revenue coming from Routing, Switching and Security? How does that mix look for the cloud vertical in particular? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one. Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud. Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy. And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing. A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching. But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing. In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So historically, what we talked about is the cloud vertical mix was largely in line with the Juniper overall mix. So Routing, Switching, Security as Juniper goes, the cloud vertical is largely moving that. As we're seeing more success in Switching, we are seeing some of that mix shift towards Switching faster in that vertical than some of the other verticals. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I believe that you are referring to... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'm sorry, on the cost, the cost COGS, cost of goods sold information, sorry, on the GAAP results, I think you're talking about a supplier component remediation cost that we had, and it actually started in Q4. We are working with our customers and a third-party supplier. There are certain products we have a clock signal component defect. This is kind of an industry-wide fairly well known situation. We did take a charge in Q4 and we trued up that charge this quarter. We do believe we're handling it very effectively with our customer base and managing through this situation. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And has that affected your revenue at all? Have you pushed out any sales because of that? That was what I was trying to get at? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, no. It did not have an impact on revenue. It's really more about a proactive approach we're taking to make sure it doesn't have an impact on customers from a quality perspective. We have not seen any actual quality issues to date, but we want to make sure we avoid those going forward and it has not had any impact on revenue. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the clarification. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of wondering on kind of the QFX family, I know it was up 50% this quarter year-over-year. How do we think about the refresh cycle there? And how long should this kind of outsized growth last? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large. And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it. The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option. Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more. This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out. And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good. Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster. And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification here, did you guys comment on the cloud with respect to, is it accretive to the model from a gross margin or operating margin perspective? Just kind of curious if gross margin is lower, but maybe on the operating margin side is better? And then my actual question is, Rami, I want to get a sense here just given the greater transparency around the cloud business and the better momentum, is this why back in early March, you announced the expanded organizational focus related to R&D with Kevin and Andy? Does this really mean you need to have a little more focus in terms of servicing your legacy customers, but also your cloud customers from a technology roadmap perspective longer term? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Let me start on the organizational piece. I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical. I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity. As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level. We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization. And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And from a cloud vertical margin perspective, I would just state that from a gross margin perspective the primary driver within the cloud vertical will be product mix, not the cloud vertical itself. So as it shifts more towards Switching which is what we're seeing now and what we kind of expect to see for the rest of the year that would have a detriment to the telco vertical as an example which is predominantly Routing. But it's not because of the customer itself, it's really more the product mix going into that vertical. From an operating margin perspective, we really don't take the operating margin down to vertical. Most of our cost, most of our OpEx is really shared across all our verticals, we don't segregate it between vertical. So you would see the same \u2013 if you were to allocate it out, you would see a similar profile in the op margin as you would on the gross margin, because everything else would be relatively equally and revenue proportionate. I would say, although it is, as the shifts to Switching, you're seeing some margin pressure there, it's very healthy margins. We're very comfortable with the cloud vertical and the mix within the cloud vertical, and in fact that we are ahead of schedule in some of our transitions into the high performance Switching into that vertical, and that's really a good thing overall. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. What (53:56) answer couple of longer term strategic questions. First, how do you think about \u2013 back to a question Simona asked earlier on the call about the ability to choose between Switching and Routing. How do you think about the opportunity for things like virtual routing et cetera and how does that impact your business strategy (54:17). And then second thing is, in terms use of capital, where does your acquisition strategy stand today, or how does that fit within your use of capital. And then my last question, just on operating expenses, obviously, you continue to control those very well. How should we think about the development of OpEx going forward? Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks James. Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly. You can tell me if I didn't. First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security. There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware. Typically, these are going to be more service oriented. They're going to be at the edge of the network. It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products. And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically. It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past. Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that. It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper. Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in. And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today. So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets. We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today. And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we're very pleased with our Q1 OpEx results which came in below the guidance despite the annual reset of variable compensation and kind of typical seasonal patterns in fringe costs. We're very, very happy with our performance. We are targeting 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the year, which is in line with our long-term target, but actually ahead of schedule. So we're also very pleased with that OpEx discipline going forward. We're always looking to drive efficiencies, but it's beyond efficiencies. We're also looking to make sure we align our workforce to our long-term strategy and make sure that we're able to deliver growth going forward as well. So we believe we could accomplish all of those objectives of keeping expansion in mind throughout the way. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You guys got them all. Sorry about the bad connection. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No problem. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, James. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank each of you for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter. Total revenue was $1.309 billion at the high end of our guidance range, with growth driven by record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical. We delivered strong profitability metrics, with year-over-year growth in operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance as we continued to benefit from our diversification strategy. We're executing on our strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud, and I'm happy with the continued strength in our cloud-oriented solution across our key focus verticals. Enterprises continued towards digital transformation by adopting hybrid cloud and SaaS models. Top of mind for many of our customers are security and visibility of data and workloads in a multi-cloud environment. Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility. In the quarter, we unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking to accelerate agility and innovation in the cloud era. Cloud-Grade Networking builds on carrier-grade reach and reliability and enterprise-grade control and usability, bringing cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks everywhere. This announcement includes two new foundational products : Junos Node Slicing and Universal Chassis, which reduce operational overhead and create an environment for operational agility to thrive. Junos Node Slicing is a critical technology in the transition to Cloud-Grade Networking and in particular, the movement to disaggregated networking at the edge. By enabling the ability to run multiple isolated services at the edge, combined with a powerful and efficient data plane, service providers and enterprises can optimize their infrastructure while offering differentiated services with enhanced operational and administrative isolation within a single chassis. This is enabled by converging multiple concurrent services on the same physical routing infrastructure. This differentiated technology has already enabled a Tier 1 service provider network win for us, and we expect that we'll have broader impact as our customers learn about its powerful benefits. Universal Chassis is a breakthrough system allowing customers to standardize on a hardware platform across their data center, core and network edge. It is designed to provide customers with the ability to adapt to ever changing business requirements with a common hardware platform that supports a continuum of optimized switching and routing use cases across their network. Universal Chassis can create significant value for our customers by enhancing their ROI through reduced qualification and logistics cost along with greater investment protection. Now, I would like to summarize the highlights across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we saw continued momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals. Two effects continued to see strong year-over-year growth in cloud data center, driven by the industry's migration towards 100-gigabit infrastructure and as our customers adopt end-to-end solutions with Juniper's ToR and spine portfolio. We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products. In Routing, the MX had good year-over-year and sequential growth. And we also saw strength in our PTX products within our cloud customers and new insertions in telecom in the second quarter. In Security, we announced enhancements to our Software-Defined Secure Networks platform and expanded our public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0. Our SDSN enhancements deliver pervasive security across multivendor environments, public clouds and private cloud. Juniper's SDSN platform and its ecosystem help organizations unify security for their networks, giving customers a streamlined way to integrate products and manage their security operation regardless of the vendors they choose. In addition, we continue to add new logos to our Sky ATP customer portfolio. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including a large Strategic Enterprise customer in APAC and a large telecom customer in EMEA. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management of Juniper's hardware and software. This allows us to bring the powerful machine-learning capabilities of AppFormix to our entire portfolio of products, and we are now applying this capability in various customer use cases. We had another strong quarter in our services business, where we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. To summarize, I'm pleased with our execution and the continued momentum we are seeing in our Cloud vertical and our Switching business. I am proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio and excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. We saw good momentum in the first half of the year, and we anticipate delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also wanted to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to successfully execute on our strategy and create value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter of 2017 reflect good sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, continued expansion of earnings and healthy cash flows. The industry shift towards cloud networking continued to play to our strengths. The Cloud vertical grew 32% year-over-year, and from a product perspective, we had a record revenue quarter in Switching led by the QFX product family. In addition, our Services business remained solid, posting 9% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong renewal and attach rates. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. These revenue results reflect the focus and dedication we have made toward diversification of our revenue across technologies, markets and geographies. Moving on to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP product gross margin was down year-over-year primarily due to three factors. First, customer mix as we continued to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly with cloud and telecom customers in Asia Pac. Second, product mix, primarily related to the strong performance of Switching. And finally, as expected, the higher cost for certain memory components. We continue to see year-over-year strength in non-GAAP service gross margin due to higher service revenue and continued improvements in our customer support model. For the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $496 million, reflecting our continued discipline around operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.07 year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. I am pleased with the healthy cash flow from operations in the quarter of $299 million, which brings our first half cash flow from operations to $844 million. DSO was 52 days, reflecting a return to normalized invoicing linearity. We continue to return capital to shareholders, and during the second quarter, we repurchased $125 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined at the beginning of the year, which are : we expect revenue growth for the year, we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and intend to maintain an optimized capital structure. In addition, we remain committed to delivering strong operating cash flow. We continue to expect revenue growth for 2017 to be near the midpoint of our long-term model range of 3% to 6%. As I shared with you last quarter, some elements of our addressable markets are challenged, and timing of customer deployments may vary. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from the Cloud vertical. For the remainder of 2017, we expect similar gross margin dynamics as seen in the first half of the year. We are focused on driving non-GAAP earnings expansion for the full year through revenue growth, operating expense discipline and strong execution. As we stated last quarter, we are driving to our long-term model of 39% of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Ken, if I could just on the Switching strength in gross margins, just talk a little bit about what it would take to get those a little bit more towards the corporate gross margin levels. There are some switch companies that are at these levels for their product gross margins. So is it scale? Is there something else that needs to happen? Do we need to see more software features? If you could just talk a little bit about how we can see Switching maybe over time become less of a drag to the corporate gross margin. Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. So, yeah, as we mentioned the product mix to Switching has had a drag on the overall gross margin. Clearly Switching continues to outpace our long-term model expectations. And while the over-performance is having a positive effect on gross profit and overall earnings, it does have a minor impact in our margin. As far as getting the margins up, it's like all of our products, continuing to innovate, continuing to sell that innovation, continuing to focus on cost, is what \u2013 designing for cost, designing for value initiatives, as well as just making sure that we focus on what matters to our customers from a product differentiation perspective. I do think there will be more and more service \u2013 sorry, software attach within all of our product lines including Switching. So that should also provide some tailwinds for the Switching business going forward. Last but not least, I would say even with these kind of margin (15:05) dynamic that we're seeing, we're very focused on overall growth, profit expansion and earnings expansion. I'm very pleased that we're able to deliver that in the first half and Q2. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just had I guess a couple of questions for you. One is on the growth rate that you're suggesting for the full year and then Q3. Just looking at the Cloud, Telecom and Enterprise verticals and thinking about the trajectory of growth in all of those, it seems like you're implying a pretty material slowdown on a year-over-year basis in one or a couple of those. So I just wonder if you could give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of growth for those sub-segments that you've been starting to report. And then the second question I had was on gross margin. Can you just give us maybe, Ken, a little bit of an understanding of those three elements that you listed out on what their impact was quantitatively? Particularly, interested in memory price impacts on gross margin. Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Good. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Actually, Rod, let me start. And then Ken, why don't you weigh in? So on the first question around growth, goes without saying we're pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year. We're off to a strong start for 2017. It certainly gives us confidence that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth and earnings growth in 2017 all up. Having said that, with respect to the specific verticals, remain optimistic about Cloud vertical. A lot of focus inside the company at maintaining the momentum in the Cloud. However, we've always said that the Cloud vertical is going to have some lumpiness. There's going to be a timing of deployment factor that we need to weigh into our overall outlook on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Telco, it's going to be more of the same. I think nothing really changes all that much either in the positive or the negative direction. The engagement level with our telco customers is very high. And it's all very much around new architectures, new ways of driving service revenues, et cetera. But the new mode of operation, the new build-out that drive these new modes of service delivery are just going to take some time. So we're not expecting anything materially different in the short term. Enterprise, there actually in Q2, we saw some good momentum with the exception of the federal government. And there, we have to see how the federal government spending plays out for the rest of the year. But generally speaking, we've done a good job in compensating for weakness in federal government with the broader enterprise. So all up, we remain optimistic about the year, and we're off to a solid start in achieving both revenue and margin growth for the full year. Go ahead, Ken. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'll touch on gross margin, but before I do, I just want to talk about federal government for a second. It was up sequentially. We did see year-on-year decline in federal government. So Rami's comments about the broad enterprise really carrying the day from a year-on-year perspective is spot on. But we did see some sequential growth in the federal government space in Q2. On a gross margin perspective, the three factors that we outlined last quarter are the same three factors this quarter. It really is customer mix, as we expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly in telco, cloud in Asia Pac region. The second one being product mix, as I already talked about the Switching being a very profitable business for us. Obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of that technology. It does come with a slight drag to the margin percentage. And last but not least was the DRAM memory pricing, you mentioned, Rod. We don't break out the exact specifics, but I can say that all three were relatively proportionate and they're kind of factors as headwinds to margin. The one that was probably a bigger headwind than we anticipated when we set the midpoint of the guidance, the one that's the reason why we're on the low end of the guidance, if you will, would be the customer mix. We definitely saw some opportunity to take down some deals, expand our footprint in certain parts of the world that we think are going to be in the long term best interests of the company. And given that we're able to deliver the revenue and earnings expansion that we were focused on, we went ahead and did that in Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get one quick clarification and then more of a general thematic question. In terms of my \u2013 the thing I want to clarify is it appears you've given us implied Q4 guidance, since we have Q3 and a full year bogey at sort of the midpoint at 3% to 6% range. And that would imply that Q4, we would see perhaps a slight year-over-year decline in revenue of 1% or 2%. I just want to make sure I'm doing my math correctly. And if so, it would really help us get an understanding of why you see that kind of year-over-year deceleration. In terms of a more thematic question, I want to delve a little bit into the longer-term trends of Routing. This quarter was relatively flat year-over-year. And it does appear that within your mix, that 2017 Routing is probably going to decline overall and was a little flat \u2013 or roughly flat in 2016. When do you expect the routing market for you and for your headers to turn more sustainably positive and begin to grow again, because we believe traffic continues to grow? Could you help us understand that longer term trend in Routing as well? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Simon. I'll start with the question about Routing. And then we'll address the first question or the point of clarification you're asking about. The routing market is largely driven by the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical. And those are a little bit of a tale of two cities right now where the Cloud is really spending quite a bit on their wide area networks, making sure that their customers for their Cloud services continue to get the optimal experience. And that involves investments in their wide area network. That's somewhat offset by weakness in the Telco vertical, all up, which is obviously significant factor in Routing. So yes, traffic is growing. But there are sort of other factors at play that results in Routing from a revenue standpoint or total addressable market standpoint not growing all that well. Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us. But that said, we're doing everything we can right now to participate in those new modes of spend when they become a reality in the market. The last thing I would say about Routing is there is a big geographic component to this. China is a country that's still investing quite heavily in routing today. They're driving a lot of the world's sort of wide area traffic growth. And in order for us to participate effectively in that market beyond the level that we are today, we need partnerships. And there is a, as you know, quite a bit of focus right now by the company on creating partnerships such as the one that we have with Lenovo today, that will enable us to tap into that market as effectively as possible. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, from a second half revenue perspective, as you know, our revenue is largely deployment based, and therefore, it tends to be pretty lumpy. We did provide specific guidance for Q3 at $1.320 billion, which is up approximately 3% year-on-year. We did not provide Q4 guidance as you mentioned, but we did reiterate that we expect to be within our range, and in fact, near the midpoint of that range. I will say Q4, we expect clearly to be sequentially up. We did have a strong first half this year and we had a pretty strong second half last year. So the year-on-year growth rates, I would expect to decelerate in the second half as compared to second half of 2016. But I do still expect sequential growth and to be comfortably within our target of 3% to 6% kind of near that midpoint area. Operator : Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Yes. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point. So as you mentioned, Ken, you did reiterate the full year guidance at the midpoint, which implies Q4 revenue down 1.5%. And given that just the growth in services alone is going to get you a couple of points of growth for the company as a whole, it does imply a more significant year-over-year decline in products revenue in Q4. So I guess the question is, is that just conservatism sitting here today in July? Or do you have specific visibility into that quarter? And then the quick other question I had is, as far as your 10% customer, if you can tell us what vertical that customer was in? Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism, I would characterize it as appropriate. There's a lot of factors to go into our guidance, clearly deal visibility, backlog, deferred revenue, et cetera. And I would also reiterate that we said near the midpoint, so between 3% to 6% is our long-term target. We expect to be near the midpoint. And I still think that will hold true going into Q3 and Q4 when we get to the full year of near midpoint. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And just to add some color on the first question, Simona, I appreciate the question. Juniper has always been a company that has derived much of its success by focusing on those that operate the world's largest, most scalable networks. And that's certainly true for our service provider on our Cloud vertical. So, in some sense, due to reasons of strategy where we're focusing as a company, where our strengths lie, and the concentration of where spend is happening in our industry, concentration in our business is not new. I think the timing of deployments just so happened that resulted in a little bit more concentration than usual in the Q3 timeframe. I'm not prepared at this point to provide any additional details just for reasons of confidentiality about the specific customer though however. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you hear me? My question is kind of around the question that we had before. How much of the conservatism in 3Q and 4Q, or maybe 4Q, is related to lower visibility with the big trends that you had in the past few quarters? If I look at the past few quarters, I can generally characterize it by quarters of strong Security \u2013 sorry, strong Switching, sorry, strong Switching and strong Cloud vertical. If you're guiding for Q2 to be down, or implicit guidance, does it mean that you have less confidence with these two big drivers? And can you elaborate on the sustainability of growth trends within these two drivers? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So, Tal, I appreciate the question. We're just off to a really solid start this year. I think, as you saw in the Q2 timeframe, we sort of hit the high end of our revenue range. Part of that had to do with sort of just timing of deployments of big projects that we have been working on. There is no change to our confidence in terms of our strategy, our ability to execute, our products that we have in the market today and the products that we're working on that we know that will be out in the market in the future. And also our vertical focus, so the Cloud vertical continues to be a really important vertical for us. I don't think that there's going to be any material slowdown in terms of their need to invest in their networks to keep ahead of the traffic that they are seeing on a yearly basis. But we just have to factor into all of this the timing of those deployments and the timing of the projects. And I think you also mentioned Switching. Obviously very happy with the Switching performance that we have demonstrated well ahead of our long-term model. I think we've said in the past, and I'll say it again just now, that expecting that level of ongoing outperformance at Switching is probably unrealistic only because the numbers start to get big. But that said, the new products are doing really well. Our customer adoption is excellent. The feedback that we're getting from our customers and our partners is also very, very encouraging and there is a lot more room for us to grow and take market share in the Switching business. Operator : Our next question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, I was hoping you could help us understand the breadth of the strength you're seeing with the QFX and particularly, the spine portfolio, and perhaps how you're feeling about the sustainability of the trends we've seen the last few quarters. And would you expect Switching to grow sequentially through the year? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could maybe comment to what degree your cost structure changes as the cloud becomes a bigger piece of your mix. And perhaps, what gives you confidence you can continue to grow the business over time while only marginally increasing the pace of investment? And to the extent you do need to spend a little bit more, where do you see the greatest priorities? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Jeff. Let me start. On the question around Switching, we have expected and we have seen that Switching is in fact the main growth driver for the business. I expect that to continue with the comment I just mentioned around the fact that expecting these levels of outperformance relative to our long-term model in Switching to \u2013 at some point they're going to moderate. But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus. All of that I would say is working really, really well for us right now. And on the point around spine switches, the main intent of our spine switching products has been to enable us to participate in and compete for net new Switching business, especially in the data center. And that's exactly what they're doing. So even in opportunities where we're coming in with the spine switches and, of course, our top of racks, the bulk of the revenue that we'd see could be in other areas of our portfolio like in the top-of-rack switching but we would not have an ability to compete or to win without the breadth of that portfolio. So it's as expected and we're very pleased with the momentum thus far. And I think it will continue in terms of being a growth driver for us for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And as it relates to the cost structure, as the shift to the cloud momentum continues, I would say, I mean, the first thing I'll note is we have a highly leveraged R&D organization. So Routing, Switching and Security is highly leveraged across most of our engineers and what they bring to market in those areas. We'll continue that leverage and the cloud is really \u2013 as we deliver products to the cloud, it should be right in our sweet spot of Routing, Switching and Security. So there's a tremendous amount of leverage there. From a go-to-market perspective, we already have, as you can see from the results, a very successful strategy in winning with the cloud providers and the go-to-market coverage model there is actually quite efficient as compared to, let's say, a broad channel coverage model as an example. So that's something that we'll continue to see going forward. From a, would will we invest more, I mean, there's a lot of areas, a lot of emerging technology areas that we're continuing to invest in now. And I could see that investment step up over the years as we continue to evolve into new architectures, new kind of software areas of focus that we've been talking about for quite some time. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about product cycle. I know that in late June you launched your Cloud-Grade Networking platforms. I'm just curious of how we should think about the cadence of that product cycle? And when do you believe and how material do you believe that product cycle should be maybe looking out over the next couple of quarters? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Aaron. Let me address that. So Cloud-Grade Networking includes a number of different sub-products. One of them is really around this concept of a Universal Chassis. Ken just talked about how we as a company are operating and executing with far more efficiency. It's true in our engineering group, it's true in other parts of our organization as well. Well, one of the ways in which we're achieving that is by developing fewer products that address a broader market opportunity. This concept of a Universal Chassis has the ability to address a number of routing or switching use cases. And it adds tremendous value for our customers because it gives them an ability to evolve their deployments, their investment protection to address a variety of different use cases as their business requires it. The Universal Chassis, the first iteration of it is in the market today. It's a product that supports both routing and switching, and eventually will also support edge routing capabilities as opposed to just core routing capabilities. And while it's still early, typically these things take a couple of quarters, maybe nine months to get to revenue, I do expect revenue for this first iteration of Universal Chassis in the second half of this year. And of course, the innovation engine continues to crank. So across Routing, Switching and Security, you can expect that there's going to be a number of new products that will continue this ongoing cycle of refreshes, and of course that will help us in maintaining the momentum that we've seen thus far over the last couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I have a couple a (34:49-34:56)... Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, James, you're cutting in and out. We can barely hear you. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Is that better? Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, much. Thank you. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just had a couple of higher-level strategic questions. First, with the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, clearly it seems to be enhancing Juniper's Cloud and hyperscale chops, if you will. So I'm just wondering what you hope that Mr. Koley and his leadership will bring to improve like the product portfolio for your traditional Telecom and Enterprise customers. And I guess along the same lines of long-term view, you've talked recently about how you're modifying your Security portfolio. But we've started to see a lot of the private security assets that are in the market snapped up, and with your capital return coming in, I was just wondering if you expect to have to be able to do everything internally or if you still think there's room to acquire new technologies and teams as you continue to develop your security capabilities. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, James, both good questions. First on the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, very, very happy with this hire. Just as a reminder, Bikash hasn't actually joined us yet, but we anticipate that he will in the next month. What he brings to the table are a number of different things, but I'll just sort of summarize it in a couple of different ways. First and foremost, you know that we have over the last couple of years, really honed in our strategy on what we believe is the biggest trend that is impacting our industry. And that is the Cloud. It's by no means saying that this means that it's just around the hyperscalers or the cloud operators. Cloud is in fact an architectural evolution that's becoming a way of life across every vertical that we participate in today. And all of our customers in these verticals, whether they be Telco, Cable, Enterprises, government and of course the hyperscalers are looking for real leadership from a product direction, from a services direction that helps them to make this transition to a cloud architecture that helps them become far more agile and to save money, just as the hyperscale providers have demonstrated can be possible. And of course, Bikash has been a part of that at his current employer, Google. Secondarily, I believe and I've always believed that having real technical knowledge, not just in the products themselves, but in the operation of products and the operations of networks, allow you to develop better solutions for your customers. And Bikash has that as well. I mean, he has now spent a number of years running what is a large network. And that knowhow helps us in developing better solutions, I think, for all of our customer base. Moving on to the question around Security, so yes, we would look to both organic or inorganic. But quite frankly, the focus right now on Security has been on achieving stability and returning to growth. And that means a lot of organic work execution that's necessary to turn around this part of our business. We continue to enhance our product offering with recent emphasis on the enterprise and the mid-range where we actually start \u2013 have started to see some momentum. We are getting positive data points from customers, from partners. We're seeing some geo specific momentum so, whereas, EMEA was a bit of a challenge for us in the Q2 timeframe. Actually there was momentum in Security in EMEA, which gives us some confidence that we're innovating in the right way. And very importantly, Security has become a critical element of some of these future modes of engagements with our customers. So as we talk to our customers around SD-WAN, for example, one of the really differentiating attributes of our SD-WAN solution is that it has Security embedded. So while we're starting to win opportunities in the SD-WAN space, we haven't yet seen the revenue that will help the Security number, which I anticipate we will start to see in the future. Once we get the stability, I think, yeah, there is certainly a possibility for us to start to look at inorganic approaches to accelerate the momentum in our business. But we're taking a deliberate, methodical approach right now to this part of our business. Operator : Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I did want to return back a little bit to the strategic angle, because I think this is the first time in a while when the net cash balance has gone up three times in a row. So it seems like you have quite a lot of flexibility to go after a new asset. So I'm obviously not looking for names here, but can you maybe talk about what type of technology you guys would be interested in at this point? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, so if you look at \u2013 what we've done just historically, we've made a couple of acquisitions in the optical space. We believe there is an architectural inflection point where customers can achieve vast levels of cost efficiency by managing and operating their networks across packet and optical. And then the last one was a company called AppFormix, which is around automation, in particular, in the cloud data center, but has much broader applicability than that. And that would be sort of indicative of what you might expect in the future as well. I just mentioned Security. Even in the domain of Security, I think any sort of inorganic activity that we would contemplate or explore would be more around the new modes of security, not so much of around sort of the physical perimeter firewall which is current mode. New mode is around enabling customers to migrate to public clouds or to hybrid cloud offerings without compromising their data, their users, their workloads. I think, there's quite a bit of innovation right now in the industry in that domain and that would be an area that we would consider as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to build off of the Cloud theme throughout the earlier questions, in terms of understanding dual sourcing. Do you think that Juniper is benefiting from just the general tide rising? Or are you seeing clouds now articulate their dual sourcing or even triple sourcing of certain product? And then, kind of the offshoot of that question is, is your Security portfolio as it stands today, kind of, building off of James's question, is it inhibiting any sort of further penetration at certain cloud accounts because of holes in the portfolio? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Mark, first, I want to understand a little bit more about your first question. When you say dual sourcing, are you talking about the intent of cloud providers to dual source their... Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Two vendors. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: To have, yeah... Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The dual vendors, dual \u2013 two vendors. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. I mean, the Cloud vertical for us is not a new vertical. I mean, we have been in this vertical now for as long as I can remember. And we have been, sort of, intimately tied down at the engineering level with our cloud customers now for a number of years. And it's always been a very competitive environment. So, by no means do I ever feel like there \u2013 that we don't need to be on our toes. We're always having to demonstrate to them how we're innovating in ways that are very, very specific to the kinds of network that they're building out, the operational models that they want to deploy, the telemetry capabilities that they want, et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, some of them do have sort of an internal strategy to go to dual vendor \u2013 dual vendors to procure that technology. But even in those circumstances, our goal is to always get the lion's share by demonstrating that we can perform better or innovate in a more appropriate way for their business. On Security, and I think, the question was around whether we're driving Security products in the Cloud vertical. And that certainly is the case, but I will say that different cloud providers have very different security requirements and security models that they deploy inside of their networks. In some cases, they believe in the big iron that sits at the edge of their data centers, for example, and secures traffic going in and out of those data centers. For that, we have a fantastic product, our high-end SRX. But that business will be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on where the deployments are. In other cases, it's really more around securing through micro segmentation inside of the cloud network. And that's really more around a software approach to security, and that's more of an emerging opportunity for us at Juniper. Operator : Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. I just want to clarify what's the thinking on gross margins. What's the confidence that for the corporate levels that we're at a floor for the long term here (45:02)? Apart from software rising in the mix, the product mix that's going on, what other factors should we think about? I think 62% (45:09) do you think, or are there other factors to think about over the next 12 months? Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we did, obviously, guidance for Q3 at 62.0%, plus or minus 0.5 point. For the full year, I still expect the gross margin to be in that 62% to 63% range that we talked about on the last call. That's really the line what we expect, and we still continue to focus on earnings expansion. And I expect earnings to expand actually at a faster rate than revenue for FY 2017. So that's something we're very focused on for this year, kind of, despite some of the gross margin headwinds that we're seeing. From a longer term, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond this year, but I will say that there's a tremendous amount of focus internally on gross margin. Clearly, it all starts with the right product and innovation and product differentiation. And that's something that Juniper really has historically been our strong suit and that will continue to be our strong suit going forward. So making sure we provide the right products at the right price point is something we'll continue to drive. There's opportunity within our cost structure, we've been working on it for the last couple of years, but I still think there's some opportunity to get our cost structure down particularly in the area of designing for value, making sure that we're spending some of our technical resource on not just features and performance, but also some of the cost drivers that matter to our customers today. And last but not least is the software business, which we mentioned on multiple times. In addition to all this focus on gross margin, we're going to continue to be very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability and that's really what's driving a lot of our business decisions today. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Maybe, Kulbinder, it's worthwhile just summarizing the areas of focus that we currently have with respect to gross margins. First, there is opportunity when it comes to value engineering. And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins. Secondarily, I mean, Ken has mentioned how we've gone after strategic customer insertions in particular in APAC, and we need those to pay off over time. Third, there's innovation. And one of the questions I was just asked around where are you contemplating inorganic moves, one area I did not mention is the area of silicon photonics. The primary reason is because we believe that there is an opportunity there through innovation to achieve better cost of goods sold from an optical standpoint. And last but not least, it's around business models and it's around software. It's around selling the value through Contrail, virtual security, SD-WAN. All of these emerging opportunities I think have the ability to not just help top line, but to also help gross margins. But they're largely going to be gated by how fast the industry moves. Now, we're out there sort of really selling the value to our customers. We're encouraged by the wins that we're getting, but it's sort of the timing of the benefit is not 100% clear at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. I know gross margins has been a key topic, and I think that's because investors are so focused on the year-over-year declines, yet the revenues increases. So revenue's going up which is great. Margin's coming down and is a concern for investors. So I have two questions, one on that and then one just on the Security side. So on the gross margins, are we at a level now where gross margins are going to stop going lower or is it more mix-dependent and they potentially could go lower strategically as you look forward to the future? And I do understand the three things you laid out, but I'm just kind of thinking about this bigger picture. Then my second question is on Security, it was down 12% year-over-year. You laid out some (49:17). How should we think about security going forward? Should we kind of expect that to decline going forward until those holes are plugged? Or why are revenues growing yet your Security is declining? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Jim, let me start with the Security question first. So, I outlined the main areas of focus. I also provided some of the data points that we are now picking up on that give us some confidence that the work that we are putting in is going to pay off for us. I believe the second half and in particular Q4 would be sort of a quarter that I would expect to start seeing some year-over-year growth in the security market. So that's how I view the opportunity right now in Security and how we are expecting the rest of year to pan out. And Ken, do you want to talk a little bit more about gross margins? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So as you mentioned, Jim, there's a balance that we're trying to achieve here. So clearly, revenue growth is one of our highlights for the first half. We were up 9% for the first half, 7% for Q2, 11% for Q1. That did come at a gross margin decrement, but overall, we're growing gross profits. And gross profits really lead to earnings expansion, and that's really where we're focusing as a company. We had very strong earnings expansion in the first half, and I continue to see earnings expansion for the full year. From a where is margin headed, we did talk about 62% for Q3 guidance, because we expect similar dynamics that we saw in Q2 to persist in Q3. And since the revenue levels are similar, we'd expect the margin levels to also be kind of similar in that range. Beyond that, we've already mentioned all the initiatives to work on gross profit going forward and gross margin going forward, but we aren't providing any guidance beyond the FY 2017 kind of color that we've already provided. It's hard to say \u2013 given the dynamic nature, it's really difficult to have visibility into gross margins beyond kind of the next couple of quarters at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. At the risk of never being allowed back in the queue, I've got a couple of questions for you. One, I appreciate all the questions with gross margin, but I've got a very simple question. What is the rate of price erosion year-over-year all in? Secondly, within the Cloud, and I appreciate the mix you've been giving on customers, but within the Cloud segment, can you talk about the mix between Tier 1 cloud titans versus the bulk of the cloud, and also the product mix within Cloud? And finally, the exact 2H, where 2H falls out for the year in terms of revenue, how much of that second half dollars is (52:09) influenced by that 10% customer or I assume somewhat lumpy nature of cloud projects in general? I appreciate it. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Paul, let me start with the second one, the Tier 1 versus broader Cloud. We don't break it out, first of all, but I will say the following. Our penetration in the Tier 1s from a Routing standpoint is one that has been in place now for a number of years. So we've certainly had way more runway and way more of an ability to achieve the kinds of penetration across our Tier 1 Cloud customers in the Routing space more so than we've had on the Switching side of things. In Switching, we view it as more of an opportunity. We certainly have a strong Tier 1 presence in Switching, but we have less market share and penetration than we do in Routing. And, therefore, that's certainly a potential growth area for us. In the meantime, I think what I have said on this call in the past is that there is a broader opportunity in the cloud space, not necessarily with the hyperscalers, but the broader cloud market when you look at SaaS providers, regional cloud providers, telco cloud that's here now that we are benefiting from. I mean, a lot of our business momentum in fact is from that tier of cloud provider. And I think that's a very healthy thing. Price erosion, again, is not something that is easy to describe without a whiteboard and some slides. We can certainly do something like that maybe at our next Analyst Day. But it's the nature of this business that we're in. Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market. So all up, the Routing space is roughly a sort of a flattish type of total addressable market from a growth standpoint, but traffic is growing at 40% plus year-over-year. So that would give you an idea of the price erosion that we're seeing in that market space. In the data center switching side, there of course, there is price erosion just as there is everywhere. However, I think that market is growing at a faster clip than in the data center and that's why we are so focused on data center switching as part of our strategy. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I think you also asked about within the Cloud vertical, the product mix dynamics. And while we don't break out specific products within customer vertical, we have mentioned in the past that the Cloud vertical does have a higher proportion of Switching than say the Telco vertical. That said, it still is predominantly majority of the Cloud vertical is Routing, as most of our revenue is coming from Routing and that applies to the Cloud vertical as well, but we are seeing Switching become a bigger and bigger piece of that overall vertical historically and I think that will continue going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Cisco had some pretty big announcements recently, which I'm assuming you guys looked at and I realize a lot of them are on the campus side, which doesn't affect you. But they did talk about going much more after some of the hyperscalers and having some initial success. They talked about intent-based networking and encryption. I just wondered, kind of, what your analysis is of their products in terms of how perhaps they affect you, both on the positive and the negative side. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. First from the standpoint of hyperscalers, I think we acknowledge that this is a competitive market and especially as we demonstrate the momentum and the success, we can expect that the competitive levels to only intensify. Having said that, I think it really is just a matter of execution for us, execution from the standpoint of how we engage with them, execution from the standpoint of our innovations and on all fronts, I feel good about where we are and where we're going relative to the hyperscaler opportunity, in addition to the broad Cloud opportunity that is before us. And as far as Cisco's announcement, I have been now for two or three years talking about automation as being the next big thing in networking. There's a very important reason for that. If you think about what our customers across every vertical want more than anything else, it is the ability to move fast, to innovate quickly and to do so with a certain level of cost efficiency. You achieve that by first, providing them with innovative Routing, Switching, and Security products that outpace Moore's Law from an economics of traffic movement standpoint. But importantly, considering that most of our customers invest far more in the cost of operations than they do in CapEx, the only way to address that problem is through automation. And for that reason, we've always had a lot of automation capabilities across our platforms, whether it be the automation capabilities of our systems themselves, the API driven nature of those systems, Contrail has a way of automating Cloud operation, AppFormix has an ability to provide machine learning capabilities to create visibility inside of a Cloud data center, our NorthStar Controller is essentially an automation platform for our wide area. So I think it's good to see our peers in the industry recognize the importance of this trend, and it has been and will continue to be a huge area of focus for us. Operator : Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much. I was hoping to stick with Switching a little bit. I think in the past, you have given us some QFX growth rates as a standalone product family. So I'm wondering if that's feasible and then if you could talk around the dynamics if that's shifting at all and what we should expect going forward. Then the second piece is, EX does end up in some campus environments and that has been up. So, please, help us understand if you think that's sustainable, and that's particularly in light of Cisco's Refresh. Is that likely to impact what you all have going on? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate the question. In Switching, this is pretty consistent with what we've done historically. We don't necessarily break out the performance of all of our specific product lines. And we didn't do that for QFX in Q2. However, I think it's safe to say that we would not be able to post this type of overall Switching momentum without strong QFX performance. So we're very happy with the performance of our QFX product line in the Q2 timeframe. It's a result of a deliberate strategy and some really solid execution by the team, which I am very proud of. EX is more of a campus-focus product, although it does see some data center and combined campus data center type of converged build-outs. And we saw good momentum there in the Q2 timeframe as well. Our primary strategy is on the data center, the Cloud, and these larger enterprises that are building out their campuses as on ramps to the Cloud. And for that, you need a high degree of performance, operational simplicity and automation and I think the EX from all three of those dimensions is an extremely competitive product. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Karen. Thank you all for your great questions. As always I want to thank you for those of you who kept your questions to one per firm. For those who didn't, maybe Paul Silverstein, we will talk with you next quarter. Thanks, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth. Thank you. You may begin. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause the actual results to materially differ are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update information presented on this call if facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. The results we announced today were not the results we set out to achieve for the second half of this year, so let me address that first and foremost. Juniper has always excelled at building the largest, most demanding network in the world. This is both the result of our deliberate strategy and a reflection of where our strength lies. Over the last several years, some of the most mission-critical networks in the world have been built by Cloud providers. I'm very proud of how we have successfully pivoted our strategy to capture that tremendous opportunity and execute it against our innovation road map to grow our relevance and our business in the Cloud vertical. At the same time, having such large and agile customers can lead to significant lumpiness in our business, which we saw in Q3 and expect to continue into Q4. Let me provide some insight on our current work with these large Cloud providers. First, as you know, we have built substantial footprint with these companies over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close surround and support of these customers as they've grown. As their growth continues, it is clear that their architectures need to evolve, and we are leading the charge to more modern, cost-efficient, scalable networks. In Q3 and Q4, we are seeing a spending delay as our largest customers prepare to go through this architectural shift. This is not uncommon in our industry, and Juniper has benefited before in leading architectural shift such as with the Converged Supercore and data center fabrics. What's most important is that we are maintaining our strong footprint as these shifts unfold. We continue to challenge the status quo, and that approach is only making us more relevant with our most important customers, even if it sometimes has a short-term disruptive impact. While we're disappointed with our revenue and earnings performance in Q3, we're confident that we've made significant progress in establishing a strong footprint developing the right products and executing on an innovative product pipeline. Now I'd like to summarize the performance across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we're disappointed with our overall revenue decline in Q3. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyper-scale customers due to the spending delay I mentioned, our QFX product line continued to grow at double-digit rates, both sequentially and year-over-year. It continues to grow across public and private Cloud segments driven by 100-gig adoption, our innovation and automation in telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our Fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operation. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including Cloud and hyper-scalers. In Routing, our business grew sequentially and declined year-over-year in a dynamic environment. Our PTX product line continued to gain traction, and in fact, achieved a record revenue quarter in Q3 as our customers have embraced its unique attributes for core build-out. The success of the PTX product line is evident in the most recent IHS Markit share report that for the first time ever showed Juniper in first place position in North America core Routing market share over the last 12 months. Additionally, we saw Routing growth in APAC, both sequentially and year over year. In Security, our business grew sequentially driven by momentum in the data center, service provider and next-gen firewall sales. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q3 that are leveraging its benefits. During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Cyphort, a leader in automated malware analysis and detection. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including Strategic Enterprise customers in APAC and a Canadian service provider, as well as recurring revenues from renewal of existing annual subscription. We also unveiled Contrail Security, an important addition to Juniper's Security portfolio. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product road map for Contrail that should result in an expansion of its used cases across a broader set of customers. Additionally, AppFormix's customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprises, and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases. In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services resulting in year-over-year growth. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the Cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing Cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm also delighted to have on board our new CTO, Bikash Koley, who has firsthand knowledge and experience in building and operating large-scale Cloud networks and is now helping us further refine our strategy and sharpen our execution across our entire innovation pipeline. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half expected performance, we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right products and solutions portfolio. I'd like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The financial results for the September quarter were disappointing, with revenue and non-GAAP EPS falling below our expectations. The lower than expected revenue result was primarily due to the timing of certain large switching deployments within the Cloud vertical related to architectural shifts. Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.258 billion, down 4% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Our technologies posted mixed results for the quarter. Routing grew sequentially, but declined year-over-year due to Telecom and Cable deployments. Switching declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the delay of certain large Cloud customer deployments. And Security grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Service revenue continued to be solid, growing 9% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, four were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, one was located outside of the United States. Product deferred revenue was $324 million, up $26 million or 9% year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2% year-over-year and sequentially and were 38.5% of revenue. This reflects our continued focus on managing expenses through increased efficiencies and a focus on operational excellence. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.55, down $0.02 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating and other expenses. Cash flow from operations were $202 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to slightly more than $1 billion. We continued to return capital to shareholders. And during the third quarter, we repurchased $140 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. As we have discussed in the past, elements of our addressable market are dynamic; and particularly within the Cloud vertical, change can occur rapidly. Our Q4 revenue outlook reflects continued large deployment delays. As we expect, our largest Cloud customers will continue their architectural transition. Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers. Gross margins are expected to remain at current levels. We expect to continue managing operating expenses prudently and to drive increased operational efficiencies. Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce as we continue to prioritize our investments in the most critical areas of our business. We are committed to returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow and expect to be opportunistic with our share repurchases. Despite the disappointing full year outlook, we are confident in our strategy and remain committed to our long-term financial principles of driving revenue growth, earnings expansion, and an optimized capital structure. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from Brian White from Drexel. Please go ahead. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah, Rami, how do we know this is an architectural shift here at customers rather than increased competition, number one? And if this is some type of delay, do you expect to get this revenue back in 2018? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Well, how you know, I mean, what I'm seeing through the discussions, the engagements that I'm having through our customers, I'll tell you that \u2013 especially our Cloud customers is all around a transition that's happening in switching from 10 and 40-gig to 100-gig. And in wide area networking from what has traditionally been scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures or something that we have called lean core architectures. We're very close to our customer base, especially our Cloud customer base. We've developed many of the products that are in the market today, in particular, the PTX product line with a keen understanding of what \u2013 how these architectural evolutions are going to happen. And honestly, I think the competitiveness of that product is very strong, as you've seen from the results in Q3 with a record revenue quarter for the PTX. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks the fact that we've gained now number one market share in core Routing in North America, and that's primarily because it's been helped by the Cloud provider customers. So I firmly believe that this is a transition where we will emerge on the other side of it. We, in fact, have been leading the charge with the transition. And I think from a competitive standpoint, there's no doubt this is a competitive industry. But because of the products we have and the tight relationships we have with this customer base, I'm very confident. As far as timing, I think that the Switching transition, especially with hyper-scalers, is one that will play out through the rest of this year. And the first part of next year, we should start to see a resumption of more normal spending patterns, especially for the new 100-gig base switching architectures. In Routing, I think it's going to be a bit of a multi-quarter type of transition that's going to happen towards the PTX, towards scale-out architectures. And I think that's all up for next year, Routing is probably going to be a flattish type of business for us. I think that, considering the dynamics that are happening in the market would be a pretty decent result. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to see if, first of all, you could clarify whether or not the customer that slowed down is the same customer that was a 10% customer in the June quarter, and if this could simply be an issue where there was too much inventory built up in June and it takes some time to absorb it. Is that a possible scenario for what's played out here? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we believe that it's a positive for the transition as Rami mentioned. From a customer perspective, I mean, we are pretty heavily engaged with the Telco vertical as well as the Cloud vertical. And there is a pretty high level of concentration in both of those verticals. For us to have these types of results, I think it's pretty evident that it's going to be one of our larger customers and a pretty large deployment that was impacted, and I'll leave it at that. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of the trending, your Cloud, if I did the math correctly, was still 27% of overall sales, so it's still significant. If we want to look past the lumpiness and just think about how you see your business evolving, let's say, over roughly a two-year window, where do you see these vertical mixes coming in terms of maybe \u2013 roughly a two-year outlook? Would you expect that that Cloud vertical turns into a third of revenue, 35% to 40%? What's realistic for how you expect your mix evolve? Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the Cloud vertical has been clearly our growth vertical for the last couple of years, and it's very evident that we believe we're on the right side of change as it relates to that vertical, and we've seen the strong results because of that. Through this transition period, I think we're going to see a little bit of lumpiness as we transition. But as we come out the other side, as Rami mentioned, it's important to note that we believe we are on both sides of this transition. So the pause in the middle is really the most troubling part from a financial perspective. As they start to ramp up with the new architectures, we believe we will be able to grow in the Cloud vertical going forward. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me just double-click a little bit on that, and I'll do it from the standpoint of Routing and Switching. In Routing, we've always enjoyed pretty substantial market share in the Cloud vertical. And I fully expect based on the competitiveness of our products, based on the full understanding that the transitions that are happening right now are going towards architectures that we are enabling ourselves. So to the extent that our \u2013 the Cloud customers themselves are successful and continues to see traffic growth in their wide area network, I think we'll benefit from that. On the Switching side, where we have seen really good traction in Switching has been in Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers. This has been a deliberate part of our strategy. We knew that this would be sort of the lower hanging fruit for us as we introduce the full extent of our Switching portfolio into the marketplace. And then Tier 1 Cloud providers, we do have some meaningful deployments there, but it largely remains an opportunity for us. This is where I believe the opportunity for us over the next couple of years is really going to be strong. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Just two if I could. First, just, Ken, if you could talk a little bit about the gross margins in the quarter. I think you said it was as expected, but my sense is that might have been before the shortfall. We had Switching weakness and Cloud weakness. So why was it only flat? And then secondly, a lot of talk about the Cloud vertical weakness, it looks like the Strategic Enterprise was down pretty meaningful as well. Is that the Cloud portion of the Strategic Enterprise, or maybe if you could just talk to us a little bit about what's going on in the Enterprise business, which also seemed pretty weak? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So from a gross margin perspective, I did mention that we came in in line with our expectations at 62%. And you're right, from a mix perspective that provided us a bit of an advantage because we did see some softness in Switching, which is our lower margin product, but that was offset by the volume. The revenue being down traditionally has an impact to gross margin in a negative way, so we effectively offset the lower revenue volume with a better product mix. From a customer perspective, as we've mentioned in the past, we don't see a significant impact to margin based on vertical. But the more important impact is customer mix within vertical or customer mix overall. So again, to summarize, this quarter was in line. However, we got there a little differently. It was lower revenue, which hurts margin, but higher product mix, because Switching was the revenue miss. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And on the Enterprise side, so we saw some sequential declines but year-over-year slight increase. I think if you break it apart in the broad enterprise market was where the weakness was from a sequential standpoint, but for Strategic Enterprises, for example, banking would be in that sector or government, we actually saw a bit of a recovery. I think the catalyst for Enterprise going forward is going to be around our ability to leverage new architectural approaches, take for example, SD-WAN deployment. The strength that we have and the relationships we have with our Telco customers to reach our broader Enterprise, we have a few wins now that we have established this year that I'm hopeful will start to contribute to Enterprise revenue throughout next year. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Mark, your line is live. Might be on mute by accident. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let's go to the next question, and then we'll come back to Mark. Operator : Okay. We'll go to next question. It's from Pierre Ferragu from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. Rami, thanks a lot for your clarification around this architectural shift at your large Cloud clients. I had a further question with \u2013 on that \u2013 between Switching and Routing, do you see some kind of changes in architecture as well where in places at the higher level of aggregation, for instance, where we had a lot of Routing or in data center interconnect, do you see a shift of that market toward Switching as well? And is that part of the architectural discussions and debate and changes that are happening at your clients? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, Pierre. So it's a great question, in fact. And yes, there is a shift that is happening. It's one that we have predicted and developed products and solutions around. And really, I have been talking about this blurring of the lines that is happening between Routing and Switching. If you look at what's happening to data centers, Cloud data centers in particular, they're getting more distributed. And the interconnect between them is essentially becoming an extension of the fabric that's in the data center. So, we actually saw this happening and understood that there is an opportunity for us to go and capture with a product like the PTX. The PTX, as you think about it is sort of this perfect cocktail of Routing capability from a control plane standpoint, but Switching capability from a data plane and cost efficiency of IP transport. And that has now been adopted by the Cloud providers, and I think will continue to be adopted by the Cloud providers at a pace that quite honestly exceeded our expectation. And this at least partly explains what we're seeing in terms of the Q4 guidance that we're providing. It's that transition from what I described as scale-up to more of a scale-out approach, which speaks to this blurring of switching and routing across Cloud architectures. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. And then maybe a very quick follow-up. So what we definitely learned these days is that your Cloud segment is made of very large clients, and it's a lumpy business like your Telecom service provider business. Now if I take a step back, your Telecom and Cable business is down 4% this quarter. Does that mean that growth \u2013 we should expect growth to come mostly from your Cloud division, and we need to see growth coming back from there, or do you still see growth trend and like the business coming back at some point, so many, many quarter of weak business in the Telecom segment as well? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, I do think that there is a good opportunity to see growth in Cloud all up as we emerged to the other end of this transitions that we are talking about. Telco remains a challenged market environment, right, where we're seeing more of the same in terms of them running their networks hotter, Cloud transformations that are happening in their own networks, consolidation, M&A are all headwinds that we're facing in the Telco space. The catalyst, I believe, for Telco spending will be around preparation for 5G, Metro build-outs that I think are going to start to happen over the next couple of years, new approaches to delivering value to the Enterprise that are more virtualized and software nature like SD-WAN. And we've really architected our SD-WAN strategy around enabling the telcos to go after that opportunity. So for the foreseeable future, we're not counting on any sort of meaningful rebound in Telco, but I think a little bit more longer term, there are going to be some catalysts that I think will help us. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. It's Jim Suva from Citi. You both mentioned Security grew quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which is good. But looking back, it looks like that's the normal trend. So my question to you is, are you trying to signal or let us know that you expect this trend to continue quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, the results look quite challenged? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Jim. So yes, I do expect that the sequential momentum is going to increase. And there are a few things around the Security business that give me some confidence right now. And we're not out of the woods. We're still working very hard to turn this part of our business around, but there is a sequential performance that we've seen through this year. There is the feedback and the wins that we have from our customers. And we're starting to see some pretty meaningful wins that are building some bookings performance that are encouraging. There is a diversity of use cases that we're now satisfying. So we've traditionally been strong in the service provider space. The portfolio for the service provider space has quite frankly suffered over the last year or so. It's now coming back to a much more competitive state, but we also are starting to see traction with next-gen firewall and data center. And then last but not least, I think there is the software attach, the license attached to Security is actually starting to pick up, and that is a pretty good sign. So we remain optimistic around the fact that we can make this sort of the worst year, and we can recover from here going forward. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, just to clarify that, I mean, our definition of success is sustained year-on-year growth. We have not yet achieved that. We're not yet trying to signal that we're happy with sequential growth, and that's all you could expect. We are absolutely turning this business around and expect to get to year-on-year Security growth here in the near future. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sounds great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first one is on Switching. I'm trying to understand how much of this is also \u2013 maybe there's an aspect of competitiveness. Did you notice, with the same customer, maybe another vendor gaining share at the same time? Is the challenges you're talking about architecture? Does it cause \u2013 does it drive someone else to gain share in the interim? Or were things put on hold? Also, does it have anything to do with your product readiness for what the customer is trying to do? Is there anything on your side you need to do to make things work? Or is it simply just the customer? And the second question I have is, in general, why don't you grow your margins more than where you are? The industry is challenging. Routing is under pressure for many years. Security, you do have some issues, but you're working on it. In times like that of challenges, why don't you work on reducing your expenses to deliver higher margins to investors and maybe compensate for the lower growth rate? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay, so let me start with the question on Switching. There is no doubt that the Switching environment is a very competitive environment. Having said that, where we have footprint, I believe, we're well entrenched. We're very close to our customers. We understand their requirements very well, and there are barriers to entry. And this is in no means trying to project overconfidence because I sort of subscribe to the notion that only the paranoid survive. But I will say that I'm very confident that we're going to maintain our Switching footprint in our large franchises, and we will be on the other side of this transition as they move towards (30:18) architectures. From a product standpoint, we know what's required. We know what performance levels are needed, the telemetry capabilities that are required, the features that are needed. And I'm bullish about our Switching business all up in the future. On operating margins, I will let Ken jump in here, but I will say the following. I mean, we have streamlined our organization. We're running far more efficiently than we have in the past. We're enabling a greater level of leveraging of products across different product lines : Routing, and Switching, Routing and Security as an example of that. We're taking out unnecessary costs when we see that there is an opportunity to do so. So in fact, this is part of the reason why we missed in Q3, but still managed to achieve the low end of our earnings range. And we'll continue to operate in that way. I think this is an important part of delivering shareholder value. Ken? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we actually are quite pleased with our Q3 OpEx results that came in at the low end of our range, actually below our range. We continue to be laser focused. I think you've seen that in the last few quarters, laser-focused on cost discipline and making sure we look to optimize our structure in our operations. Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce, and we're making sure that we're doing that prudently; make sure that we still focus in the right investment areas to drive longer term growth. And you can count on us continuing to focus on earnings, right? We have a stated commitment that we're going to drive earnings faster than revenue. We're going to grow OpEx lower than revenue. I believe we're going to accomplish the OpEx goal of slower than revenue this year despite the fact that the revenue headwinds hit us harder than we expected, we're still being very prudent with OpEx. And for the full year, we will actually be down in OpEx at the midpoint of our guidance. So I do think we are managing the bottom line quite effectively, and we'll continue to do so going forward. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Meta standing in for James. A couple of questions; first, you mentioned a kind of Switching disruption for the next couple of quarters. Would you expect kind of a Routing disruption on the back of that with certain Cloud customers as they change architecture? Or should we not kind of expect any tail to that beyond Switching? And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of \u2013 in your Cloud vertical, what is kind of the general split between Tier 1 and maybe the rest of Tier 2, Tier 3? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. So first, the Routing and Switching transitions that are happening are somewhat related. And it speaks to the color I just provided, I think, to Pierre's question that he asked earlier around sort of the blurring of lines in these architectures. And in Q4, in fact, our guidance that we provided really has sort of a balance of both transitions that are happening, Switching moving to 100-gig, Routing moving to lean core scale-out type architectures, they in some sense do go hand in hand. As far as providing any additional color on Tier 1s and Tier 2 Cloud providers... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, we don't break out customer detail other than a couple of facts that you do have out there. One is five of our top 10 customers are Cloud. So that's an important number. And in addition to that, if you were just to look at the Cloud customers' size and breadth in the world, you will see it's very concentrated on the top 5, 7, 10, whatever you want to categorize it. Our revenues are going to be largely in line with what you would expect, given kind of CapEx spends around the globe. But I don't want to over-rotate on just the hyper-scalers. I mean, obviously, that's where the majority of the spend is, and that's where you could anticipate much of our customer concentration. There is a longer tail in the industry. It's not just about the infrastructure service providers, there's also the SaaS community that we're also very focused on and a broader set of customers around the globe. Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm actually going to focus a bit on the Security side, because you guys mentioned you're investing or buying some kind of security malware functionalities as well. So if I think about your balance sheet now, is that kind of the direction you guys are going to go in, if you go down the M&A front to kind of get differentiated growth outside kind of QFX? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question. So I do think that we've got a healthy balance sheet. And I do view that leveraging that balance sheet in order to buy technology businesses that are very complementary to our strategy very much around Cloud, Cloud Security is an option for us and something that I continue to seriously consider. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just one small one. When should the 100-gig number start to show up? Is that a 2018 story, or is that going to show up at the back half of Q4? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, I \u2013 so a lot of the work to get ready for the transition, the certifications, the architectural work, the qualification work with our customers is happening right now. So I do believe in the first part of next year, we'll start to get to more normal Switching spending patterns with our largest Cloud providers. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Yes. I would like to delve into the margin structure a bit, if we could. Could you update us on a couple of the other variables on gross margin that we might see some improvement over the next few quarters? And particularly, Ken, you've talked about memory pricing. And then, of course, you've talked a lot about some APAC wins as well. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the dynamics overall in margin haven't really changed much. I mean, we still see the primary drivers to be kind of customer mix. We've talked about insertion opportunities. In Q3, we had some follow-up from the activity that we talked about in the first half, but we didn't have any new large insertion deals that were actually margin negative in Q3. It was just really completing some of the deals that we entered into in the first half. So there wasn't a big factor in Q3. The memory pricing is still a headwind. It's an industry phenomenon. It's impacting us, and that's something that's in line with our expectations. As far as when does it come back, I don't see it coming back in Q4. We're not providing guidance on FY 2018, but I would think it's reasonable to assume sometime in 2018, we'll start to see a little bit of relief on the memory price. And then the product mix is also the dynamic that we experienced a lot. And as Switching continues to be a growth driver for us that will result in a natural kind of headwind to margin. That being said, we're very focused internally on some value engineering efforts. But we think we have a lot of opportunity within our cost and supply chain to really design our products in a way that really provides the most customer value at the right price point and at the right cost structure. So I believe we have some of that within our control, and we'll continue to manage margins, despite some natural headwinds with product mix. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : You talked a little bit about insertion point, and I'm just \u2013 and we hear from others that 100G is indeed an insertion point for their products in existing \u2013 or in new accounts. It seems though you are talking about 100-gig as a pause rather than a potential insertion point. And so I'm a little surprised by the disparity there. I would have thought that that was an opportunity for a customer to start with a new set of vendors. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So, this is Jeff, I believe, right? Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Yes. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let me say this. There are certainly accounts \u2013 large Cloud accounts that we're in that where the game we're playing or the approach we're taking is one of making sure that we stay ahead of their requirements with a goal of keeping the competition out. And I think we're doing a really good job at that. We also believe that especially for the Cloud Switching space, we can play and are playing a more offensive strategy to try to insert ourselves. Now we're not going to always be successful, but thus far, if you look at the performance of our Switching business, and you modulate out the lumpiness due to the large hyper-scaler deployments, we're still seeing double-digit growth in overall Switching. Some of that comes because of our strength in high-performance in 100-gig, in telemetry, in automation, et cetera. So there is a bit of a defensive game you have to play when you're an incumbent. But I also want you to understand, we're playing a very offensive game, especially in Switching, where I think there's still a huge amount of room for us to expand. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, thank you. I just want to be absolutely clear regarding your comments about footprint. In none of these large situations where you're seeing a lumpy business, a deferral in business, are you being displaced by competitors or by white box? I just want to confirm that. And then given this shortfall on product revenue, should we expect to see a deceleration in services growth somewhere down the line or not? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let me start. The answer to your first question is yes. It's not a displacement by competition. It is \u2013 if anything, we're displacing ourselves with new architectural approaches, and we're doing this ahead of our customer's requirements to avoid being disrupted or displaced by the competition. And I think in the long term, this approach, playing a challenger type of approach where you \u2013 in some cases need to challenge yourself even if it results in short-term business disruption pays off because it makes us more relevant. And I believe it ultimately helps us to grow our footprint. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, from a services perspective, I mean, we expect it to continue to remain very healthy. We've had a very good run in services the last couple of years. We've done a good job with attach and renewals. And we're also starting to do more in the way of professional services and really the solution sale. That said, I do think it's reasonable to assume the growth rates that we've been having, which have been largely double digits, 9%, 10% just start to come down a bit. I still think that growth rates will be ahead of the product growth rates, so high single digits, if you will. But it's something that we continue to be strong for us going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, good afternoon. Yeah. I'd like to get your thoughts, Rami, on the pricing dynamics you're seeing out there. And how I mean by this is management teams often do not talk about port pricing ASPs on earnings calls. It would be helpful for us, you do have a legacy routing portfolio. You have the new stuff with 100-gig, a very similar setup in Switching. So help us understand how is pricing trending both on the lower speed legacy side and also on 100-gig both in Routing and in Switching? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. So it's a great question. And obviously, it's a tremendous area of focus for us. For any given platform, take an MX, a PTX, a QFX or just broader routing, switching, et cetera, you're going to see continuous price erosion for a given port speed. This is nothing new. This is something that we're very used to and has been a fact of life that we've had to deal within this industry since the very first product that we introduced into the market. Now as architecture has evolved and our customers have the ability to move to different architectures that can leverage a different platform, so if you have \u2013 it traditionally builds a scale-up architecture with an MX, and now you're going to go to a scale-out that uses a PTX as an example, there is a price differential between those two platforms that one has to factor. And we are seeing some of that right now for some of the few deployments with our largest Cloud provider to have the ability to transition their architectures in that way. Ultimately, I do believe that it pays off, because you have to assume that these large Cloud providers are going to continue to see growth in their business, are going to continue to see a lot of demand on their services. And therefore, they're going to need to buy way more ports. That's what we're counting on. That's what I believe is going to happen. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on would be, any thoughts on exiting slower or underperforming product areas, such as campus switching, for example? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Well, I mean, as far as thoughts of exiting, we are applying a lot of very ruthless analyses to all new products, businesses, technologies where we're going to be investing in, with the goal of making sure that these investments actually do pay off. Campus, I have said this now over the last year or so, even longer than that, I believe, we're going to be focusing on our campus efforts in the large enterprises where we believe that we have some level of differentiation. And also, there is a high degree of leveraging of our development with data center switching, right? We understand, we don't have a WiFi portfolio. So there's no point in us in going after opportunities where WiFi is tightly integrated with campus. So, yes, we are in campus, but we are really laser-focused on campus opportunities, where we believe that we really have some differentiation. And actually the way I describe this to our teams and our customers is for those enterprises that view their campus as on-ramps to the Cloud where they need high-performance network in order to access Cloud workloads and data sets. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks, Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just some clarification on these Cloud customers over the last couple of quarters which \u2013 Rami, was this a communication issue, or was there sort of a last-minute change and how they viewed architecture over the next big 6- to 12-month deployments internally there? I'm just trying to figure out if we go back to spring timeframe when you were executing this vertical to now, just sort of how that played out with these accounts, as much as you can describe? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Look, it's a great question. And we're obviously disappointed in the fact that we weren't able to predict this. We're very close to our Cloud customers. We engage and talk to them on a very regular basis. We're obviously a very part of their network. What has happened here is an acceleration of plans ahead of what we had expected. So as much as we try very, very hard to predict some of these inflection points, sometimes our own customers' plans can change, which makes it obviously difficult, if not impossible for us to predict these sorts of changes. That's really what it is. I don't think it was a communication problem. Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. A couple of questions for me. On the Cloud vertical, what is the rough split between Switching and Routing? And I know you guys have said Routing probably vast majority, but can you give us a split there? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So what we've said is Routing is still the majority, but it's not the vast majority within the Cloud vertical. In fact, in the first half of this year, you saw Switching get really close to Routing. Routing was still the majority, call that greater than 50%, but it wasn't the vast majority like you would see in Telco, for example. Clearly, these Q3 results, the miss being predominantly Cloud Switching, that mix has gone back to more Routing heavy. But we are expecting over time, the Switching component in Cloud to actually outpace Routing. And eventually, we think that will be the dominant technology within that vertical. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. The next question is on the \u2013 just the impact this quarter. Did this come from just the single customer, or you really saw \u2013 I know \u2013 I get the architectural changes that are happening and how it may impact more than just one customer. But specific to Q3, was this coming from just one large customer, or were there several ones involved here on the Switching side? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I mean, all we can say is there is a fairly high degree of concentration with hyper-scalers, especially as it pertains to switching in Juniper's business. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I would say, I mean, it's not one customer, but it's also not several. I mean, you asked if it's one of those two, it's neither of those. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, all right. And then lastly, my follow-up. If you guys are guiding Routing to be flat next year, given the transition you're seeing, given also the Switching that you said may get to the normal pattern, but there's still kind of a poor visibility on that I suppose at this stage. And then Security is sort of going through the ebbs and flows, it doesn't seem like you will hit your 3% to 6% CAGR target as you've outlined in the past. So shouldn't you be maybe thinking around the flat growth next year? I know you're not providing guidance, but should investor be thinking this is how 2018 is going to shake out, right, given whatever you just said? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so good question. So, let me just talk about Switching for a second. We do expect Switching to grow next year. I think that's important. We've talked about the Tier 2, Tier 3 traction we're getting, which is double-digit growth. QFX all up grew year-on-year even this quarter, with these results with this large spending delay. So we expect Switching to be a growth driver for us. As it relates to kind of FY 2018 as you mentioned, I'm not giving specific guidance. But I will say this, we are going to be very focused on growing. We think there's an opportunity to grow. That said, we're equally, if not more so, focused on earnings expansion. And that's something that we've \u2013 I believe, we've shown some steps in the last several quarters. And I think we'll continue to show steps in that regard, making sure we focused on operating excellence and taking costs out where we can, but making sure we focus the costs, the investments that we are making in the right areas to enable long-term growth. We also have a very strong cash flow. As you know, our balance sheet is strong. We have a very sustained capital return program. So I do think we are very focused on bottom line, and we'll continue to be next year. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jayson Noland from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Rami, you've mentioned SD-WAN a couple of times, I believe. It's a hot category. And Juniper's name doesn't come up that often, crowded market to be fair, I guess. Do you have what you need from a portfolio perspective here? And then how would SD-WAN impact your traditional router market, assuming some success? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. So I'm actually not surprised by your comment that our name doesn't come up all that often, and that's pretty much because we've taken a very deliberate strategy where at least initially, we're focusing our SD-WAN solution on scalable, multitenant, very versatile like extensible architectures with security built in, that are very appealing to our service provider customers. Service providers all want an SD-WAN strategy and recognize that they need some help with it, and this is essentially what we're doing. We've developed a solution ideally suited for their plans. And we're seeing traction there. As far as impact to the rest of the Routing business, I know there were all sorts of predictions that this is going to have a deflationary effect on MPLS and so forth. But I have to say that thus far based on conversations with many of our Telco customers where, of course, we enjoy very strong relationships, it hasn't had that effect. I just don't expect it to have any sort of meaningful effect on the need for IP routing or MPLS capabilities in the wide area and in the foreseeable future. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Paul, your line is live. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, are you there? Operator : Well, I think he just disconnected. We'll move on to the next question. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. We'll go on to the next. Operator : Yeah, from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Just in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, doesn't seem to envision any type of normal seasonality in the traditional service provider market, certainly no budget flush or normal increase of given seasonality. So can you just talk about that a little bit more, and why you don't expect to see fourth quarter increase in the telco market? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So I think, I mean, we're actually almost at a new normal with Telco. I mean, the last few years, we've seen kind of a challenged market there. And we haven't had big Telco flushes of recent times. We used to have those back in the growth days in the Telco space. But at this point, we expect Telco to remain challenged. I mean that's \u2013 as we all know, a particularly lumpy business. So it's hard to predict with certainty. But I don't expect flushes at this point. In our outlook, we have not assumed an increase in Telco spend in the Q4 because that's just not what we see given the environment that they're in. Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for the question. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Rami, can you hear me? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. We can hear you, Paul. Go ahead. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciate it. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Go ahead, Paul. (53:15) Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I apologize returning to the question yet again. But I just want to make sure I understand, and perhaps I'm misinterpreting some stuff you said previously. But when you say that you're disrupting yourself and that drove the issue, and then this is across a number of different, at least more than one player, more than one of the Cloud customers, I'm confused why you didn't \u2013 if you drove yourself, why wouldn't you see the issue, as opposed to the Cloud operators changing their architecture, then advising you to change and it catches you unaware. What's the reconciliation? And then for Ken... Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Paul... (53:57) Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: On the gross margin, can you remind us \u2013 I think you said in the past that your Cloud customers have the same gross margin (54:07) or corporate average, can you just remind us of that? Thanks, guys. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, to your question about why we could not have predicted this, yes, we did, in fact, develop these products and the solution with an eye that the architectures are going to evolve. What we did not predict and could not have predicted because the plans change for our customers themselves is timing and the pace at which they have moved. And honestly, I mean, it's impressive despite their size and just how nimble they can be in embracing and deploying new architectural approaches. And again, keep in mind that in the Cloud vertical and where we're seeing the bulk of the sort of the transition that's happening, it's the large Cloud vertical \u2013 the large customers is why it doesn't take all that many to make a meaningful change to our overall business. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I just want to clarify, what we're seeing is the pause in between \u2013 in this transition, right? So we're seeing the previous architectures, if you will, the spend slowed down there dramatically as they get ready for the new architecture ramps into the future. On a gross margin perspective, what we've said and continue to say is the Cloud vertical by itself doesn't have a margin difference. What does drive margin more than customer vertical is technology. So because the Cloud vertical historically has had a higher switching mix than the Telco vertical as an example has a larger \u2013 has a lower margin profile, but it's really due to product not customer at this point. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of on the competitive landscape, again, I'm just curious as we look at some of the competitors launching and pushing their Jericho II or Jericho Plus based platforms into the market, how we should think about your guys as competitive positioning as it relates to kind of product cycle cadence, particularly on the router side of the business? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Certainly. So we are keenly aware of the competitive dynamics that are happening all around us, especially in the Cloud space where \u2013 and Routing, which is I think where you really wanted to focus, in the Cloud space where we enjoyed some good footprint. We developed the PTX from a silicon and software standpoint, as what I believe again to be this perfect blend of Routing and Switching capabilities that can evolve with our customer's architectures. The roadmap for the PTX, I mean, we get encouraged now by the momentum of the product, and we make sure that we're going to be continuing to invest in ways that keep us ahead of our customer's requirements, and also the competition. And what I believe to be the case here is that the PTX will remain very competitive with the Cloud customer's, in particular, and we'll actually start to gain more traction in other verticals like large enterprise space and telcos over time. Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And as a real quick follow-up. I'm curious on the realignment efforts, do you have any targeted kind of operating expense reductions? Is this truly just a reinvestment or realignment of investments, or are you expecting to take costs out of the company? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so we have been taking head count and costs out as we continue to optimize kind of our operations. I would say that it's largely in line with our revenue expectations. We're going to manage OpEx largely in line with revenue. And as we see challenges to the revenue top side and gross margins for that matter, we are going to look to take costs out and protect the bottom line. Going forward at the same \u2013 the challenge and what we're really focused on is doing that in a way that doesn't hurt the long-term growth of the business, making sure we are investing in the right area, so that's where it goes down to operational excellence ideas. We've done a lot in the past on consolidating and collapsing management, et cetera, and really focused on areas that do save money, but also don't come at the expense of output. So that's really what we're focused on going forward. Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining us and your great questions. As always, we'll speak with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our most recent 10Q and 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our8-K filed day, and in other documents that we filed with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information could be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Revenue guidance is provided using ASC 605. We will adopt ASC 606 for Q1 2018 and intend to provide a ASC 606 to 605 reconciliation when we report first quarter results. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, is included in the press release, furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.  Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you, Jess. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported mixed results for the fourth quarter. While revenue and non-GAAP EPS were both above the midpoint of guidance, gross margins remained under pressure and we continued to experience weakness in both routing and in the cloud. This weakness is primarily being driven by the shift to a scale out from scale up architecture, most notably at several of our largest cloud customers, which appear likely to persist through at least the upcoming quarter. This shift is impacting our financial results by creating near term revenue headwind as new architectures take time to roll out and ramp. And margin pressures as we look to disrupt our own business with new lean core technologies that deliver both material efficiencies for our customers and price performance advantages versus competitive platforms. Despite this ongoing headwind in a small number of hyperscalers, we remain confident in our position within the cloud vertical, where we have built substantial footprint with many large cloud providers over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close support of our cloud customers as they\u2019ve grown. As their growth continues, we believe it is clear that their network architectures need to evolve, and we're leading the charge to more automated, cost efficient, scalable networks. What's important is that we're confident in our belief that we continue to maintain our strong footprint as these shifts unfold and seeing solid demand for PT exports, which have already surpassed MX port shipments within the cloud vertical. We continue to challenge the status quo, and while that at times result in short term disruption, similar to what we're currently seeing, we believe this approach will make us more relevant with our most important customer. With network traffic at our cloud customers seeing rapid growth, and many of these customers having already made significant progress in their architectural transition, we believe the headwinds impacting our Q1 outlook, are likely to prove transitory and expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year over year growth likely by the end of the year.  We believe our optimism is supported by our deal pipeline, the opportunity our customers see with our new product innovation, and the momentum we're seeing with new accounts across various customer verticals. While much of my commentary has focused on the cloud vertical, it's important to highlight that we continue to gain relevance with our tier one telco and cable customers, and build momentum with strategic enterprise accounts, where we added nearly 3,500 new logos in 2017. Both of these remain important verticals that give me confidence in the long term opportunity and trajectory of the business. Now I'd like to summarize the performance across routing, switching and security in Q4. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year over year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, due in large part to continued deployment delays at our largest cloud customers, new PTS footprint opportunities within the cloud, and continued MX demand in telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continue to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory of our routing portfolio. In switching, we saw double digit sequential growth in Q4, even though the business declined year over year. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyperscale customers, our QFX product line continued to grow at double digit rates year over year. That growth is happening across public and private cloud segments, driven in part by 100 gig adoption. In addition, our innovative pipeline remains strong as evidenced by advancements in automation and telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operations. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including cloud and hyperscalers. In Security, our business saw both sequential and year over year growth, driven by momentum in financial services, government and telco sales. More customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q4 that are leveraging its benefits. Our improvement in Security was broad based across products and geographies, and we continue to see an uptick in million dollar plus deals, which is providing confidence our security business is likely to see a return to growth in 2018. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including tier one carriers in both Europe and Asia, as well as recurring revenues from the renewal of existing annual subscription. We are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail that we expect will result in an expansion of its use cases across a broader set of customers. We are also seeing success with our SD-WAN solution, which has already secured three tier one service provider wins, while the AppFormix customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprise and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases. In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts, resulting in another quarter of year over year growth. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We\u2019re innovating in ways that truly mattered to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us.  In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half 2017 results, or our outlook for Q1 2018, we're confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market, and drive a return to growth by the end of 2018. Based on this confidence, we have announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization with the intention of initiating a $750 million ASR and an increase in our quarterly dividend by 80% to $0.18 a share. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I specially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our fourth quarter performance and results. Our fourth quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS results were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Total fourth quarter revenue was $.239 billion, down 11% year over year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53. We continue to see architectural shifts in the cloud vertical impact our routing and switching businesses, which both declined year over year. However, Security was up both sequentially and year over year. Our Services business continued to be solid, posting year over year and sequential growth, driven by strong renewal and attach rates. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States.  Product deferred revenue was $334 million, up $11 million or 3% both year over year and sequentially. Product gross margins were below our expectations, primarily due to product mix as we had less routing revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 6% year over year and 1% sequentially, reflecting a lower variable compensation, as well as our continued focus on managing expenses. As a percentage of revenue, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were 38.6%. In the quarter, we had good cash flow from operations of $214 million. We repurchased $330 million worth of shares and paid $37 million in dividends. Moving on to the results for the full year. Fiscal 2017 saw modest revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth of 1%. Routing declined 7% due to ongoing architectural transitions in the cloud vertical. Our switching business had a record year, up 12% driven by QFX, which grew 25%. While Security declined 8% for the year, we did see sequential growth for the last three quarters and a return to year over year growth in the fourth quarter. Our Services business remained strong, growing 8% for the full year. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the Americas declined 1% and AMEA declined 3% for the year. However, Asia-Pac grew 13% in 2017. For the full year, Strategic Enterprise posted growth of 4%, cloud declined 1% and telecom and cable was flat. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, four were cloud, five were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% declined 120 basis points year over year, primarily due to lower volume, product mix and higher memory costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and service margins. In 2017, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense decline of $17 million or 1%. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 39.1%. For the year, we had strong cash flows from operations of $1.260 billion, up $153 million from the previous year. We repurchased $720 million worth of shares, and paid $150 million in dividends.  Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q1 revenue outlook reflects ongoing deployment delays as we expect our large cloud customers to continue the architectural transition. This is expected to result in below normal seasonality for the first quarter. As Rami discussed, this architectural transition is related to the evolution of these customers\u2019 networks to be more automated, cost efficient and scalable. Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers. While the timing of the architectural transitions we are experiencing is dynamic and somewhat uncertain, we expect revenue to grow on a sequential basis beyond the first quarter and a return to year on year growth by the end of the year. We expect gross margins for the quarter to remain under pressure due to lower volume and product mix, resulting from our customers architectural shifts. There are many factors that impact gross margins, and while it is a dynamic environment, we expect full year margins to improve directionally from Q1 levels. We are undertaking specific efforts to address the pressure on our gross margins. These efforts included value engineering, optimizing our supply chain, pricing management and increasing software and solutions sales. Despite the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase of fringe costs, we expect to manage our operating expenses prudently and to increase operational efficiencies, both in the first quarter and throughout the year. For 2018, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be approximately 21%. The reduction in the projected tax rate is primarily driven by the change in US corporate income tax rate under the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, partially offset by the net increase in the current tax of certain foreign earnings mandated by the act. Following the adoption of the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we plan to repatriate approximately $3 billion. We expect the new territory tax system to provide us lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis. We intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value enhancing M&A and fund our return of capital to shareholders. I'm pleased to report our board of directors have approved a new $2 billion buyback authorization, including our intent to enter into a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. In addition, they declared an increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. This reflects an increase of 80% compared to previous quarterly dividends. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani :  Hi guys. Last quarter you had an issue also with some cloud customers. 0What I'm trying to understand this quarter is, when it comes to your guidance, can you distinguish between what could be perceived as share loss, maybe architectural decisions of customers that are not - at least not for now doesn't fit your portfolio and between just spending issues, because in your commentary you spoke mostly about spending rather than your own kind of situation within customers. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Hey Tal, it\u2019s Rami. Let me start. So the message that we delivered in the last quarter's earnings call, which was very much around confidence that we're both in the starting and ending phase of this - our architectural transition that we're going to - that we're seeing with our cloud customers, remains absolutely consistent here and now. So we fundamentally believe, based on the customer conversations that we're having, the work that we're doing on certifying certain products, the software that we're developing that has certain capabilities and features that are very much desired by our cloud customers, including the largest hyperscale customers, all lead us to have confidence that we will benefit from the recovery.  So while it doesn't feel great to be right now in this situation where we're in the middle of this transition, I do firmly believe that we will benefit from the resumption in spending by cloud providers in a new architectural approach that is very different than the starting approach, one that is characterized with scale outs, one that leverages a new product, which is the PTX. Very fortunate and happy that we have technology like the PTX that can capture this transition and ensure that we maintain and even expand our footprint. So the net of it, Tal, is that I remain very confident that we will benefit from the resumption in spending and that this is not about a loss of share or footprint to the competition. Tal Liani : If I can ask one more question, just shifting gear to the MX. You speak about the PTX. In the past, the MX was very strong. Are you talking less about the MX now because of risk of competition with Arista? Or is it more about carrier spending, characteristics of carrier spending? Rami Rahim : Yes. The MX is probably one of, if not the most successful routing platforms that\u2019s ever seen in the market across cloud, enterprise, telecom operators. It\u2019s just in a different phase of its life cycle than the PTX. The PTX is a newer product. I think many of our customers across verticals, but especially in the cloud vertical, see the benefits of having what we have described as a super core or a lean core architecture that enables them to deal with the incredible growth of traffic in their networks at a very cost optimized form factor and price point. And for that reason, we have seen a transition and will continue to see a transition with cloud providers from MX ports to PTX ports. That does have deflationary pressure on a pricing standpoint on per port basis. But the good news is, if you look at the cloud provider businesses that they have, if you look at the growth in the traffic that they are seeing, eventually I believe this pays off for us because we maintain the footprint and can capture that growth, albeit with a different product, which is the PTX. The MX in other verticals, so take telcos and enterprises for that matter, I think that transition to a PTX Is it's not going to happen anytime soon. It\u2019s going to be limited to a relatively small number of use cases, because typically where the MX is used in a telco scenario or an enterprise scenario, you're leveraging far more than IP packet transport. You\u2019re looking using its service delivery capabilities that just don't lend themselves to a migration to lean core architecture as easily. So most of that transition is going to happen in the cloud space, and a lot of that transition, as I mentioned in my starting commentary, is behind us already. Tal Liani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. Just one quick clarification before I ask my question. You\u2019ve guided the share count for March to 360 million shares. What assumption are you making in that number for the buyback? Is that the full $750 million accelerated that you're assuming? I just want to make sure I understand that. Ken Miller : Yes. This is Ken. So there are really two factors. One is we did just come off of a Q4 where we did $330 million of share repurchases. So we were opportunistic in Q4. So we\u2019re actually ending the year with less shares than we anticipated just 90 days ago. And second - the second factor is the one you mentioned is the ASR. So we're factoring in the impact to the ASR. You don't get full retirement immediately, but you get the majority of that impact in Q1. Simon Leopold : So we should think about that even without assuming anything beyond that, the share count should be lower also in the June quarter than when you get the full impact, correct? Ken Miller : Yes. Majority will happen in Q1. There\u2019ll be a follow up impact in Q2 and it will stay throughout the rest of the year at those lower levels. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks. So the question I want to ask is I know a difficult one to answer, but it's pretty key for I think folks to be able understand this transition product cycle around PTX adoption versus MX. And so you have I guess some substitution in your cloud vertical. We\u2019re often asked, what's the price difference between a PTX and an MX? And so we know the purport pricing is lower. You just mentioned that, Rami. Can you help explain this and how people should think about modeling when you've got this kind of product transition where there is ASP pressure, but probably some change in the number of ports that would be shipping in this transition. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. I appreciate the question, Simon and it is a difficult one to answer. So I\u2019m - honestly I'm not going to answer it. I will say the following, which is that there is a meaningful price difference between the PTX and the MX. And you have to think of this from the standpoint of, we've been talking about the fact that routing and switching are essentially kind of blending over time. And the PTX is a perfect example of that manifesting itself in a new product. So there is a meaningful price difference, but where it's used, typically it's used in areas where there is tremendous scale, and massive increase in traffic. And that's what we're seeing in the cloud provider space. So I can tell you that although overall revenue in the cloud providers is going to be under pressure as we go through the transition, we are going to be selling substantially more ports, albeit PTX ports, in some cases QFX ports, than we did with the MX product historically. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kvaal : Yes, thank you very much and Jess, welcome to the battle. I guess two questions if I may. One, Ken for you. I think, could we delve into the gross margin issue a little bit? To sharpen the question a little bit. In the - in early 2016, you were delivering not that different revenue, $1.1 billion or so and yet the gross margins were going to be 600 basis points higher then than they look likely to be this year, two years later. So that's a big shift and I\u2019m wondering if you could help us unpack that. And then for Rami, you mentioned M&A and obviously that was a little bit of a topic, both on what you may be interested in purchasing. And also of course there is a whole slew of Nokia discussions in December. So any comments that you have related to M&A would be helpful. Thank you. Ken Miller : Sure. So I\u2019ll take the gross margin question first. So there are many factors that impact gross margin as you know. And as it relates to the guidance of 58% plus or minus one, the Q1 guidance, really I think the easiest way to explain it would be to kind of bridge it from the Q4 levels. So think to 63.5%, 62% kind of level. Really there are three primary drivers in the decline, all of which are putting pressure on the margin itself. The first one is lower volume. So the revenue guide is a couple of hundred million less than the Q4 level. So that does have an impact on gross margin when you do that bridge. It\u2019s just a factor of fixed cost as a percentage of total revenue.  The second factor is really the continuing product technology mix. So we've been talking about technology mix for a while. Think routing to switching. As routing is actually taking a bigger burden of the revenue decline, as a percentage of our total revenue, routing is down and that's also having a headwind to margin. And last but not least would be actually product mix within routing. So we talked a lot about the architectural shifts and a lot of that is MX to PTX from a scale up to scale out architecture. While the PTX margins are very healthy and actually above the corporate average, they are below our MX margin. So I do think that's another contributing factor into our margin guide. As Rami mentioned, it\u2019s important to note that some of that is behind us. 50% of our PTX exports are actually substantially more than 50% of our PTX ports that we shipped in \u201817 to the cloud vertical, or PTX ports I should say. So that's a good story. We do expect margin to directionally be up. We think the full year levels will be up off of these Q1 - of this Q1 guide. Rami Rahim : Jeff, let me answer your first question or your second question around M&A. first, let me say that the fact that we've put in place what we view as a good capital allocation policy and strategy now, it should be a sign that we have confidence that some of the challenges that we're going through right now in terms of this architectural transition, are in fact transitory. Having said that, I think we have a healthy balance sheet, especially now with repatriation of foreign cash. And I have been consistent in saying that we will continue to look for value enhancing M&A, and it would be very much in areas that would accelerate our existing strategy.  I don't believe that we need a new strategy. We\u2019ve developed a strategy that very much respects the major trend that's happening in our industry, which is around the cloud. This is not just about serving the cloud providers, but helping our telco customers and the enterprise customers in moving to a multi cloud environment, with easy management automation and security. So these are sort of the areas that we would look for to accelerate the - our execution with value enhancing M&A that we're already working on today. Thank you. Jess Lubert : Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. I wanted to dig in again into the gross margin. Maybe you can give us some color on the impact of volume on margins. How much of the fact that you missed the - that you're missing the cloud volume is impacting pricing of other products? Meaning, are you now at a point where volumes that you are purchasing from suppliers are below levels such that pricing of the components that you buy is rising? Ken Miller : Yes. So I mean volume as it relates to our fixed cost versus variable cost, is a big factor. I listed as the first primary factor, but it's really not impacting our purchasing power and our contract manufacturers. We have longer term contracts with our contract manufacturer providers and it doesn't have a quarter to quarter impact based on volume. So when I mention volume here, I'm really alluding to our actual standard margin is higher than our average gross margin because of some of the fixed cost components that get included into the gross margin math. Ittai Kidron : Okay. And then second, just follow up on the tax rate, the 21%. I would have hoped it would be lower. I guess I'm trying to understand why not just by blending your - the mix of your operating profits international versus US, you won\u2019t get to a lower rate. Can it go lower from here or this is the level set following the tax rule? Ken Miller : Yes. So this is a level we're going to - we expect given the new tax rule. The big difference with just simply the blended approach that you mentioned, is we\u2019re actually going to have a US tax on international earnings of roughly 10% in the new tax reform rules. So I think that's probably the piece you\u2019re missing. So that results in the 21% expectation for this year. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you guys. Two questions if I could. Can we talk a little bit about the switching here and the transitions going on there? Maybe just give us a little color on the move to 100G and maybe a little update on how you\u2019re doing on core as opposed to the edge market. And then separately, on the telco vertical, just the traditional telcos, it sounds like that was pretty decent in the quarter. Rami, could you just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from that vertical as operators start to set their budgets for 2018? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Certainly, Tim. So I\u2019ll start with switching. So our switching business first has two components to it. There\u2019s the campus business and the data center business, the first being the EX product line, the second the QFX. We\u2019ve said now that QFX have exceeded the EX. So data center dominates the use case that we are pursuing and where the business momentum is. We\u2019re very pleased with our all up switching business growth last year, and in particular the QFX which grew 25% year over year.  And if you break apart the QFX business, it has a broad based component that feeds its way into large enterprises, telcos, data centers and smaller type cloud providers. That has consistently had solid momentum throughout last year, and I expect it to have that momentum through 2018 as well, growing at essentially double digit year over year growth on a consistent, quarterly basis. Then there is a much more concentrated hyperscaler component to our QFX business, and that's going to very much follow these transitions from 40 to 100 gig that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters. So there is going to be some cyclicality to the QFX data center business as we work through these transitions. And I do think that there is an opportunity for us to break into more hyperscale switching opportunities throughout the year. I mean that is a big area of focus for us.  On the telco side, it's really more of the same in terms of market dynamics. I think our telco customers continue to run their networks harder and are getting more comfortable with that. They themselves are moving towards cloud oriented service delivery models, and we leverage that with products like Contrail, our switching portfolio and our virtual network functions. There is - there are some headwinds due to M&A consolidation that's happening in the telco space. So we're not expecting any breakthrough growth from telco anytime in the near future at this point. Looking out a little bit further as you get into 5G, as you get into the build up necessary to support 5G traffic, especially in the metro, I do view that as an opportunity. But we have to sort of temper our expectations because I do think that this market is going to be somewhat challenging, at least for the foreseeable future. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. A couple of questions if I might. First off, if you said earlier, my apologies, but Rami, can any share losses whatsoever beyond your potential transition that you all cited? Rami Rahim : Sorry. Are there any share losses whatsoever? Let me say this. I know this is sort of top of mind for all of you guys, but I was - I am very confident that where we have the major footprint across our large customers, especially in the cloud space, I feel like we have the right customers around the technology and understanding what's required to maintain that footprint, and to continue to grow in that footprint. And not only that, to actually expand into new opportunities. So it's not just a game of defense where we\u2019re trying to hold on to what we have and leverage the growth in those areas, but we are very much playing offence and trying to steal footprint away from the competition. That\u2019s the way I view the competitive landscape today. Since joining Juniper now over 20 years ago, I can tell you that the one constant element to that period of time has been it's a very competitive landscape across all of our vertical market segments. And we're comfortable operating in a very competitive landscape. Paul Silverstein : Rami, appreciate that. Just to be clear, relative to the architectural transition that you're citing in terms of the near term weakness, you don't believe that you all had any meaningful share losses at those several hyperscale customers, the several cloud customers. Rami Rahim : Yes. I agree with what you just said. We do not believe so. Paul Silverstein : All right. Two quick questions if I might. You cited an increase, I believe you said on a normalized basis, excluding the cloud architectural transition for PTX. I\u2019m just a little bit confused. I would think - it sounds like PTX, or at least I thought that PTX wasn't impacted, is actually going to benefit from the architectural transition, but on the comm as those folks displace MX with PTX. So why was PTX an issue in terms of you're citing it on a normalized basis, with the implication being that it's declined year over year not normalized in terms of full impact. And then Ken, a question for you in OpEx. I think I heard you say you\u2019ll manage OpEx prudently or efficiently throughout the year. Can you translate that for us in terms of your expectations for the year? Do we expect OpEx to be flat, to be down, to be up modestly? Any insight you can provide will be appreciated. Appreciate it guys. Rami Rahim : Paul, let me start with the PTX question and then Ken, you can jump in on the OpEx question. So I'm not concerned at all about the performance of the PTX in 2017 and going into 2018. There will be lumpiness to the PTX that are very much tied to large scale deployments in the cloud provider space especially. But all up, I mean Q3 was a record quarter for the PTX. Looking at the opportunities that we're working on with the large hyperscalers, as well as some telcos, there is an opportunity to see meaningful growth in the PTX this year relative to last year. So I'm much less concerned about what this is going to do on a quarter over quarter basis, and much more looking at the opportunities of where - that we've won already and the build outs that are already in progress. Ken? Ken Miller : Yes. From an OpEx perspective, first of all, I want to note, we are pleased with our Q4 results. I mean, we did come in below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to our headcount related costs, as well as some lower variable compensation. As we look ahead, we're not going to provide full year guidance. We did provide Q1 guidance of 45, plus or minus five, which is even with the fringe reset, as well as the variable comp reset. I think that shows you that we are very focused on OpEx discipline and will remain disciplined. We are - over the long term, we\u2019re looking to expand operating margins. In a down revenue environment, I would say that we will also manage OpEx down. We\u2019re not going to be able to perhaps match it one for one, but we are going to be very focused on OpEx as we move throughout the year and we see the revenue start to hit the quarters. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovic from UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovic : Thanks. Rami, did the timing of this architectural shift change in the last quarter? I think last quarter you were talking about the switching side coming back relatively quickly, and you did see sequential growth. But I don't know if it's coming back as quickly as you expected, and similarly if the routing is now extending out weaker, deeper into the year than you previously thought. Rami Rahim : Yes, it's a good question, Steve. I don't think that it's playing out exactly as we had expected. I think that when you're trying to do forecasting in - on a set of products that have a very high degree of customer concentration, you only need to sort of get it wrong for a couple of customers to get the overall forecast wrong or the timing wrong. So generally speaking, based on our Q1 outlook, it's fair to say that the transition has taken a little bit longer than what we initially expected. Having said that, we're no longer sort of at the beginning of the transition, looking out and trying to predict it in that way. We\u2019re sort of in the middle of it, and you can see that just from the port mix that we're now selling into the large cloud providers today, where the PTX has already exceeded pretty substantially the MX ports that we're selling into that market segment. Ken Miller : Yes, I would just add, I mean I do think we expect switching to be a growth driver for us. We expect switching to return to growth in the second half and actually be full year growth for FY\u201918. We\u2019re also very pleased with the momentum we\u2019re seeing in security. We had our first year on year growth quarter in a while and we expect that FY\u201918 to be a year of security growth for us on a full year basis. But routing, given the transition and the difficulty in coming - understanding, when does it come back and when it\u2019s going to come back in enough volume to offset some of the headwinds, I think it's reasonable to expect routing to be down on a full year basis in FY\u201918. Steve Milunovic : The growth in Asia Pacific, was that new insertions and do you expect growth to continue? Rami Rahim : I'm super proud of our APAC team for the momentum that they've demonstrated over the last couple of years in what is a very competitive landscape. And I do think that there are opportunities to continue the momentum into 2018, yes. We\u2019ve been talking now for the last year about strategic insertions and particular in China. And our expectation is that those will start to pay off at some point this year. Steve Milunovic : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead. Patrick Newton : Good afternoon, Rami and Ken. I guess I'm trying to piece together your goal of returning year over year growth exiting the year and weighed against security growing year over year, switching growing year over year and then routing not growing. So is it right to think that return of end of year growth is really the 4Q timeframe and also the 3Q year over year growth are very small? And once this transitory architecture headwind is complete, it sounds like even with your routing outlook, that we should expect only tepid year over year growth in 4Q. Just want to make sure I'm kind of piecing together all the parts correctly. Rami Rahim : Yes. No, I would look at it as when we talk about sequential growth and then returning to year on year growth by the end of the year, I would think Q4 is right timeframe and that's all up. That\u2019s an all up comment, not necessarily particular to any technology. We do think the routing transition, although we're - I would phrase, we're in the middle of it, there's still a fair amount of disruption that's going to cause the FY\u201918 number from a routing perspective as we continue to finish up the transition and hopefully set us up for growth beyond this year. But I think this year routing, we expect to be down given this current visibility we have and our expectations of the timing of the transition. Patrick Newton : All right. and then taking that answer and starting out with your 40, or 58% gross margin and margin marching up sequentially through the year, is it fair to assume that given the impact of greater PTX and switch mix, that gross margin in 4Q\u201918 would still likely be below your 4Q \u201817 levels? Rami Rahim :  Yes. Again, not going to get that specific out for quarters. I'm really focused on making sure we get our more visible quarters predicted correctly. I will say this. I do think that we expect revenue to grow. Therefore, I think it's a reasonable assumption that we\u2019re making that the margin should also grow directionally. I want to make sure that there is going to be deal mix and customer mix. It\u2019s difficult to predict when you get out to any particular quarter, but we do believe margin should recover from the Q1 levels by the time we exit the year. Patrick Newton : Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Rami, Ken. My question is really around competition in routing as we head into 100 gig and perhaps 400 gig routing from suppliers such as Arista in particular. How do you compete in a situation where your competition would use high density 100 gig, 400 gig platforms with the competition being feature performance, perhaps pricing? So help us understand the competitive strategy in routing as new entrants come into that marketplace? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question. Again, I'll just reiterate that routing has always been an incredibly competitive market. And we recognized several years ago that in order to continue to compete effectively in the routing space, we're going to need to have a new breed of routing platform. And that's when we conceived of this idea of a lean core architecture, which is defined by this product that we call the PTX. It's a good thing we did that because I think our situation today would be very different if we did not have that product and the ability to transition what is the most demanding customer, our cloud customers toward these new lean core architectures. That said, so I think that the concept was right. The execution was right on.  Now, all we need to do is to ensure that we maintain the competitive differentiation on an ongoing basis. And we will do that with the roadmap that we have in terms of software technologies that give our customers the ability to obtain telemetry and information from these systems, which is extremely important to the cloud in particular, to enable logical scale that is best in class across the industry today. And our goal is to ensure that that is - it stays that way in the future and increasingly with optics. I think that the investments that we're making in the optical space is essentially a way for us to compete on the economics of networking beyond just the IP based routing, but the integrated optical technology that I think is becoming more and more important to our customers. So all this is to say that I'm very confident that we have the right investments in place and the innovation to deal with a very competitive environment in routing. Operator : Our next question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Two real quick ones if I can. Just going back to the guidance and the ability to kind of grow - return to growth exiting the calendar year, aside from kind of port shipment transitions or inflections within your large cloud customers, I'm curious, are you assuming in that scenario that some of your cloud customers reach the inflection from a revenue standpoint in terms of the MX to PTX router transition? And then I have a quick follow up. Ken Miller : Yes. So I just want to clarify. The sequential growth that we are expecting and the return to year on year growth is not a particular customer set or a particular technology. It\u2019s really more of a Juniper overall revenue. We do have a broadening base in our switching business that Rami mentioned where we're seeing a lot of very consistent growth, double digit growth. In fact, if you normalize for the hyperscalers within the QFX, we believe security can continue to grow consistently going forward. We\u2019re still in a bit of a turnaround there, but we're seeing signs of growth there and expect growth throughout FY\u201918. So the comment I'm making is not particular to this transition. It\u2019s more broader - it's broader than that. Aaron Rakers : Okay, fair enough. And then just on the gross margin line again, looking at the guidance of 58% plus or minus in the quarter, it looks like you're guiding more or less product gross margin to be in that mid 50% range. First of all, am I correct in that assumption? And second to that, do you believe that as you kind of transition that gross margin on a product side, can they get back to a 60% plus level? Thank you. Ken Miller : Yes. So we don't all break it out for you, but I will say that it's - the service business does carry a fair amount of people costs and the reset of variable cost and fringe will have an impact on our service margin as well. Again, not going to give you the specifics, but I do think there's going to be a bit of a decline in both for Q1 off of Q4 levels. Back to the longer term margin, there's a lot of factors. I think we talked a little bit about what we're doing internally. There\u2019s a big focus internally on innovation and making sure we do the value engineering work. We need to be cost competitive.  Optimizing the supply chain is something we continue to focus on. Pricing discipline is - I know the field is growing at a new pricing discipline and I think it\u2019s going to pay off for us in the long run, as well as just increasing our software and solutions sales. There\u2019s a lot of efforts underway to return the margin to growth. I also think probably the biggest single factor is going to be getting through this transition. Although the margin impact is largely being felt as now and this quarter and perhaps over the short term here, as we get through this transition, I think that will give us the opportunity to grow margin beyond these current levels. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim, you're on. Perhaps you\u2019ll be on mute by accident. And we\u2019ll move on to the next question from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys can't provide the exact number, but just to get our handle around kind of full year revenue. So for the entire company, routing is going to be down just given the material miss for the first quarter. Is it fair to assume the entire company revenue should be down on a year over year basis for \u201918? Ken Miller : Yes. I think our expectation is to grow sequentially and return to growth late in the year. I believe it's reasonable to model that it could be a down year in full year revenue basis, based on what we see now, predominantly because of the routing shortfall. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz : Thanks. Good afternoon. A question and then a clarification. On the clarification, when you talk about the return to year over year revenue growth ending \u201918, is that predicated more on new logo penetration versus a recovery in your existing logos? And then Rami for you, on the cloud re-architecting here, that transition, when the transition is over, is there any risk that you could actually see less content sold into each environment or provider because of their efficiencies that they're trying to achieve? Ken Miller : Okay. So let me answer the second one first, on the cloud transition. This kind of pricing inflection point that is happening from the MX to the PTX, is not one that I expect to happen again anytime in sort of the foreseeable future in a cloud or anywhere else. I do think that what we're seeing now is somewhat unique just by virtue of the fact that there is truly this architectural shift that's enabled by a new breed of routing platform that blends the line with switching, and that just doesn't happen all that often. So I think once we get through it, assuming that the cloud providers, especially the large hyperscalers, will need to continue to deal with growth in their businesses, which I would bet is the case for years to come, then we will benefit for that exiting 2018. Rami Rahim : Yes. From a customer perspective, I mean the answer is both. I mean we focus on growing our current customers, both as they grow, as well as getting new footprint into existing customers. And clearly we have a big focus on new logos as well, expanding our customer base, particularly in the enterprise, in some of those verticals where we have opportunity to expand further. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. Hopefully this is better. I believe back in 2017 in the early part of the year, the cloud was a big beneficiary to you if my memory is correct. And then the second half unfolded and became a bigger headwind, preannouncements lowering, and now you're talking about visibility as people transition through this architecture. So I want to kind of take a look back and see, did you see this second half headwind coming? And if so, not so great. If not, just let us know. But also, what type of confidence do you have that this transition will come to pass where you're going to come out of this okay? Because it seems like the second half of the year was much worse than expected. Ken Miller : Yes. Hi Jim. It\u2019s a good question. I think that it's true. We have been benefiting from Cloud growth now for several years, right not just in the first part of 2017, but even for a few years behind that. As a result of that strength, we saw our market share in core routing, and particular North America, start to grow meaningfully over that time period. What we're doing now, I know it sort of feels painful and it's not the most fun thing to do from a quarterly results standpoint, but it is absolutely the right thing to do. We\u2019re essentially making sure that we disrupt ourselves and maintain the footprint that we have built to date so that we can benefit from the next wave of spending by the cloud providers. I mean that's what it really comes down to.  As far as our ability to see it, we certainly saw it at a macro level because we build products for it, right? But did we predict the timing and the magnitude of the disruption in the transition? I\u2019d say no, I don't think we predicted either of those things as well as I would have liked. But I think the most important thing is, I have the confidence that we will benefit from maintaining the footprint that we have as we get back into growth. And there is absolutely this goal that I mentioned earlier to expand into new opportunities and new footprints among the cloud providers, in particular in the data center. Rami Rahim : Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions. Operator : And our next question is James Kisner from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. James Kisner : Thank you. So just digging into one of your customer segments, strategic enterprise, I mean obviously that's pretty strong result here and acceleration. Were there any large deals that helped there? I\u2019m just kind of wondering if that - we should expect that elevated growth rate in that segment to continue? Thanks> Rami Rahim : Yes. So I'm actually very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the enterprise space. In Q4, we saw in double digit year over year growth and sequential growth. There\u2019s been a concerted effort to really go after new logos. We added 3,500 new enterprise logo in the 2017 timeframe, and I believe that will continue. It\u2019s not - there is a little bit of customer concentration, but for the most part, it's broad based. And we're definitely innovating in a way that makes us more relevant to the enterprise, with the goal of diversifying our business more in the enterprise space.  And just to give you an example of that. Contrail, which has been the SDN controller that we've developed initially primarily for large cloud and telco customers, is now essentially being repackaged in a way that solves some very meaningful enterprise problems, in particular multi cloud management and multi cloud security. The feedback that we've gotten thus far on this product direction has been phenomenal and we see some real opportunities to maintain, if not increase the momentum in the enterprise space with these technologies. Operator : And our final question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions. First, Ken, I recognize the difficulty in trying to forecast margins a year out, but can you help us think about like what the puts and takes would be that would allow you, not only to return to revenue growth year over year by the fourth quarter, but potentially even be flat or maybe up a little bit from an earnings perspective? And then maybe more broadly for you both Rami and Ken is that, you talk about that you want to be seen as, and you feel like you want to be aggressive in new opportunities, but right now you're continuing to manage OpEx and it\u2019s continuing to decline as your revenues are pressured. But all of your competitors around you are increasing their R&D to attack a lot of the same opportunities you're eyeing. So at what point, either from a time perspective or a revenue recovery perspective, should we expect you to start to match some of your competitors in terms of increasing your investment in R&D, et cetera? Thanks a lot. Rami Rahim : Hey James. Let me start with the question around investments, and then Ken, I\u2019ll let you address the first question. I'm an R&D guy. So I spent many years here developing the technologies, many of which are in the market today. So I have a good feel for this and I think that we have the right investments in the right areas. The key is focus. The key is ensuring that we remain incredibly focused, in particular on the cloud opportunity. And we're developing the technologies that make us even more relevant toward that opportunity across all of our key market segments. R&D investment as a percentage of revenue for us is actually quite healthy, if you compare us to our peers. So the net of it is I'm not concerned about our ability to invest in the areas in a very focused manner to maintain our competitive differentiation across all of our technologies/ Ken Miller : Yes. And from an earnings perspective, clearly our goal is to grow earnings over the long term. Given the kind of color that we provided on both revenue and gross margin, as well as OpEx for the year, I think it is reasonable to presume that EPS will be down on a full year basis, unless we see a stronger recovery of the revenue than we currently are projecting our models. From a - does it get to positive in Q4? I think that's clearly - it's too early to call at this point. Clearly our goal is to get to earnings growth sooner rather than later. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Rami Rahim : Thank you, everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again. Have a nice day.",

LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our most recent 10-K, the press release, and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q1 2018 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We performed well compared to our expectations during the March quarter. Total revenue of $1,083 million slightly exceeded the high end of our guidance as better than expected results in our cloud vertical along with continued success in our enterprise business more than offset weaker than expected service provider sales. Non-GAAP earnings per share also came in at the high end of our guidance at $0.28 due to the higher revenue and margin in line with our forecast. While our results were better than our guidance, we are far from satisfied and are working hard to not only return the business to growth, but drive profitability back toward normalized levels. We continue to believe we have the right products and strategy to win across our core vertical and we are continuing to innovate with the goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share. While we believe our greatest near-term opportunity remains in the cloud, we were also playing to win in our enterprise and service provider market. Based on our current product pipeline and recent customer conversation, I remain confident that Juniper controls its own destiny and its position to drive a return to growth and improve profitability by the end of the year. Now for a few highlights of the quarter. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in our cloud vertical where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms. While this process is creating ASP pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress with this transition, which should become less of a headwind through the course of the year. As proof of our progress, I'd like to highlight that several of our cloud projects that were previously on hold have started to move forward and we expect these deployments to ramp through the remainder of this year and next. Our cloud routing business experienced sequential growth during the March quarter, a trend we anticipate will continue through the rest of the year. Our PTX products accounted for more than 80% of the cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10 gig equivalent basis during Q1 compared to less than 40% one year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs began to stabilize sequentially a trend we think is likely to continue as mix headwinds subside through the year. It's also worth mentioning that our cloud switching business exceeded our own expectations in the period. Based on our results and customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer sets' rising network requirement. We will continue to innovate, challenge the status quo and deliver new levels of performance, programmability and telemetry to further strengthen our relevance to these important customers. The enterprise vertical was also a bright spot in the period with revenues growing 4% year-over-year due to strengthened financial services and healthy trends across all technologies. We believe we have a compelling portfolio of enterprise switching, security and orchestration solutions. We continue to strengthen our enterprise offering and view Contrail Enterprise Multicloud as a validation of these efforts, which should bring engineering simplicity to enterprise datacenter environments and establish Juniper as the leader in the field of intent based networking systems. Service provider revenue was soft in the quarter, declining 16% year-over-year due to seasonality and customer lumpiness. We expect service provider spending to remain sluggish in 2018, but expect to see improved spending levels beyond the March quarter. Despite a slow start to the year, we believe we continue to gain mindshare with our largest service provider customers who are recognizing the value of our nodes slicing feature, software disaggregation, and integrated optical capabilities to meet their core and edge networking requirements. We believe our efforts should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with metro initiative and 5G build out which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. Now I would like to summarize our performance across routing, switching and security. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year-over-year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, new PTX footprint opportunities within the cloud and MX requirements in the telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continues to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory for routing portfolio. In switching, our business declined 1% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonality across our key verticals. While our enterprise switching business grew year-over-year, this was offset by lower levels of spending at a few cloud customers, which we had expected. Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain highly competitive and well positioned to compete across industry verticals, including cloud and hyperscale accounts. In security, our business declined 17% quarter-over-quarter but grew 11% year-over-year, representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction and we've added many new customers in Q1 that are leveraging its benefits. Based on our current pipeline, we remain optimistic that our security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year 2018. We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which has more than doubled over the last three years. We are seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including a U.S. SaaS provider, and a global strategic enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, as highlighted by the recent release of our enhanced enterprise multicloud capabilities, which bring end to end policy and control capabilities for any workload running in physical and virtual environments any cloud and across multi-vendor environments. These are capabilities that are truly unique in the industry. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction across a widening set of customers with new wins in the service provider and enterprise verticals. We plan to introduce new software innovations to the portfolio through the course of the year that drive customer efficiencies, enhance the value of our existing hardware platforms and result in more recurring software revenue which should prove accretive to growth and margins. While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services business to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced growth year-over-year. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architecture to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. In summary, while we continued to believe 2018 is likely to be a transition year for Juniper, we are confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market and drive the return to growth by the end of the year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations and were above the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP EPS. The change to the new accounting standard ASC 606 did not materially impact the overall first quarter financial results, and therefore the discussion of our first quarter results will reflect the adoption of ASC 606. Total first quarter revenue was $1,083 million, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28. As we expected, the architectural shifts in the cloud vertical continued, however, cloud revenues were up slightly sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The service provider vertical was challenged due to the timing of customer deployments, resulting in decreases both year-over-year and sequentially. Enterprise increased 4% year-over-year, due to strengths in all technologies. Routing and switching both declined year-over-year. However, we continue to see positive momentum in security where we saw a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud, four were service providers and two were enterprises. Of these customers, four were located outside of the United States. Product and service deferred revenue declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have been up approximately 19% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Service deferred revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2%. The result on a year-over-year and sequential basis was largely due to lower revenue, customer and product mix and higher service costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. On a year-over-year basis, memory component costs were also a factor. Non GAAP operating expense was $497 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, but an increase of 4% sequentially. The sequential increase reflects the annual reset of variable compensation as well as targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, designed to strengthen products and market opportunities that we believe will drive differentiation and create future shareholder value. Our strong cash flow generation continued, with cash flow from operations of $271 million for the quarter. As we mentioned during our January call, during the first quarter, we initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase program and paid $62 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the March quarter was $3.4 billion and we repatriated $2.5 billion during the quarter. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects a return to normal seasonality. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve sequentially due to increased volume and improvements in our cost structure. While we believe better volumes and cost structure efficiency should drive further non-GAAP gross margin improvement during the second half of the year, the pace of this improvement could be offset by mix and other factors. Based on our expected spending levels through the first half of the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat for the full year 2018. In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Before I ask my question, just a quick clarification. I did hear a comment that you expected security to grow for the year. I don't know if you made a similar comment on switching, so just wanted to clarify that. And let me ask the broader question is, we understand the transition to PTX replacing MX in the cloud vertical. I get a lot of questions about the same transition happening in service providers. And I know some operators like Verizon deployed PTX many years ago. But could you help us understand why we should or should not expect a similar product transition in your service provider vertical? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Simon, thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one around our expectation for security and switching for the year. The indications that we're getting in terms of customer conversations, the strength of the technology, we just had a great RSA conference showing a few weeks ago. The pipeline is looking good, so I do expect security to be a growth driver for us in 2018 all up. Similar set of commentary around switching. Switching has a degree of customer concentration. And we have talked about the fact that this transition, the cloud does have an impact on switching. But I also mentioned in my opening commentary that we're progressing quite nicely in that transition. And as a result of that I do expect switching to be a growth engine for us in 2018 all up. So security and switching I think will be growth technologies for us in 2018. As far as the PTX transition, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making really good progress with now over 80% of the capacity that's being provided to the cloud vertical being PTX oriented. A much smaller number is in the service provider space and that's primarily because of the fact that the use cases and the applications in the service provider space are just not as conducive to a PTX type of architecture. The feature flexibility, the service delivery models and so forth are much more oriented towards the kind of flexibility that the MX provides. Additionally, we continue to invest in the MX. You can expect that there will be product refresh cycles happening in the MX that will improve the economics of the MX over time and provide telcos with the combination of flexibility, services capability that they need at more and more compelling price points. So for that reason there is going to be some shifting but nowhere near what it is for the cloud vertical in the next couple of years. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. This is Tejas on for Steve. Also on cloud, what was the reason cloud surprised? Is the transition happening faster than you previously expected? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, it was a little bit faster than what we expected. I mean, we were at the high end of our range all up. So it's not like it was a huge surprise for us, but it's fair to say that we're pleased with the pace of that transition, right? The new architectures are well understood at this point. The certification for the products and the solution is well underway. In some cases, the new deployments have actually already started. And again as a proof points of that we provided the capacity mix between PTX and the MX. So I think we're just very pleased right now that we are making progress. And the more progress we make, the more confidence we have that we're going to get through this transition throughout the remainder of the year and get back to a year-over-year growth in cloud routing next year. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Let me just move to the cloud switching part here. Rami, you did mention that it was down in the quarter but it did exceed your expectation. So if you can give us a little color on why cloud switching did a little bit better. Was it 100 gig? Was it new customers? And then the second part of that one, can you talk a little bit about the next transition to 400 gig? When do you see that happening? Do you see that as an opportunity, maybe an insertion point to get better in with the cloud? When could we hear more about that? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Certainly Tim. So switching does have a fair degree of concentration especially in the hyperscale cloud providers where we still have a lot more room to grow over time. And I think the 400 gig transition is one that we're very excited about as an opportunity to go into capture share. We expect that to happen sometime next year. We're very much getting ready for it from the standpoint of the systems that are on our road map, the silicon technology that we have chosen, the optics components that will be required to achieve that 400 gig cycle. So all up, I actually am quite excited about 400 gig sometime next year as an opportunity for Juniper to take share. And as far as the switching trends in \u2013 that are happening in Q1 and in the next couple of quarters because of the fact that there is a fair degree of customer concentration in switching and because of the fact that this scale up to scale out transition that we've talked a lot about does have a switching element, we're seeing some cyclicality in the business. I do think that over the next few quarters we should see good solid growth in switching. And all up for 2018, I expect that switching will be up year-over-year. Very confident in the technology across software, silicon and optics that we have in the road map now for our switching product. So this is why I'm actually quite optimistic about switching in 2018. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Hi, guys. I'd like to dig into the gross margin, if I may, if you can quantify the impact, specifically of ASC 606 on gross margin versus other items number one. And number two, the word competition or price pressure isn't mentioned anywhere in the release or your prepared comments. Was that not a factor? Is the pricing environment relatively stable? And how do I think about the potential, what is steady state for you after you get back to volume on gross margins under ASC 606? I'm trying to understand what's the ceiling there. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me start actually with the second question around the pricing dynamics, and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about the gross margins and any impact with ASC 606. The biggest factor that has impacted pricing has actually been this cloud routing transition from MX to PTX. And as you all know, the PTX price per port is meaningfully lower than that of the MX. As we get through more and more of that transition then I expect there to be more normalization of the ASP compression on a year-over-year basis. I don't think from a competitive standpoint there's anything that's meaningfully different in Q1 versus what we saw last year. As this transition from MX to PTX plays out, I do expect that that headwind associated with price compression will start to alleviate. And now I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about gross margins. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. So we are pleased with our gross margin result in Q1, slightly ahead of our midpoint of our guidance. That said, clearly it was down year-on-year and Q-on-Q as we expected it to be. The primary drivers for the decline sequentially would be lower revenue volume, which we talked about a lot last quarter as well as some of the mix issues, both technology mix, routing versus switching as an example, as well as just within routing as we go through this transition. We talked about the PTX product doesn't quite have the same margin level as MX, still a very good margin product above the Juniper average, but not as margin rich as MX. So those are the primary factors that caused this decline Q-on-Q. Going forward, we expect margin to increase with volume. You can see the Q2 guidance is 59%, so that's up sequentially off of Q1. I do expect it to increase throughout the rest of the year with volume. That said, the pace of the improvement could vary as mix will definitely be an impact going forward. So I don't expect the mix factor to normalize throughout the rest of the year. Just really the volume factor would be how I'd model that. From a ASC 606 perspective, there's really no change. I mean we had 58.2% in both ASC 605 and ASC 606. So the margin is the same in total. What is different is product versus service. So although revenue was largely unchanged there's just a $2 million difference between old rules and new rules, you did see approximately $29 million more product revenue and $27 million less service revenue. The cost of goods sold for products and cost of goods sold for service were largely the same. So that shift in revenues resulting in more margin for product, less margin for service, but overall not much of an impact. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Good luck guys. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : Thanks guys. A couple of clarifications and then a question. I'll start with a question. Rami, if I heard you correctly, I forget what you said whether you're expecting weak or a decline in your service provider revenue. I'm just wondering what are the underlying drivers of the disconnect between the calendar 2018 outlook versus service provider CapEx, especially wireline in your expectations. What's driving that? And then Ken, I was hoping for a clarification in terms of -- on the previous question. Is it too early to talk about what you could return to in terms of peak operating, peak gross margin once you get by -- once you get fully by this architectural transition issue? And finally, do you all still -- I think previously you all had indicated that you expect to win a hyperscale cloud customer related to switching by the end of calendar 2018. Is that still the expectation? Thanks guys. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, thanks for the questions. So let me start with the service provider question. The factors that are affecting service provider have largely remained consistent over the last several quarters. Service providers are experiencing top line pressure. There is consolidation in this space. They are really thinking hard about how it is that they're going to move towards cloud-oriented architectures. And Q1 I think was especially challenging for Juniper because we had a couple of large telco customers, especially in North America, that just didn't spend as much as they have historically done. I do expect based on timing of projects, conversations we're having with them that we should see a recovery throughout this year. But it will remain a challenged environment I think for the next year or two. There are some potential catalysts that come our way for service providers. One of them is the conversations now especially on the heels of Mobile World Congress that took place earlier this year around 5G are really increasing. And that's going to require an investment in metro infrastructure to carry the increased capacity level that 5G will drive. It's also very much a cloud-native technology. So we are starting to see, and I would say, especially now in EMEA, an increased number of level of projects oriented around telco cloud that, I think, we are well set up to capture with our Contrail solutions. On the last question about hyperscale, I don't think we talked about any specific timing. In fact, we knew as we entered into the switching space that it would be easier for us to go after the Tier 2 cloud providers, the SaaS providers and the enterprise. And we've seen really solid momentum there that resulted in 25% year-over-year growth for the QFX last year. Hyperscalers are just going to take a little bit more time. We already have some presence in the hyperscalers switching use cases and opportunities, but there's a lot more for us to do. I do think 400-gig presents us with the next big opportunity that we're gearing up for. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On the gross margin question, we continue to focus on innovation and value engineering as well as optimizing our supply chain, pricing discipline and increasing our software mix as well. So there's a lot of company initiatives to drive gross margin up. Quite honestly, at this point it is too early to call 2019. We are looking to have an Analyst Day or Investor Day later in the year where we'll provide more long term color and update, our long term model. But right now the focus on growing gross margin sequentially as volume grows throughout FY 2018. And to that point, I wouldn't \u2013 we're not going to provide full year guidance. But I would encourage you to maintain your revenue and EPS assumptions for the second half that you currently have in your models and that would apply to gross margin as well. Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC : Hey, Rami, can I just clarify something? I'm not challenging your characterization of the carrier environment. But when you look at carriers' plans for spend this year, it actually is the best year in quite some time in the last eight or nine years, especially wireline. You're looking at a 5-plus-percent growth outlook. And I'm just wondering is there anything \u2013 in terms of the product market itself, I would think routing would do that much better. But is there anything going on? Are you just being appropriately conservative? Or is there something else underlying the disconnect in the guidance with that particular routing customers? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, we see the same CapEx reports that you see. And they don't \u2013 carriers, they're not always that clear about how they're going to be investing the CapEx dollars that they talk about as part of their plans. So, again, I would say, we're being cautious and prudent in terms of their spend levels, but we are very much viewing this as an extremely important vertical for us. And we're going to be ready to capture any routing opportunities or telco cloud opportunities with the innovations that we're putting into the market with our carriers. I will say, again, coming out of Mobile World Congress in Q1 of this year, I think, the relationships that we have with our major telco customers worldwide have never been stronger. Operator : Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Hi, guys. I want to go back to the question about carrier routing. Number one is, what do you make of AT&T use of 60,000 white box routers? How does that impact your position in the space? Why don't we see them taking more branded solutions versus white boxes? And is this something that we've seen on the switching side with Arista and they managed to play still in the white box market through software? How are you planning to participate? And is there a room for you to play and participate in the white box market? So that's number one. The second thing is about the hyperscale LAN opportunity not the WAN opportunity. So far you've been mostly presence \u2013 you had presence in the kind of WAN side. And the question is what about the LAN side? Any of your technical progress, any of your new products that address this opportunity better than before? Or what needs to happen for you to participate there? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. So on white box, I believe very strongly that we are innovating in ways that set us up to be very relevant to those that are moving towards white box type solutions. I do also believe that there aren't that many white box type opportunities, especially in the wide area. But to the extent that these become more of a factor, I do think that we are quite frankly leaders in this space. We were the first truly established network technology vendor that disaggregated our operating system. I think many of our customers whether they be telecom operators or cloud providers that are looking at white box are looking to achieve levels of flexibility, new levels of flexibility, programmability and telemetry. And in all of these areas we have disaggregated with a view on solving the specific requirements from our customers. So I don't want to comment about any one customer, but I will say that we're well equipped and well-positioned to participate in the disaggregation capabilities that some of our customers are currently seeking and asking from us. On hyperscale LAN and you're, I'm assuming you're talking about hyperscale datacenter, you're absolutely right that our market share in cloud routing is meaningfully ahead of our market share in cloud, and especially hyperscale cloud switching. We have already made some progress in switching opportunities inside of the hyperscale cloud providers but there is a lot more that we can do. We've learned a significant amount from the introduction of our QFX product line over the last year or two. And now have, yes, a product and solution and technology plan in place across routing, across silicon technology and across optics that I think only increase our ability to penetrate the hyperscale datacenter in the incoming years. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hello. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. My question, I was just reflecting on your prepared comments the \u2013 some of the service provider routing opportunities is kind of delayed by some timing. I'm just curious from a customer point of view, when you talk to some of your bigger telco, cable customers, for example, what's holding them back? What's the timing? Is it some architectural transition? Is it 5G? I want to better understand the timing comment on the prepared comments. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, it really is just a matter of projects typically go through their typical cycles where there is a period of time where they are doing the solution development and the design, the engineering, and then there is a period of time where they're deploying. And Q1 at least for a couple of our largest telco customers, ended up being a bit more of a pause for them. So I don't think there's anything sort of macro level beyond the factors that I've already talked about earlier, it's just really a matter of the timing of where they are with these projects. And it's specific to a few customers. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I would just add. I mean, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for us, from a telco perspective. And what, as Rami mentioned, in this particular quarter, we did see some of our larger customers not deploy. And as you know, we have a fairly high customer concentration in the telco and we have a deployment based revenue model. So it does have impacts to our 90 day results more pronounced than other verticals, and that's what happened in this quarter. It's not something that's really macro related. It's really more Juniper specific. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Certainly, and a quick follow-up for you Ken is OpEx as a percentage of revenue, I mean obviously lots of things are happening here in the horizon 5G etcetera. How should we think about OpEx as a percentage of revenues in the next few quarters? Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we're going to remain prudent on OpEx. That said, we're also going to make sure we invest in right areas to grow long term revenue growth and expand profits. You can see the guide of OpEx for Q2 is the $490 million level, so down off of Q1 levels. I also mentioned in my commentary that I expect OpEx for the full year to be approximately flat. So we believe a flat OpEx for us would be enough for us to invest in the right areas to make sure we focus on long term growth and long term profit. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. I am sorry, Jim, your line is live. Perhaps you could be on mute by accident. And we'll move on, our next is from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. Two questions, if I could. In the cloud routing opportunities that you're talking about right now, the ASPs are clearly coming down significantly. So what sort of growth are you targeting to be able to offset that? I recognize that it's expected to grow by the end of the year. But do you think that you can get revenues back into the neighborhood of where you were in the last couple of years? And then a follow-on question on service provider, if you could comment specifically on pricing within that vertical that would be helpful? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. So on the cloud transition, as I mentioned, we are on or ahead of where we expect to be right now on that transition. A lot of that transition is behind us. There's still more to go as we go through the rest of this year. The more of the transition is in the rearview mirror, with respect to MX and PTX, the more normalization we'll see in ASP compression, right, because the bulk of the ASP pressure comes from the transition from an MX with a certain price per port down to a PTX with a lower price per port. The math starts to work in our favor next year, assuming nothing is different next year for the kinds of port growth that cloud providers are seeing this year and have seen historically. As you know, many of the cloud providers have reported their numbers. They're not seeing any slowdown in their business. Their need to support their customers, from a service delivery experience, is it remains very important. So I truly do believe that this remains a very important and a growth vertical for us that we'll be very much focused on. Pricing in the service provider space, I don't think there's anything out of the normal. It's honestly business as usual. We talked about some of the macro factors around transition to cloud architectures and consolidation and the customer concentration. But from a pricing dynamics it's business as usual. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: It remains a challenging environment, but really no change from previous quarters. Operator : Our next question is from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. One clarification and one question. First, in your cloud segment, you said it's up 4% sequentially, mostly because of routing. But at the same time you're also saying that PTX is down sequentially. So I'm just trying to reconcile that. Is the growth still coming from MX? And if so, how sustainable that is? And then Rami, you talked a little bit about the enterprise and financial verticals being relatively healthy on the switching side. If you could give us a bit more color as to what's driving that? Is that an upgrade cycle, or is it just the environment being a little bit healthier? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with your question around enterprise, and then I'll ask Ken to comment on your first question. What we saw in enterprise is strength in our federal vertical, financial services. Certain geos as well like Australia was actually a good market for us in the Q1 timeframe. I think we're leading with a software oriented cloud based solution. And that's leading to a good ability for us to position our switching, our routing, and our security. And the fact is, as you saw, the security actually was a good performer for us in the Q1 timeframe. We announced just a few weeks ago, a solution that helps enterprises solve the problem that is top of mind for most CIOs that I talk to, which is the ability to move to a multicloud environment with ease and with peace of mind on security, and that's exactly what Contrail Enterprise Multicloud seeks to solve for our customers. We've also complemented the solutions and the technology with a go to market motion where we are specifically targeting new logos and especially large enterprise logos. And I think all of this effort is coming to bear in some good results that we've seen now over the last couple of quarters. And I expect \u2013 I'm quite optimistic about enterprise for the rest of the year as a result. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and on the first question, so the cloud vertical was up sequentially. PTX was up year-over-year but down sequentially. The difference is the PTX was up within the cloud but it was down with the service provider space. So if you look at PTX, we still sell a fair amount to both service provider and cloud. The cloud vertical was up for PTX sequentially and the service provider vertical was down sequentially for PTX. Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the security question firstly. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 it seems like you're getting good combination of results of targeting new customers and with your new portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about what (00:42:39) most of those new customers, is it specifically the opportunity or abilities around multicloud, or just elaborate that a little bit? And then my second question is related to M&A. You've mentioned a couple of times that you're looking at places to invest, et cetera. How should we think about (00:43:00) may factor into your investment plans? Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I appreciate the question. In security, what I liked about our results is that they were fairly broad based in nature across our technologies and our use cases. So we've now refreshed our mid range portfolio and started to see momentum there. We've refreshed our brands portfolio and seeing good momentum there. We also saw good high-end momentum, primarily as a result of cloud customers. We're seeing also a nice diversity of use case between data centers and next generation firewall. And the million dollar plus opportunities that we track are growing nicely. And the last thing, I'd say about security is we're seeing good software attach. The layer four to seven software attach, which we track closely, which is, I think, a good sign of the value that we're offering to our customers is growing now on a year-over-year basis. I do expect based on the pipeline that we're seeing that we should see full year growth for security. On the M&A side, we primarily look for an organic approach to our innovation but at the same time we have good healthy balance sheet. We're generating cash and we would look for opportunities to accelerate our strategy, especially around the cloud, around the enterprise cloud and so on. So there is an opportunity for value enhancing strategy accelerating M&A. We view that as fair game to consider. Operator : Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question and good quarter. Just curious as to what you're seeing related to SD-WAN today and how we should think about the impact throughout the year and kind of moving forward. And then secondly just kind of making sure we're dotting our i's and crossing our t's, was there any pull forward of the switching business this quarter? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me address the first question about SD-WAN. So we view the SD-WAN opportunity as a fantastic opportunity. But we actually look at SD-WAN a little bit different than most of our peers out in the industry. We look at SD-WAN as a very important feature or element of a broader solution around cloud CPE, where we're offering not just an easy managed solution for connectivity but also one that offers security embedded and the ability to leverage third-party virtual network function. We are initially targeting our service provider customers as a way of enabling them to go after the SD-WAN market opportunity. That way we get to leverage the great relationships we have with our service providers. We also can leverage their go-to-market muscle that can complement our own in going after the enterprise end users. This year is really around wins and deployments. And we have, I believe, I mentioned in the last earnings call now three major telco wins. And we are in the process of deploying the solutions, so that we can take it to market by the end of the year and start seeing some revenue growth next year. I think it's early days in terms of SD-WAN. I know it gets a lot of press and attention, but it's still in the beginning stages of the total opportunity and we're excited about it. I think we start to see some revenue from it in a meaningful way next year. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On your second question, we don't believe there's any pull into Q1 from a switching perspective. In fact, I do believe switching will grow sequentially from Q1 levels throughout the year and return to full year growth in the second half of FY 2018. And again it should be a full year growth FY 2018 over FY 2017. So we see the switching momentum only improving throughout the rest of the year. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead. I'm sorry. Dmitry, your line is live. Perhaps, you could be muted. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, I apologize for that. Can you hear me okay now? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking this question, Rami and Ken, appreciate it. So a multipart question, if I may, here. First on the sales transition or the Head of Sales transition, can you give us an update where you are on that search and whether or not there's some key sales departures that you've been witnessing in the process or not? That would be sort of one topic I wanted to touch on. Secondly, you mentioned you repatriated $2.5 billion in cash out of the $3.4 billion. So how much cash is still sitting overseas, and whether there was any urgency in this repatriation as you kind of look into the M&A spectrum? Or is this you're just being opportunistic? And then lastly, if I may, kind of beating the dead horse again on price pressure. I know you noted there's no significant change from prior quarter. It's always been tough, et cetera, in the service provider market. But I wanted to ask the question specifically as it relates to CommScope, which reported earlier this morning, and had noted some commodity price increases and specific price pressure from North American carriers across mobility and connectivity businesses, and whether you could see anything incremental from that standpoint as it relates to your business? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, thanks Dmitry for the questions. First on your question around Head of Sales, I think we're in the middle of the process right now. There's not much I can really say about it other than the fact that we have a great set of sales executives, fantastic bench strength. Our existing Head of Sales, Vince Molinaro is seeing -- is making sure to see that there is an orderly transition. So I'm quite pleased with the progress that we're making and expect it to be a smooth transition to a new Head of Sales when we identify that individual. And as part of your second question around pricing pressure, stand by what we said already. There is nothing out of the ordinary from a service provider standpoint in terms of the pricing dynamics. In the cloud space, the biggest factor is just the mix as we go from MX to PTX. And that subsides as we go through the rest of the transition that we see ahead for us. But in the ASP space again no new news there. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, on the tax question, we did repatriate $2.5 billion in Q1. We still have 35% of our cash offshore, so roughly $1.2 billion is offshore. We expect to repatriate another $500 million or so late this year or early next. From an urgency perspective I wouldn't call it urgent. I think it's just good business practice to bring it back onshore. We did pay the full tax liability for all of our offshore cash in Q4 last year, so from a tax perspective that's behind us on the expense side. And just bringing it onshore just gives us more flexibility, but I wouldn't categorize it as urgent for any sort of pending M&A or anything. It's really just more good hygiene. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for all your questions. That concludes today's call. Excellent! Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.",

Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations. Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our 2Q 2018 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better-than-expected results during the June quarter. Total revenue of $1,204 million was at the high end of our guidance, as strong results in our Enterprise business complemented seasonal sequential improvements in our Cloud and Service Provider verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 exceeded the high end of our guidance due to higher revenue, gross margin improvement and continued cost discipline. While our Q2 results were better than guidance, I'd like to provide some insight into our Q3 forecast, which is being impacted by the following factors. First, we experienced a strong close to the June quarter, and some of the Enterprise business we expected to close in Q3 happened a bit sooner than we previously anticipated. Second, the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider orders we had expected in Q3 are taking a bit longer to materialize, although some are likely to contribute later this year. We remain confident that we are holding or expanding our footprint, and in many cases, gaining mindshare at our most important customers. My confidence is based on the rich conversations we're having with these customers, as well as strong pipeline for the December quarter. These factors are not only leading us to believe that our soft Q3 forecast is mostly a function of timing, but that we remain on track to see a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter. I'm confident that we have the right products and strategy to win across our core verticals, and we are continuing to innovate with a goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share. In this regard, we expect to bring a number of new innovations to market over the next few quarters, including the industry's first 400-gig optimized routing platform, new programmable high-performance MX systems and line cards, an upgrade to our SRX High-End Firewall offering and an industry-leading, multi-cloud orchestration and telemetry platform, each of which, we believe, will help strengthen our position across our core markets. Now for a few highlights of the quarter. Our Enterprise business experienced strong momentum during the June quarter, growing 9% year-over-year, marking the 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Strength was broad-based across geographies, verticals and technologies. While we expect some seasonality during Q3, we believe our Enterprise momentum remained strong due to execution and a compelling portfolio of Enterprise offerings. We saw a modest sequential improvement in the Cloud vertical, where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms. While this process is creating year-over-year ASC pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress through this transition, despite some lumpiness in the business. As evidence of our progress, I would like to highlight that our cloud routing business experienced a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth during the June quarter. Our PTX products accounted for approximately 80% of cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10-gig equivalent basis during Q2, compared to roughly 60% a year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs continue to see signs of stabilization on a sequential basis, a trend we think is likely to continue through the rest of the year. Based on the feedback from our customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer set's rising network requirements. Our Service Provider business experienced normal seasonal trends during the June period. While we expect our Service Provider sales to decline sequentially during the September quarter, we do see the potential for some improvement during the December period, due to the expected timing of deployment. We are continuing to innovate in this vertical and differentiate our solutions relative to those of our peers. We believe these efforts are resonating in the market and should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with Metro initiatives and 5G build-outs, which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. Now I would like to summarize our performance across Routing, Switching and Security. In Routing, our business increased sequentially, but declined year-over-year. While the architectural transition within the cloud continued to present year-over-year headwinds, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth during the June period due to strong uptake of several new products and a seasonal recovery in our Service Provider business, which bounced back following a soft Q1. Though cloud customers are transitioning to our PTX platform, we're not seeing this dynamic in our Service Provider vertical, due to the need for service creation capabilities the MX provides. In Switching, our business increased quarter-over-quarter, but declined year-over-year. While our concentrated hyperscale switching business declined year-over-year on a difficult comparison due to the same scale out architectural transition impacting Routing, excluding this business, we saw high single-digit growth, including double-digit growth in QFX. Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain well-positioned to compete across industry verticals, including Cloud and hyperscale accounts. The strength of our Switching portfolio was recently validated by being named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. In Security, our business grew 16% year-over-year, representing a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our portfolio remains very competitive and remain optimistic that our Security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year, 2018. We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which grew 28% year-over-year. We're seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including three global Tier 1 carriers and a Fortune 500 Enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, and we expect our Enterprise Multicloud capability will begin shipping this quarter. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction with new wins in the Service Provider and Enterprise verticals. While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services revenue to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and a tax rate of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced 9% growth year-over-year. In summary, while our business remains lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident that we are on track to deliver a return to growth by the end of the year. We believe we are innovating in ways which truly matter to our customers. We are executing on the right side of change in our industry and positioning the business to see improved long-term success. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter were better than expected with a total second quarter revenue of $1.204 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 59.1%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48; all above the midpoint of our guidance. We saw sequential growth across all verticals, led by Enterprise, which increased 20%, driven by the growth in all technologies. Enterprise also posted its 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth at 9%. The Service Provider vertical was up 9% sequentially, in line with seasonal trends, and declined 7% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without this revenue recognition change, Service Provider would have been essentially flat year-over-year. Cloud revenues increased 4% sequentially, but declined 26% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects continued architectural headwinds and the pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in our position with our strategic cloud customers. However, the timing of deployments may continue to vary. During the quarter, Routing and Switching both increased to double-digits sequentially, and the positive momentum in Security continued, growing 9% quarter over quarter. Security posted a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 16%. Our Switching business declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the weakness in Cloud and Service Provider. Routing saw a 14% decline year-over-year, primarily due to the ongoing architectural shift in Cloud. PTX grew on a year-over-year basis. In reviewing our top-10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and one was in Enterprise. Product deferred revenue declined in the second quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 13% year-over-year. For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to higher revenue, while the year-over-year decline was primarily related to mix and lower revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, and 1% year-over-year, due to prudent cost management. Cash flow from operations was $170 million for the quarter, a decline of $128 million year-over-year, and $101 million sequentially. These declines reflect lower collections and higher tax payments. The higher tax payments are a result of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the first of eight annual installments related to the transition tax. In addition, we paid $63 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the June quarter was $3.5 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter. Before we move on to the question and answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our Investor Relations site. Our Q3 revenue guidance reflects stronger-than-expected Q2 business, particularly in Enterprise, as well as the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider deployments which are taking longer to materialize. In addition, we are working through some industry-wide supply constraints related to certain power management components, which could further impact our lead times in Q3. At this time, we believe we will be largely able to mitigate this issue. Therefore, it is not a significant factor within our guidance. However, it could impact our future results. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect to return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter to remain stable in Q3 and improve with volume over time. However, the pace of this improvement could be impacted by mix, as well as other factors. We expect annual non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Yeah, just a question and a clarification; so just on the Cloud delays, maybe if you could just talk a little bit, Rami, about maybe how broad across the customer base are those delays; is it just one or two customers and kind of what the root cause is. Is it just still testing the product or is there something else at bay there? I'm assuming you don't think it's looking at other solutions \u2013 competitive solutions. And then secondly, on the Cloud topic, can you talk a little bit about Switching and trying to get a little bit more traction into the Cloud vertical and the hyperscale players and maybe touch on where you're thinking the insertion point would be, and does 400 gig help you there \u2013 give you a window into that customer base? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. So, good set of questions. First, as far as the cloud routing goes and our position with cloud routing, it's the same architectural shift we've been talking about, 10 gig to 100 gig scale-out. Certainly, a platform transition from MX to PTX, that are all coming to bear. Our view \u2013 coming into the year, our view of the full year in terms of that transition has always been this is going to take multiple quarters, and it's playing out that way. Predicting exactly when the big deployments are going to happen, especially internationally, as data centers get deployed around the globe, is easier said than done. However, I do want to just make sure that you all understand, I remain very confident that we are in an extremely strong position with our Cloud customers. As you just heard from Ken, 6 of our 10 top customers in Q2 were, in fact, Cloud customers were already designed into many of the next generation networks that need to be deployed. You asked about, sort of, how broad-based or not; well, we're talking about hyperscalers here, so it only takes a couple of customers to move the needle pretty significantly. Certification of our software and our products, for the most part, have either already been completely done or is getting completed and the conversations with our customers at \u2013 down at the engineering level have never been stronger. And finally, maybe the last data point I'll offer is just that we've seen abnormally rapid ASP declines as a result of the MX to PTX transition over the last several quarters, but now that's starting to stabilize, which is a good indication of the fact that at least a good part of that transition is behind us. So, all of these factors give me a lot of confidence that this is more a quarter timing issue than it is anything more fundamental than that. I do not believe it's a competitive issue. And then on your question around Switching, I'm glad you asked it because I still believe that Switching is an incredible opportunity for us to take share in the large cloud or Tier 1 cloud vertical. We're already seeing great momentum in the Enterprise, validated now by being in the leader's quadrant in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Networking; we are seeing really good and solid momentum in the Tier 2 space; we are looking at the 400-gig inflection point that is coming next year as an opportunity for us to take share in hyperscale switching; and we've announced a broad set of products, 400-gig interfaces, across all of our Routing and Switching portfolio, as well as two new platforms, Routing and Switching, that will be available before the end of this year that are 400-gig optimized. So, our intention of capturing that wave early is playing out as we expect, and I think that's going to be very helpful for us. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about maybe levers that influence your gross margin, and in particular, what I'm trying to really get to is, in the fourth quarter, when you expect to return to year-over-year growth, it would imply improved volume. And so, I'm just trying to get an idea, how much of the gross margin would be driven by volume versus mix? Thank you. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Simon. Good questions. So as we we've been stating, the decline this year is largely both volume and mix related; volumes should recover, and we expect Q4 to be growth year-on-year as you mentioned. However, the mixed headwinds that we've seen, namely the Switching in becoming a bigger piece of overall revenue stream, as well as the MX to PTX, some of those mix headwinds on the product side will not recover this year. I do expect us to grow margin beyond this year as volume grows and mix kind of stabilizes, but I don't expect a recovery beyond that. We'll see some improvement from volume, but we won't get back to FY2017 levels because the mixed impacts will remain throughout this year. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And just as a follow up, I wanted to see if you could quantify the software business. I think, in the past, you've given us a couple metrics; I think 2015 was 3%; 2017, if I recall, 6% of revenue from software; I just want to see where we are today to help me understand the baseline. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so those metrics still hold, and we did say this quarter we grew software 27% year-on-year. So our software business continues to outpace the rest of our businesses actually, from a growth perspective, and we're very excited about the opportunity. We've talked \u2013 we've recently talked a lot about the Contrail Enterprise Multicloud product that we announced earlier this year; that should be shipping soon, and we think that's going to drive a lot of momentum in the whole Enterprise data center solution, which is really a software-led solution. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But as a portion of revenue, it's below 10%, but above the 6% last year? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you, gentlemen. I was hoping to dial a little bit in to the Service Provider side that you mentioned in the third quarter guidance. What are the dynamics that are going on there and, in the back of my mind, of course, Verizon seems like they're being a bit more aggressive on price, so that's more of a sustainable shift rather than a push-out by a quarter or so. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. Let me start and maybe Ken has some additional comments. I think, honestly, it's more of the same when it comes to the Service Provider space. We did see a good sequential recovery from a Q1 low, but generally speaking, the dynamics in the market are around telcos being prudent with their spend, consolidation, M&A activity, unlimited data plans, that are all putting pressure on their ability to invest. Now, we see the same CapEx reports that you saw coming out of the large Tier 1 telcos, which suggest that second half would be better than the first half. I do believe that will translate to better dynamics for Juniper, specifically. I'm optimistic from a new architecture and new solutions standpoint for telcos, but this is going to play out over the next several years. Examples would be, all telcos are looking at deploying some form of a telco cloud, from which they will deliver next-generation services to the Enterprise or for 5G, and Juniper is quickly developing a reputation of being a trusted advisor to the deployment of such telco cloud initiatives. And in fact, we just won another Tier 1 telco in Europe, which is rolling out this sort of telco cloud to offer next-generation services, and we're very proud of that. I think there could be other catalysts like 5G deployments in Metro, but quite frankly, this is not something that we're modeling into our assumptions over the next few quarters. It's something that we're hopeful will help over the next couple of years. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: The only thing I would add is while we do expect a modest decline sequentially in Q3, we do expect the second half in our Service Provider to be stronger than the first half. So, it's just kind of a timing game at this point. From a pricing perspective, we aren't seeing anything beyond normal when it comes to pricing pressure; it's always been a heightened pricing pressure environment, but we aren't seeing anything unusual at this point from a pricing perspective. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thanks, Ken. And then would you mind reminding us where we are with the headwinds from memory pricing and maybe we'll start \u2013 if we might see the benefit of that as memory pricing starts to improve over the next few quarters? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so at this point, it's been stable all year. We expect it to remain stable throughout this year. We could see some favorable pricing beginning next year, but at this point we're seeing stable. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Thank you, both. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate you taking the question. I heard the response to the last question, but Rami, Ken, I just want to make sure, with the new MX platform and with telcos having observed what the cloud hyperscale folks have been doing, you're not expecting any significant step-down in pricing, and the new MX platform doesn't, on a like-for-like basis, if we look at per-port pricing, clearly from your comments, there's not going to be that type of step-down or anything close to it. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Paul, and I'm glad you asked. The answer is, yes, you're right, I do not anticipate anything remotely close to the kind of transition that we've seen from MX to PTX in the Cloud space; and it's primarily a matter of the kinds of services that telcos are typically delivering over the MX \u2013 and it's playing out as we expect. I mean, we monitor the MX to PTX ratio both in the Cloud as well as in other verticals, especially the telco vertical, and they just look very, very different. But beyond that, the MX itself will see a substantial amount of innovation that will enhance not only its programmability, but its performance as well as the economics on a per-bit basis in each line card. We just recently announced a new silicone generation, the Penta Silicon generation for the MX that will start to ship in the early part of next year that brings all of the tens of thousands of MX chasses that are deployed now around the world, an opportunity for an upgrade. And I think that just reduces the incentives for many of the telcos to move aggressively to another platform like the PTX. I'll just close by saying, every time we have introduced a next-generation of line cards for the MX that bring up the performance and reduce the cost per bid, we've seen a pretty substantial uptick as a result, again, of the wide deployed base, and we're anticipating the same sort of thing in the first part of next year. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: And, Rami, if we look further longer term for Service Provider routing, given the pressures in that market from a secular standpoint as well as the competitive dynamics, it seems like most of you folks accuse (00:27:10) yourself, others are all talking about share gain. What's your best guess as to what the longer-term outlook from a growth perspective? Are you hoping to run in place, hoping to grow the business? Or should we just expect modest decline? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, I think the TAM for telco routing will be under pressure for the next couple of years, as I've mentioned, for the variety of reasons I just articulated. However, the way I look at the telco space and our opportunity in the telco space is in a couple of ways. First, we have to be very relevant to the next-generation solutions that they're deploying, especially around virtualization and SDN; and I think we are very quickly gaining a lot of momentum there. But beyond that, I think there is an opportunity to expand in more traditional routing by penetrating accounts that are mostly international where our footprint remains very low, and there are those accounts in Europe and especially in Asia Pacific. So, I think the combination of a go-to-market strategy that we are wrapping around that opportunity, an alliance and partnership strategy that we are putting in place to help us in expanding our reach internationally, as well as the new product portfolio that we are now introducing into the market around the PTX and the MX, I think we have a real opportunity to do that. So it's really around net new footprint, especially internationally, where we have much less penetration or market share all up is our opportunity. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, I wanted to come back to the telco architectures a little bit, Rami. Thanks for all the clarification on where you see that; I'm curious about the 5G fixed wireless trials and then commercial rollouts that are coming up. What do you think Juniper's participation in that is and how that architecture might be changing? Do you expect the MX to be used as much there as it is elsewhere? So, that's the first question, just kind of clarifying the telco stuff. And then, Ken, I wanted to come back to the power management parts commentary that you had and just ask \u2013 I think you referred to MLCCs (00:29:43) there; if you guys are able to source them, most people think prices are going up a lot and we don't really know how much content you guys have on average. So, I'm just curious what the margin impact of that is; is there one, or if you can source them, it's not as material for margins. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Let me start with the question around 5G, which is a good question. First, 5G is going to be, in our view, very much a cloud-native architecture, which means that the infrastructure to support 5G services is going to be built on a distributed telco cloud. And in many ways, we're already participating in these next-generation telco cloud solutions and projects with our customers in preparation for 5G. I anticipate that will only accelerate as 5G deployments start to happen more fully and around the globe next year. Secondarily, we've always had a strong position in Security for telcos, and in particular, mobile security; and we've seen, as you saw from our results, pretty good momentum in Security now for the third quarter in a row. That has largely come from data center and Enterprise and actually, less so from telco yet, because we haven't yet refreshed our next-generation firewalls for the high-end, and in particular, for the mobile telco opportunity. That happened this quarter, and as a result of that, we anticipate we're going to be in a fantastic position to take advantage of Security projects, in particular, to get ready for, you know, advancements to 4G or 5G. And then, finally, it's just the transport opportunity. 5G is going to be around far more capacity that has to be transported in the Access, in the Metro, and in the Core; and we are starting to see more Metro projects that are out there that we are competing for, and our goal, again here, would be to take share. I mentioned just earlier, around our alliance and partnership strategy, we are working very closely with alliance partners with a goal of being well-prepared from a go-to-market standpoint to achieve or to compete for such opportunities as they come about. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. And from a supply-constraints perspective, Rod, as we talked about, we do believe we will be able to mitigate the risk, but there could be some timing risk as related to lead times, et cetera. On a margin perspective, they're a very small piece of our overall cost of goods sold, so we don't anticipate any impact to our cost of goods sold or margins due to this issue. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to first ask about the cloud routing business. PTX has been around 80% of cloud routing for the last couple of quarters. So does it sort of stabilize here or is there a bit more to go in terms of the mix shift? And, additionally, with the cloud providers, I think you mentioned that there was a sequential slowdown in Security revenues. Is there any trend to that? Is there something particularly driving that? Or is it more of a one-off this quarter? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Samik. So, on the cloud routing side, yes, I mean, we're sort of hovering around 80% for the last couple of quarters. I do expect that when the bulk of the transition is behind us, it will actually be more than 80% that will move to PTX, but the fact that it's sort of hovering around 80% would at least suggest that we're starting to stabilize. And the second data point that I offered is just ASPs; ASPs themselves are no longer declining as rapidly as they were just a couple of quarters ago when the transition from MX to PTX was happening far more rapidly. We've always said this transition is going to happen over several quarters. That's exactly what's happening. I think by next year, the bulk of it will be behind us, and we should start to see year-over-year growth in that timeframe. And then your question about Security, I don't believe I said anything about Security specifically for Cloud. What I did say is, in Security, we're seeing really good momentum in the branch, in the midrange; we're seeing good Security for next-gen firewall for data center and campus. What we have not yet seen is good growth in Security is primarily because of the fact that our portfolio needs a refresh. It is due for a refresh; it's in the high end. Now, that high end for Security is primarily used for mobile applications in the telcos and some applications for large data centers, and that changes in the second half of this year as we introduce a new platform. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, in my commentary I did mention that the sequential strength in Security was Enterprise-led and it was offset partially by some Cloud from a sequential basis. It wasn't a material offset, but there was some offset. I wouldn't call it a trend; it was just timing of deployments from a Cloud Security perspective, not something that we perceive being a new trend going forward. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. So our Security business for the cloud providers has always been very lumpy because it is so concentrated in \u2013 with a few number of customers. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Got it. That's what I was referring to. Thanks for that clarification. Can I just ask, you mentioned some, sort of, pull-forward of revenues from Q3 to Q2 that's impacting the Q3 outlook here; is there any way of quantifying the pull-forward in terms of the strong close to the quarter that you had with Enterprise customers; sort of to give us a fair idea of what kind of impact on Q3 is from that? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So the way I've looked at it is, we exceeded our \u2013 the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $30 million, and most of that was related to some better Enterprise performance than we expected going in the quarter; and we think that will have a negative impact to the Q3 Enterprise result as it gets \u2013 the sequential pattern is going to be a little more Q2-focused and a little less Q3 on the Enterprise side. But that kind of describes the magnitude that we're talking about. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Hey, Rami, Ken, how is it going? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I have a bigger-picture question on 400 gig \u2013 I mean, congratulations on the product launch. I want to get your understanding of when is the earliest revenue quarter and then also would 400 gig mostly be incremental to you or would it cannibalize or replace any of the other footprint you have, for example, 100 gig at any of the Cloud companies? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. Good question. So, I am very excited about the 400 gig opportunity all up. I mean, Juniper has always been very strong when it comes to high-performance networking, and 400 gig, it represents the next big market opportunity for high-performance networking that's true for the wide area \u2013 it's certainly true for the data center. There's always some level of cannibalization, right? I mean, we've seen this in the transition to 10 gig to 100 gig and to 400 gig. As customers start to adopt 400 gig, the demand for 100 gig will start to subside, but this plays out over many years. And all up, I expect it to be much more of an opportunity than anything else for Juniper. And that is, in particular, as it relates to the cloud space, the cloud provider space and especially in the switching. So, we wanted to make sure that we introduce a holistic 400-gig strategy across our entire product portfolio. The two platforms \u2013 actually more than two, but the platforms that we introduced are just announced, that we'll introduce into the market before the end of the year, are quite honestly just teasers of what's to come that leverage next-generation merchant silicon, as well as next-generation Juniper silicon in both routing and in switching, that will provide for 400-gig readiness. As soon as the 400-gig optics are going to be available on the market, our customers will have an opportunity to deploy in use cases where that kind of capacity is required. The optics, we anticipate, will enter into the market in the Q1 timeframe, and then the build-outs will start to happen slowly throughout 2019. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on for Ken on gross margins; Ken, what will get the margins to creep up? Is it just better unit volumes or are you going to apportion your COGS better? Is it \u2013 I don't know, any more offshore (00:39:00) portfolio in the mix? Just want to get your view of margins; how should we think of it heading into the second half? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so the most immediate uptick will be primarily volume-related. Beyond that, we have a lot of value engineering efforts underway, a lot of their software \u2013 so software continues to be a bigger piece of overall revenue. That will clearly be margin positive, and you know, pricing discipline and supply chain optimization and all of these efforts will be focused on as well. But I would say that the short-term margin growth should be mostly volume. Beyond that, it's going to be primarily product innovation led with some other discipline in the supply chain. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, let me just add to that, Vijay. So, we have said that one of the contributors to gross margin pressure had been mix shift, and in particular, the shift of routing to switching. We have also, very deliberately, learned a lot from our QFX switching deployments around the world, especially with the cloud providers, and all of those lessons have now fed their way into our product innovation pipeline, especially the silicon technology that we're developing or procuring from our \u2013 for our merchant silicon vendors, to capture the next wave of switching, especially data center opportunity. So that's what Ken means when he talks about innovation. You can't \u2013 that won't help immediately, but I'm confident that the lessons learned and the changes that we've made in our next-generation products will help quite a lot from a gross margin standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for the question. I wanted to take a moment to just discuss Contrail and multi-cloud deployments. When customers use Contrail to deploy in to multiple clouds, are they also opting into your hardware products? And if so, like, what are they using? What I'm really trying to get at are, what are the hardware components of choice for this type of deployment? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. It's a great question. Let me start. First, the primary use cases for Contrail have thus far been for NFV-type deployments inside of telcos and really large enterprises that almost behave like service providers. And those deployments, they take quite a bit of time to get them stood up, to get the services up and running and so forth; and that has been the primary driver of our Contrail business to date. And we've seen great momentum, not necessarily from a revenue as a percentage of total Juniper revenue, but from the standpoint of mindshare with our customers from the standpoint of pull-through of hardware like switching, routing and security. And all the strategic conversations we're having with telcos around that, the distributed telco cloud opportunity starts with Contrail. So, what we have done recently is, we've announced a product that is based on Contrail that's called Contrail Enterprise Multicloud; just recently announced it and it actually gets shipped into the market within the next few weeks. And what that does is that it broadens the opportunity for Contrail substantially, and especially in the Enterprise space. Every CIO \u2013 or most CIOs I talk to on an ongoing basis, is in some way, shape, or form, thinking about how to move to a multi-cloud environment that includes some combination of private cloud and a variety of public cloud. But they're looking for solutions to do that with simplicity and with security. And we believe firmly that Contrail Enterprise Multicloud is the best solution for that problem. And yes, there's absolutely a pull-through opportunity there because once you have that strategic control point within the Enterprise, the conversation shifts to the switching infrastructure for the private cloud, security, both physical and virtual, in the private cloud and public cloud, as well as potentially even routing to connect private to public cloud. So that is the strategy that we're embarking on. I'm super-excited about the products we're going to be introducing into the market just very shortly. The initial interest and the proof of concepts we've been doing with our customers has been very encouraging. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you for the color on that. And then maybe just to touch on the comment you just made regarding the security enablement side, when they go into public clouds or multiple public clouds is, should we expect the attach rate of your Security business to pick up in this transition versus like the legacy business? Or how could you \u2013 I'm just trying to quantify this or even think about how this would work from an attach rate perspective. Just, maybe if you give us like a point of reference. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, it is a very good question, and we certainly do think of it in that way. I look at Security on a couple of different horizons. There's the here-and-now around physical firewalls, and that's where we're mostly seeing the momentum we've seen over the last three quarters or so. And there's been a tremendous amount of work in making our product portfolio in the firewall space more competitive, as well as some real intense focus in go-to market that has led to that momentum. The second horizon of security is not so much about the physical perimeter, which essentially becomes less relevant over time. It really becomes around securing workloads, applications in a private and public cloud, and that now becomes a great opportunity for our virtual security products. Our virtual SRX, our containerized SRX, which work seamlessly with Contrail's Enterprise Multicloud to offer that multi-cloud solution. At some point, I think we can talk to you about quantifying the pull-through. We're not prepared to do that now. I think maybe we can do that at the Analyst Event that we'll host in the second half of this year. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you so much for the color. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, there. Thanks a lot, guys. Hey, I wanted to ask, going back to the mixture of PTX among Cloud Routing business, I think you said 80%, and it's been there a couple of quarters. You said it's going to continue to drift up above 80%. I guess, I'm wondering how you think about the timing for that. Do you say that because you have specific visibility into some cloud customers migrating off of MX and onto the PTX? Or is that more just a hunch you have? And I guess, I'm wondering what the timing of that would look like. Is that something that's baked into your guidance for the second half of the year in terms of revenue and margins? Thanks a lot. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. George, no, it's based on more than a hunch; I would say it is based on an understanding that the design wins that we have with some of our really large cloud providers include a combination of PTX and next-generation QFX switching, and we're still early innings. The new architectures are sort of \u2013 we are completing, as I mentioned, the certification process; we're ready for deployment. It really now comes down to when the deployments happen holistically, internationally, which is difficult to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I have high degree of confidence that we're on the receiving end of the build-out. And that's what leads me to believe that over time, the PTX percentage will drift up. It will never be 100% because even within the cloud space, there will be a variety of use cases where the MX is the only platform \u2013 or the platform that makes the most sense for those specific use cases, but I do anticipate it drifting up from 80% of it. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and we think it will take you several more quarters. The transition will happen for a couple of years. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: It's a couple of years, but enough of the transition... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Is behind us. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: ...will be behind us, we believe, by the end of this year; so that by the next year, year-over-year growth in Cloud becomes very possible. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : All right. Super. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Kisner, Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. So, a little different tack here; so, obviously, the current situation, you know, with tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries is dynamic and changing, and recognizing you guys are fortunate enough not to be doing a lot of business in China, I'm just wondering, can you comment on any impact you've seen thus far on your supply chain, input costs, customer demand to the extent you've seen so far? How are you thinking about the risks or opportunities to your business going forward amidst the ongoing kind of the trade situation? Thanks. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so at this point, the tariffs that have been implemented have had basically no impacts to our business. Clearly, we're monitoring the situation closely. If there are additional tariffs, they could be impactful. We are looking at ways to mitigate potential impacts of potential new tariffs, but at this point, there is nothing factored into our \u2013 obviously, our results or our Q3 guidance, because we don't expect there to be a material impact right now, but we will continue to monitor and adapt as necessary going forward. James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And just separately, you talked about a lot of innovation in your portfolio coming down the pike here; do you anticipate any potential wait-for effect or Osborne effect as they call it? Have you factored that at all into your business? Any thoughts there at all? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'm not concerned about that because a lot of the innovations that we've announced have been really around 400-gig optimized platforms in routing and in switching. I think we intentionally wanted to capture that opportunity in the very early phases, but from a demand standpoint, it will happen over time. So, I'm not too concerned about cannibalization or Osborning. James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I just had two quick questions; Ken, if you said it, I apologize and I missed it, but can you help us quantify a little bit the impact of ASC 606 on the Q3 margins and revenue, et cetera? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: On Q2, I presume, you mean? Or on Q3? James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On Q3, going forward. Was it impacting your \u2013 the formulation of your guidance at all? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no. So the guidance was all based on new ASC 606 rules. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not doing a forecast under the old rules. We have converted the company to the new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of. Any given quarter, there could be a small impact. Q2, the net impact was about $17 million. I would consider that a small impact. There's potential for that to go the other direction in Q3 or go to a similar direction. So we are really pivoting the business under new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then, I guess, maybe a broader question, Rami, on Security. Obviously, the way that you've talked about it in terms of the changing dynamic and approach of Security, I'm just wondering, is that also changing your sales motion and are you having to engage with different people, or are the networking leaders becoming more involved in security decision-making yet in your sales process? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question. So, certainly, you can't see this kind of momentum with just product innovation alone. We have upped our focus in go-to market. We have built a specialist team that focuses entirely on Security and talks to the Security buyers within our customers. We've created incentives out in the field around Security and then, finally, I think the thing that's working really well for us is solution sales. As we go to our customers and talk about a next-generation cloud architecture, I think we have now learned to talk not just about the switching component of that cloud, but it's really around switching, it's around security, it's around orchestration, multi-cloud, routing, and I think that end-to-end solutions motion has really helped us. When we look at where we are selling security, we're actually \u2013 you'll see a high degree of correlation to accounts where we're also selling other products as well. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from James Fish, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Most of my questions have been answered. The only thing that really hasn't come up today is just your general competition from essentially white box switching. Just curious on your view through the second quarter. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, James. So I would say, not much has changed from our perspective. I think the real benefits for white box that our customers truly care about are flexibility, you know, having the access to different silicon choices, programmability through standards-based interfaces and telemetry, the ability to extract lots of information, and of course, economics; and I truly believe we are ahead of the market in all of these dimensions. We have a CTO, Bikash Koley, that comes from the cloud world that's infusing this kind of thinking throughout our entire company, especially our R&D organization. I think we're innovating on the right side of change for this opportunity right now for us, so more of the same. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then, Ken, maybe for you, on that 9% impact to Service from ASC 606, was that bookings or is that revenue? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Those are revenues. So the Services numbers were all revenue-based. Bookings would have no impact from the ASC 606 to ASC 605 \u2013 ASC 605 to ASC 606 perspective. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. I just had a quick question, a follow-up on your MX refresh next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity; how large of an opportunity do you see that? And then, how do you think about the timing from when that's launched to when we could start to see that impact the model? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the question, Joe. First, in terms of the refresh itself, it's pretty broad-based. It has a number of different dimensions. First and foremost, we're introducing the MX technology both on the hardware and software side to our universal chassis, which is a chassis that supports all different types of use cases and deployments across switching, routing and services delivery. And then we're going to follow that up pretty quickly, in the first part of next year, with new silicone advancements for all of our MX platforms, and there are many deployed out there and a lot of empty slots that we can go and leverage. The biggest opportunity is going to be within the telco space, right? And we have seen this time and time again. I think since the initial introduction of the MX, we probably released around three or four different major iterations of technology, and in each case, we've seen the uptake happen faster as a result of the broader deployed platform that is out there. We're equally optimistic about the opportunity here, specifically in the telco space. In terms of timing, if we introduce it in the first part of next year, typically the certification time will take six months to nine months, that sort of timeframe; some customers that will move faster, but on average, that's the kind of ballpark we'd look at for certification time. Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis, William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you, and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end of the call. I just sort of want to follow-up on this MX to PTX transition, and how this may potentially affect the telco segment. I understand there's an MX refresh coming, but your Cloud now is at, say, 80% transition to PTX. Is there a similar dynamic in telcos? And I know a bunch of your telcos are buying PTX. So, as you kind of look out the next three, five years, what percentage of telco customers do you expect to transition over to PTX versus MX? If there's number there, I would love to hear about that. And is there something in that transition that kind of sucks a lot of this intelligence into the Contrail SDN controller which allows you to \u2013 which allows your customers to potentially to use maybe a less of an intelligent box at the telco level; so in other words, using PTX rather than MX. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the question, Dmitry. So first, I think it's useful to understand that in the cloud provider space, most of the routing applications are primarily around transport. It's not so much about service delivery, it's around connecting data centers together, it's around connecting to peering points in their network; and that's conducive to a real optimized transport product like the PTX. In the telco space, the use cases, there are certainly use cases that are around transport. I mean, Core is mostly around transport and for that reason, we have been selling PTXs there. But if you look over the last few quarters at the mix of MX to PTX within telco, it has not changed all that much. It's more or less stable at a number that's far less than the ratio that's in the cloud. Could the PTX inch up over time? Yes, I think it could, but it will happen at nowhere near the pace it is happening within the telco space. And it's primarily, again, because of the use cases and the services that are delivered. In the telco space, the delineation between transport, movement of packets and service delivery to enterprises or to consumers are \u2013 is usually very fuzzy, which makes it very, very conducive to sell a very flexible platform into that opportunity. It's why the MX has been so successful and why I think the refresh we're going to do for the MX is going to see a lot of success in the telco space. So, again, I do not believe that this transition is going to happen nearly as fast in the telco space over time. I think, maybe, again, at the analyst event, we can provide you some more color on our ratio expectations over time. I don't want to do that on this call right now. Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. I was going to follow up with that. But thank you, I appreciate the detailed explanation. It's very helpful. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Dmitry. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Jess Lubert for closing remarks. Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. We'd like to make you aware that we will be hosting an Analyst Day in New York on November 9. Thank you for all your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q3 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better than expected results during the September quarter. Total revenues of 1.180 million was above the midpoint of our guidance, as continued strength in our enterprise business along with better than expected service provider sales more than offset weakness within the cloud. In addition, gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, while operating expenses came in towards the low end of our forecast, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.54, $0.07 above the high end of our outlook. We're seeing encouraging development in many areas of our business, which are providing confidence in our long term growth prospects. Some of these developments include the following. Our enterprise business continues to see solid momentum, rising 15% year-over-year and growing year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. Strength was experienced across all technologies and we benefited from a diverse base of customers. While our enterprise switching and security business both grew year-over-year, we also saw very strong demand for our enterprise routing portfolio, as new solutions such as the MX204 and the MX10003 are seeing solid success in areas of the market where we previously didn't play. We believe we have the right products and strategy to win in the enterprise markets and we are strengthening our go to market focus on this vertical, under our new Chief Customer Officer, Pierre-Paul Allard. Security was another bright spot in Q3, growing 8% year-over-year and rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. While our breadth of security deals was strong in the period, we were also encouraged to see an uptick in the number of transactions over $1 million. We experienced strong security booking during the September quarter and we remain optimistic, regarding the growth prospects for our security business. While our service provider revenue declined 6% year-over-year, the business grew 4% sequentially and performed better than we expected. We believe the upside relative to our expectations reflects the strengthening of our relationships with many of our top service provider customers who recognize the value of the innovations we're bringing to market. We believe our orchestration telemetry, node slicing cups and universal chassis capabilities are leading the industry and should position us to win with our service provider customers. We are also optimistic regarding the potential of our MX5G offerings, which we spec to begin shipping early next year. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the value that Juniper is offering. We believe this was highlighted at our recent NXTWORK\u2019s user conference, where customer and partner attendance more than doubled year-over-year. We\u2019re excited about new and expanding partnerships with firms like Nutanix and Ericsson, which we expect to not only strengthen our ability to capitalize on multi-cloud and 5G initiatives, but also broaden our reach and drive competitive advantage versus alternative offerings. We're also in the early stages of ramping several important new innovations, such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and the SPC3 line cards for our high end SRX firewall, both of which began shipping in the third quarter. These platforms bring material differentiation to the market and are already seeing strong customer traction, which should prove accretive to growth in future quarters. Not to be overlooked, we're on the verge of introducing the industry's first 400-gig product and believe we will be well positioned to gain share, as cloud, service provider and enterprise customers look to meet surging bandwidth requirements. Our software business had another strong quarter, rising both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and accounting for nearly 10% of our revenue. While this strength was due to several one-time license buys and we do not expect our software business to remain at this level over the next few quarters, we continue to introduce new software solutions to the market and are putting go to market strategies in place in order to drive higher software attach rates in future periods. While we remain optimistic regarding our long term prospects, we are also seeing some challenges in the market, particularly within the cloud vertical where we believe several of our customers are running their networks harder and the pace of deployments are proceeding more slowly than we previously anticipated. Based on our current forecast, we're not expecting a material improvement in cloud revenue during the December quarter, which is the primary reason the midpoint of our revenue forecast no longer embed a return to year-over-year growth in Q4. This weakness relative to our prior forecast is mostly due to our expectations regarding the impact of cloud driving sales and to a lesser extent cloud switching revenue. Although the timing and pace of cloud deployments remains difficult to predict, we maintain a high level of engagement with these important customers and remain confident we are not only holding our cloud footprint, but also positioning to benefit as incremental capacity requirements eventually drive improved demand. As we announced earlier in the quarter, Pierre-Paul Allard joined us as our new Chief Customer Officer. I'm excited to have him on my team and believe the changes we will make under Pierre-Paul\u2019s leadership will help further drive improved sales execution.  In summary, while our business is lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident regarding our pipeline of opportunities and our ability to grow the business in 2019. Perhaps, more importantly, we are innovating in ways, which truly matter to our customers and should position the business to see improved long term success. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the third quarter were better than expected with revenue of $1.180 million, above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 were both above our guidance range.  Our enterprise vertical posted its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 15%, driven by strength across all technologies. The 4% sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonality and in line with our expectations. The service provider vertical declined 6% year-over-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The sequential growth was better than expected, primarily due to strength in EMEA. Cloud revenues declined 28% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The declines reflect a slower than expected pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in opposition with our strategic cloud customers, however, the pace of deployments is difficult to predict. During the quarter, routing saw 15% decline year-over-year, primarily due to cloud, partially offset by strength in Enterprise. Our switching business grew 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Security posted a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 8% and the growth was driven by strength in all verticals. Our services business declined 1% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, services would have increased approximately 6% year-over-year. In reviewing our top ten customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were service provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue declined in the third quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 1% year-over-year. For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 61.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by favorable product mix, including the positive effect of higher software sales and geographic mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $207 million for the quarter, an increase of 6 million year-over-year and $37 million quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower tax payments. Our $750 million ASR, which was initiated in Q1 of this year concluded in the third quarter, resulting in the retirement of an additional 6 million shares in the third quarter. We also paid $62 million in dividends in the third quarter. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of September quarter was $3.6 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter.  Before we move on to the question-and-answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. While we were expecting to return to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the midpoint of our guidance reflects a year-over-year decline. This is due to the slower pace of expected deployments from cloud customers. In addition, while the recently implemented China tariffs are not expected to have a material direct impact on our Q4 \u201818 financial results, customer buying behavior could be affected and gross margin may be slightly impacted. While we expect to see gross margin benefit from volume in the fourth quarter, our guidance is down sequentially due to a more normalized product and geographic mix. We expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to slightly decline on a year-over-year basis. It's also worth noting that the higher interest rates, other income and expense is likely to be lower going forward, in line with our Q3 \u201918 results. While we expect our Q4 \u201918 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%, we believe our go forward non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19% to 20%. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen and two questions for me. I guess number one, could we start on your visibility on the cloud. What can you tell us about the projects and what have you in the past? You've been able to look a little bit further out there one quarter. Perhaps, you can help us understand where the PTX migration is. And when we might be able to expect an uptick? And then secondly, if you could give us a little bit of visibility into the 400-gig cycle and what -- how you expect that to play out for you through 2019? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you, Jeff. This is Rami. I'll start with your questions. And the first one on the cloud, clearly, the timing of project build outs have been difficult to predict. I just point out that it really is tied to a very few number of cloud providers, so you only have to get it wrong for a couple of customers to get it wrong all up. Having said all that, I still maintain that we have all of the ingredients in line to get this part of our business back to growth, from a technology standpoint, talent standpoint, the engagement at the engineer level within our organization that's all working very well. So I do think 2019 all up will be a growth year for us in the cloud based on the visibility that we have, the timing of deployments. To your question around the product set, all or most of the big product projects that we are or projects that we're working on right now that should see deployment in the coming quarters are PTX based. So I don't think that there is any difference based on what we've articulated in the past from a product standpoint. And tied to that is 400-gig. So very importantly, if you look at our cloud provider strategy all up, one element of the strategy is to ensure that we're doing everything that's necessary to maintain our footprint where we already have incumbency and of course that's a large footprint that exists among the major cloud providers.  And to return that part of the business to growth as the capacity requirements dictates or requires more networking capacity throughout their networks. But beyond that, there is a deliberate strategy to move into new footprint, especially closer to and into the data center with our switching portfolio. And honestly based on everything that we are working on from a software standpoint, from a silicon technology standpoint as well as the 400-gig roadmap, we have a lot of confidence that we can in fact expand our footprint. The last point I'll make around the cloud provider space, because I know it is top of mind for many of you is just that, we look closely at the health of the market from the standpoint of the health of our customers\u2019 businesses, right, the businesses of our cloud providers is thriving and we don't anticipate any major slowdown from that front and that should only maintain the requirement for them to invest in their network, so I remain optimistic about this part of our business in the future. Jeff Kvaal : It's a little difficult for us to square the growth in those businesses with your down cloud revenues, Rami and I think that's what has us scratching our heads a little. Rami Rahim : I totally understand that, but it's actually not that confusing when you think about it, because the major element of the revenue shortfall is the product transition. We\u2019re moving from a product that has a certain price per port to a different product that has a lower and substantially we\u2019ve been open with you about this, they\u2019re substantially lower price per port. We did this deliberately to avoid a scenario where we find that we will lose footprint, if we don't. So we are, in effect, disrupting ourselves to make it much more difficult for anybody else to come in and to disrupt us. So while, yes, it will be painful and dilutive to revenue in the short term, I think it's exactly the thing that we must do today to preserve that footprint and to get back to growth in the coming quarters. So I think that's the biggest element of the downturn in revenue that you're seeing today. Ken Miller : And the only thing I would add, this is Ken, is that our actual port count has grown here to date FY18 as compared to this point last year. So we are seeing growth and volume growth in port count and we're also seeing stabilization in pricing per port. So, as we continue to see growth, we will start to see revenue come back to growth as well as our expectation. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Two questions if I may quickly, Rami and Ken. The first is the delays in the cloud customers. How did that get you caught by surprise, because the delays or the slowdowns were generally known? And then the second part of the question is, the 5G cycle is starting to crank up here with Verizon in particular, when would you see kind of any order uptake in the routing business, as 5G broadband starts getting commercially deployed? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thank you, Vijay. Again, I want to sort of emphasize the fact that the timing of projects within the major cloud providers is really tied to a very few number of customers. And so if you get it wrong for just those customers, then obviously that puts challenges all up. Now, the guidance that we provided for Q4 is not that different than what it had was originally, so I don't think that there is a massive change in our outlook, relative to where we were just a quarter ago. And again, I want to emphasize the fact that I think we're doing everything necessary across the board to ensure that we are there to take advantage of the build outs when they occur and I do believe that they will occur based on our very tight engagement and conversations that we're having with our cloud customers. Second is your question about 5G. I'm very excited about the opportunity that 5G presents. I think the only question mark around 5G is really around the timing of those opportunities. Yes. I think you're starting to see some news and some very early deployments for 5G and in particular in the rand space, but we're gearing up across the board with our technology, so the MX5G capabilities that come in to the market in the Q1 timeframe with a feature set, it's really honed towards 5G option. Our partnerships with companies like Ericsson that I think helps us in relevance in penetration, in accounts where our customers are clearly thinking about their 5G roadmaps and then last but not least is the fact that most of the 5G deployments are really going to be cloud native in nature and we're seeing a really solid win rate right now in our telco cloud solution that includes Contrail as an SDN controller as well as the underlying switching, routing and security infrastructure to support that telco cloud architecture and this is being done -- basically rolled out by our customers in anticipation of 5G.  So we're not waiting until 5G becomes a big spend cycle before we start to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I know you said that the tariffs weren't expected to be -- to have too much of a material impact in the fourth quarter, but can you tell us -- can you help us understand what\u2019s the expected effect of the tariffs, assuming the step up to 25% in January. Ken Miller : Sure. So, this is Ken. So, clearly, we're watching it closely and we're not -- our position is not unique here. All of us are watching intently. Our strategy is to mitigate the impact of tariffs as much as we can. We have a global footprint. We do manufacture in multiple places, including China. There will be an impact. We were not able to mitigate and our current strategy is to pass an impact along to our customers and partners in the form of an import tax charge. Presuming we're successful in doing that would be largely profit neutral gross margin, sorry gross profit neutral, but it does have the potential to have a negative impact to gross margin as we move forward. Clearly, as we move to 25% or the potential to go to 25% would have a much more significant impact than the current tariffs. We're watching closely and we'll look to mitigate as we can going forward. Victor Chiu : Do you have a sense of how successful you may be in passing those or having customers absorb the increases? Ken Miller : Yeah. It's early days right now, but at this point, we feel pretty good about our position with the Q4 tariff in place and our ability to not only mitigate, but also pass along a relatively small increase to our customers. Victor Chiu : And given that this is an impact that\u2019s kind of across the board, are there competitive implications here for Juniper or. Ken Miller : We're watching the industry close. Clearly, in our case, it is important to note that all products are impacted, right. We do have many products that are not impacted. So mix is going to also matter as a result \u2013 as the impact of the tariff to the P&L, looking to optimize our footprint to put more in the non-tariff locations is something we're looking at very closely as well and we will continue to remain competitive in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Paul Silverstein : A couple of clarifications and a question. And the clarification is, Ken, I think I heard you say pretty clearly that pricing normalized on a year-over-year basis, on a like-for-like per port basis. I just want to confirm that. I recognize you had a big reset with the cloud situation, but is pricing now is ready to kind of normalize? And -- Ken Miller : Yes. I'll just jump in. Yes. That is correct. Paul Silverstein : And I assume, you're trying to exposure to just both direct and indirect with the indirect piece being by virtue of suppliers that it is just contract manufacturers or purchase components and their self-assemblies and I assume before we\u2019re going through that quantification, I'm hoping you give us some sense for what both the direct and the indirect exposure is and then the real question, from a competitive landscape standpoint, with the understand that revenues are backward looking, so I'm asking I'm looking out into the future, are you seeing any impact at this point from Cisco or Nokia, which both have introduced new platforms relatively recently, Arista, which has come in to the market as well with their own routing stacks, are you seeing them impact either your win rate in terms of new projects that haven't shown up in revenue yet and/or pricing. Rami Rahim : Let me take the competitive question. I -- honestly I haven't been this confident and optimistic about our technology roadmap ever at Juniper. If I look across the board from our switching portfolio, our routing portfolio and our security portfolio, I look at the underlying technology elements from a silicon development standpoint, our silicon photonics efforts, our operating system developments that we are making on, on an ongoing basis. And then the systems that we're introducing into the market just over the next year that are going to be 400-gig capable that are going to have operating system capabilities that are absolutely aligned with the direction of the market, I think we are going to be extremely competitive and I think we're also adding to that new layers of innovation in particular around the enterprise where our Contrail Enterprise Multicloud solution is really resonating with many of our enterprise customers that are looking to move to Multicloud solutions that I think is giving us a real leg up right now in the marketplace. So if anything, my expectation is that as we continue to introduce these systems, the software capabilities, our win rate will only increase going into next year. Paul Silverstein : Rami, do you think you can convert, there's obviously been secular issues on top of the competitive landscape in these service provider routing markets, do you think that can return to growth, are you going to have the benefit of using comps that are getting into, again, I understand there are secular challenges, but is it your internal expectation that that will return to growth or at least stabilize. Rami Rahim : So, in our November Analyst Day, we'll provide you with a longer term outlook for our business across each of our key market verticals. In the SP space, what I'll tell you for now is we're not going to model into our outlook a return to growth next year. We're going to be prudent and careful in our expectation for this SP-based, primarily because of the secular issues that you're talking about.  Having said that, there are a number of opportunities that are out there, that we are out to capture. These are net new footprint type opportunity for us in the demand of telco cloud in preparation for 5G deployments. In the cable space, remote fi type architectural solutions, metro build outs in anticipation of increased capacity requirements for 5G deployments, all of these are examples of net new opportunities that we're going after. The last one I will mention that we're actually already seeing really meaningful progress in is in our smaller form factor MX solutions that 204 and the 10003 that are already bringing us into footprints and new tier 2 type service providers that we never had a shot at in the past. So, there's a lot from a opportunity standpoint that I'm optimistic about, but I'm -- I also just want to be cautious because of the all up secular issues in our outlook for next year. Ken Miller : Yeah. And on the tariff front, I'm not going to break out the direct versus indirect. I will tell you that the majority of our exposure is on the direct side. Just to give you some numbers, I mean, for the balance of this year, we expect the import tax charge to be 3.5% of the net invoice for those impacted skews. So again not all skews are impacted, but for those impacted skews selling into the US from China, there will be an uplift on invoice of 3.5%. At that level, it should have a negative impact to gross margin of about 20 to 30 basis points, but it should be relatively profit neutral and clearly the exposure would go up, if the tariff did increase next year. Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : Let's talk about some of the things that work like enterprise and security. Maybe you could talk about, Rami, about the pipeline activity. I guess the one thing that people will be concerned about that is finally the time when cloud recovers, those things start slowing down. So help me think about the business momentum that you have there, how does the pipeline look like and how do you separate just the general strong spending environment from your performance, how do you tell how much of it is just all lifted versus you're delivering something that others do not. Rami Rahim : So I'm honestly very pleased with our performance in the enterprise space all up and in security. There is definitely a robust spending environment in the enterprise globally that we're taking advantage of, but we're now seeing seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the enterprise, the last quarter in Q3, 15% year-over-year. So I think that this is a emotion that's really working for us, a focus area that I'm quite optimistic about. To double click on it, we're seeing strength in customers that truly value and view their networks as mission critical to their businesses. So in the federal space, financial services, large banks, the momentum there is very strong. We're delivering solutions that are very meaningful for the direction of travel of many of the CIOs within those customers. Everybody today is thinking about how to move a Multicloud architecture. Few have the tools and the capabilities to do it. So in our view, this is an unsolved problem that is ripe for us to jump in and to help them solve it and our enterprise Multicloud solutions are doing just that. We have gotten third party validation from analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester recently about our data center networking technology and software defined networking capabilities that our enterprise customers pay very close attention to. And then of course, there is the sales motion. There is some solid sales execution that is happening in the enterprise due to a focus on going after net new logos and I expect that to only improve with the sales leadership changes that we have made in the company, primarily with the welcoming of Pierre-Paul to the company. So when I \u2013 and may be the last point on the enterprise, the enterprise routing, it's not just about switching and security, enterprise routing with our newer products or newer innovations like the 204 to 10003 are really working for us and enabling us to capture new footprint that we have not done in the past. So I expect that momentum to continue because bookings are solid, the engagement level is great and the execution all up I believe will only improve from here. Now going into security, in the security space, we had mentioned in last quarter that we had refreshed practically our entire product line with the exception of the high end, which was due for a refresh and that refresh happened in the Q3 timeframe with the third generation of our SBC line card for our high end firewall and as expected, the uptake and the pipeline built immediately again in a number of different customer verticals, in particular, in the banking sector, where that kind of security performance is just mandatory and honestly, they can't get from anybody else out there. And so we benefited from that in Q3, not just from a revenue standpoint, but from a booking standpoint, which will help us in future quarters. So both from an enterprise and security standpoint, I'm quite optimistic looking forward. Ken Miller : Yeah. The only thing I would add is just the breadth of the string. So for security, it was -- all verticals were up, both service provider cloud and enterprise. For enterprise, all technologies were up, routing, switching and security, so that breadth is very encouraging. I would also add that for both enterprise and security, our number of million dollar customers were up in the quarter. So we\u2019re seeing it kind of a broad based growth across the board for those two parts of our business. Operator : Our next question is form Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani : Hi. I'm trying to go back to the cloud question, and I'm trying to understand two things. First going into this quarter, we started hearing that few big cloud vendors, hyperscalers are reducing spending, because they started the year very, very strong with spending, and it's concentrated, but if you aggregate the numbers are so big, if you aggregate, you still see a decline in second half versus first half. So that's one driver, which is weak spending possibly. The second driver is that you've been working on architectural changes at some of your biggest customers, and the PTX was entering this quarter, the migration was 80% done, you said it in the past. And also at the switching level, the migration was happening, and I'm trying to understand what's the source for the weakness in cloud, is it because there is no spending and there is pressure on spending by cloud vendors, or is it because some of the components of your technology changes, some of this is not working according to the timetable that we expected or so is it technology or is it spending? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Tal. So I'll answer it in reverse order. I don't think it's a technology issue. The PTX, the product that we build, the technology, the feature capabilities were all developed exactly to capture the future cloud opportunity and our view has not changed at all in terms of the strength of that platform for those use case and those deployments. From a spending standpoint, I mean, we look at the same CapEx reports for the cloud providers that you do and obviously these are all encompassing CapEx reports that capture all of their investments across many different technology areas. And yes, there could be shifts and priorities for some of the largest cloud providers in terms of where they're going to be focusing their investment in different layers of the network or between different areas of IT that can impact the timing of deployments, and I suspect that is a function of what we're seeing out in the market. This is why, I don't just look at the CapEx reports, I also look at just the overall health of their own businesses, and I mean they're going to report soon. I don't expect any major slowdown. I expect that they are going to see robust business growth for them, and that is going to translate into a need to continue to invest into their networking infrastructure. We obviously can't predict the timing of build outs perfectly. Sometimes, they themselves can't predict their own timing, which makes it especially challenging for us. But what we can do is control everything that we can control in order to ensure that we capture the uptick in spending when it actually happen and there is the technology element to that, the talent element to that and the engagement element to that, that I've already talked to. Tal Liani : If I measure your performance in terms of units, ports and I apologize, I missed the first two questions. So maybe you answered this, but if I measure your performance with cloud in different ways, not in dollars, but rather ports, units, any other way. Will you have the same answer and I'm asking the question just because there is a pricing difference between PTX and MX and per ports. I'm trying to understand if what we're seeing is more of a pricing transition or what we're seeing is really overall kind of big picture spending pressure? Rami Rahim : I would say that the port or the number of ports or this volume of capacity that we have shipped into the cloud vertical this year has already far exceeded what it was year-to-date last year. So, I mean and port spending and consumption will fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, so it's actually more instructive to look at this on a yearly basis, but what we're seeing is, it's much more a function of price per port at least as it pertains to Juniper and our own projects, then it is volume of ports that we're actually shipping to the cloud providers. And again this since it's actually a good question that you're asking here. At the November analyst day conference, I think we can provide you with some more data that would give you the, what you're looking for in terms of actual port and capacity introduction into their networks. Operator : Our next question is from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I\u2019m on for John Roy. Following on from the previous question, I was wondering how 100-gig pricing for routing was in the quarter. You had indicated stability in the prior quarter. Is that still the case? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Our pricing has been very consistent from a like to like perspective, whether it be 100-gig to 100-gig or PTX to PTX. So we are seeing that normalize within the cloud routing as well as the SP routing. In fact, from a cloud all up routing perspective, we saw the ASP go up per port because we didn't see as much PTX mix as we expected to see as we enter the quarter, but on a like-for-like, it was very, very stable. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. And a long-term question as a follow-up, you've made a number of announcements around network automation and Contrail in recent months. Is there a way of thinking about how much incremental TAM this brings to Juniper and perhaps the industry? Rami Rahim : Yeah, it's a good question. In some sense, it does introduce new TAM because there is in fact a certain amount of spend that goes into automation and orchestration across a number of different use cases, whether it be in telco cloud or in multi-cloud for the enterprises and so on. It's a TAM that\u2019s measured in billions, it's something that we can\u2019t provide you with some more specifics around. It's not a small TAM, but that's only part of the strategy. Capturing that software investment as net new revenue for Juniper is something that we, of course, intend to do, but what we're also seeing, which is equally important to us is the fact that the software, the automation capabilities that we're introducing into the market are giving us an ability to sell holistic solutions. So for a Tier 1 telecom operator in Europe, we are essentially providing a complete stack from the server compute storage up through orchestration and VNF, the Virtual Network Functions, all up as a solution. There is the software and the hardware element to that sale. Increasingly in the enterprise space, as we're selling Contrail, whether it's immediate or eventually over time, Contrail Enterprise Multicloud becomes a strategic control point that allows us to sell additional infrastructure like switching and like security and like routing in time and we're already seeing that play out. Contrail Enterprise Multicloud has only been shipping now for a few weeks. We already have our first few wins that validate that solution sales thesis that I just described and this is why we are so optimistic about these capabilities that we're introducing to the market. Operator : Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on the cloud deals very quickly and regarding them getting pushed out. I wanted to get more color on what type of cloud deals these actually are and more specifically, are these the very major 100 megawatt datacenter facilities that our cloud providers building or are they more Metro dense sites that aggregate significant traffic on the routing level. I just want to get an understanding on where exactly in the cloud supply chain this stall and deployments is occurring? Rami Rahim : It's most -- the way I would characterize it is, it is the pace at which deployments are happening. And this is -- this touches the footprint that we have already deployed across the cloud space, which is in the wide area. So, data center interconnect backbone, it's -- these are real routing footprints that carry large volumes of traffic between data centers and connect the data centers to peering points that varies from cloud provider to cloud provider, but generally speaking, we're talking about wide area connectivity. Sami Badri : And then those are predominantly PTX deployments not MX or historically MX was used, but now moving forward, using mainly PTX? Rami Rahim : That is the nature of the transition. Yes. So historically, they've primarily been MX-based and going forward, they will mostly be PTX based. There will still be even within the cloud vertical, some use cases that rely on the programmability, the sophisticated feature set of the MX, but most of the major projects and certainly the projects that we're monitoring closely in terms of pace of deployments is -- are all around PTX. Sami Badri : And the second question I had was more of a big picture regarding 5G, based on your conversations with customers or the expectations of demand for 5G deployments, which products do you see customers deploying first from your suite of systems? And are there products that may they may potentially move away from, given the type of infrastructure they're looking to scale up as 5G ramps? Rami Rahim : Yeah. It's another good question. It really depends a lot on use case and we view it as follows. There is a very big telco cloud solution that involves our switching technology as well as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and our own network functions like security network functions as well as third-party network functions that all stitched together in preparation for 5G. In the backbone, it's a combination of MX and PTX. In the Metro, it's mostly MX and ACX. And so the product that will depend very much on the particular use case that you are talking about. I will also just mention here that we're working very closely with our partners to capture the 5G opportunity. Ericsson being a partnership that is long standing, but certainly one that we've only increased the strategic nature of recently and there are a number of solutions, yet to be announced externally that we're working on in concert with Ericsson to I think give us both an additional sort of means of competing in the 5G opportunity. So just stay tuned for that. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with digging into the gross margin performance in the quarter a bit. You saw strong improvements in the gross margin on both products and services sequentially, even when like product revenues were sequentially lower. So just wanted to understand if there were any cost actions that you started off in 3Q itself outside of normal seasonality, what the other things that help gross margin here. And I think if I can ask more kind of 4Q and then beyond are there cost actions on the core business that you can take to improve gross margins? Rami Rahim : Yes. So we're very pleased with our gross margin results in Q3 being above the range that we set in the beginning of the quarter. Clearly, we continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin, including innovation and design for value efforts as well as cost optimization within supply chain and customer service. Customer service, actually, the majority of the increase that they saw was not only a better volume from a sequential basis, but also good cost controls on the service delivery costs. So, that was really more of a cost controls perspective on the services gross margin uplift. On the product side, really the biggest driver was product mix as well as a little bit of geographic mix, but within product mix, we did see sequential growth in service provider and in routing all up and that's our highest margin product and within routing, even seen more mix of MX as compared to PTX was also a bit of a tailwind for our overall margin. So, those kind of product mix phenomenons that we saw in Q3, I do not expect to have similar mix in Q4. So when I guided Q4 at 60%, very much in line with our expectation and very much in line with our expectation that it would grow sequentially throughout the year. It is still down sequentially due to those mix impacts, not necessarily being as favorable in Q4 as we saw in Q3. Samik Chatterjee : And if I can just follow up with one on the tariff impact. You mentioned that once you kind of take pricing, you might see some customer buying behavior changes. When you look at Europe customer segments, enterprises, service providers, customers, where do you see the most sensitivity to kind of pricing actions, if you take any pricing, where do you think you'll see kind of the most impact when it comes to buying behavior? Rami Rahim : Yeah, I mean, difficult to predict at this point. At this point, I don't expect a material change in behavior. But it is a risk worth calling out. I think many customers are evaluating their own strategies within the tariffs and what is going to be monitoring and at this point, I don't expect it to be to impact our guide. However, it's just in a new risk I wanted to call out on the call. Operator : Our next question is form Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Rod. I have two questions. The first one I really wanted to just check in on the EMEA strength that you've been posting. Clearly, your EMEA business throughout 2018 has been better than at least the last couple of years. Wondering what's driving that strength, is it market share gains, is it service providers or enterprise traction, if you could quantify, that would be very helpful. Rami Rahim : I'd be happy to. So very proud of the EMEA team for delivery and consistently throughout the year across the board really. So the strength is pretty broad-based across all technologies, routing, switching and security as well as in the service provider and we had pretty substantial momentum in the enterprise space as well. I think that the EMEA team under relatively new sales leadership has been executing well. I think that the solutions that we have developed, both for the telcos, in particular, what we have real strength in tier 1 telcos have resonated with many of our customers there that are looking for partners in making this cloud transition. And then in the enterprise space, I think there, our cloud delivered enterprise strategy where we're delivering value through a cloud delivered motion like SD-WAN being an example of that is resonating well with our customers over there as well. And from a momentum standpoint, I'm pretty optimistic that it can continue. Unidentified Analyst : And just a quick one on switching as well. I think the performance in that business for the last three quarters or call it four quarters has been a little bit disappointing relative to consensus expectations. And if you look at the numbers that the street is modeling, the expectation for 2019 is a mid-single digit growth, while I recognize you won't be commenting on how much growth you expect, maybe would you care to elaborate on what would need to work for you for you to be able to get to that sort of growth or perform better than that. Rami Rahim : Yeah. So let me say, I am disappointed in our performance in switching for Q3. I think that we can and we'll do better. And let me just double click on the switching business a bit for you to explain where the weakness was, but also where there is a strength and momentum that might not be evident by looking at the, the All Up number. First, there is an element of our switching business that is very much tied to the cloud architectural transitions in our large hyper scalers that has had an impact and continues to have an impact as we work through the timing of new deployments within the large hyper scale data centers or large hyper scale opportunities that are out there. Second, we had some specific weakness in Asia Pacific in switching mostly as a result of sort of difficult compares and timing of opportunities. But if I put those two factors aside, what I like about our switching business is first momentum in the enterprise, both in the data center and also in the campus and we've introduced new capabilities, new products like multi-rate capabilities in our switching portfolio that is gaining some real potential, real momentum and building pipeline for the enterprise in particular. Second, we're seeing solid telco growth with our switching portfolio, primarily driven by telco data center and telco cloud build outs that I've already talked about. Third 100-gig adoption in our switching portfolio is working quite well for us. So the pace of 100-gig growth or 100-gig capable product is actually growing far faster than the overall switching number is growing. And then last but not least, a big part of the very healthy all up software business that we posted for Q3 is a result of selling software capabilities, along with our switching portfolio. So I think these underlying elements of the business give me confidence that once we address the hyper scale architectural transition and of course we continue the momentum we're seeing in the rest of the switching business, we can get this business to growth next year. Ken Miller : Yeah. And we will update our long-term model at the upcoming Investor Day on November 9 and we're not going to get into specifics of 2019 right now, but I will say overall, we expect revenues to be up in 2018. As Rami mentioned, the architectural shift in the cloud should largely be behind us and we expect the cloud vertical to be a growth year in 2019. And we see continued strength in enterprise. We believe those factors have more than offset potential weakness in the service provider space. In addition to the top line growth, we are expecting profits and operating margins to expand in FY19 as well, but again, more details to come in our upcoming Investor Day. Operator : And our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back on the MX and PTX router transition and maybe take a little bit differently in your service provider vertical. Can you just remind us again of what keeps that vertical from seeing a similar transition from MX to PTX longer term and how would you characterize the competitive landscape as you move towards the new Penta Silicon relative to what would be probably new platforms based on Jericho2, as we start to look into 2019 and I have a quick follow-up. Rami Rahim : Certainly. So it's having understanding of how the ratio of MX to PTX looks like between the different verticals, really comes down to understanding the use cases. In the cloud space, in particular in the hyper-scale cloud, most of the use cases are about high-performance connectivity. The value is primarily delivered from the data center, right, software that's running in the datacenter. And so what the cloud providers value our cost optimization, programmability, telemetry capabilities, the ability to host their own applications on the systems for certain elements of control that they really need in their networks, whether that be in the data center or in the wide area and all of these factors point towards the PTX. And that's why the transition has happened so rapidly. In the telco space, as I've mentioned, the ratio of MX to PTX has largely been unchanged. I do expect that the PTX will pick up more dedicated, very optimized core use cases in time, but it will be a slow and sort of moderate transition. The main reason is that in the telco space, many of the services that are being offered by telecom operators have embedded in the networks themselves and have a degree of requirement sophistication, the only products like the MX can in fact offer. And you've mentioned the roadmap with the Penta Silicon. What we do is, even if our customers start to think about what it is that they need to deploy in order to satisfy their use cases, we're always innovating with new generations in the MX that are improving the capacity, the performance and improving the cost efficiency of that platform substantially that makes it so that, it's just not worth in many use cases to look at alternative platform. That Penta silicon gives us a 300% improvement in performance at half of the power consumption with all of the programmability capabilities that our customers love, built in encryption and a whole host of other capabilities that just our customers truly love. The last question, I think, since you've mentioned Jericho, the MX is really in a class of its own when it comes to the inherent programmability and flexibility of that platform. The Jericho platform, Jericho based platforms are more competitive with PTX type systems out there and that's the comparison that I would make, the MX really from a silicon and the software standpoint is not one that one could easily, in any way build using merchant silicon at least for the time being. Operator : Our final question is from Jamie Fish from Piper Jaffray. Jamie Fish : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Actually, most of my questions have been answered and I won't ask the 10th question on the cloud vertical for you. I guess just on the software side, I assume you're going to give more color around what you guys expect that to get longer term. But what were the one-time items this quarter again on the 10% and why should we now expect that 10% level to sort of be maintained, as we move forward as your attach rates of software seem to be doing fairly well. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks for the question, James. So the components of software are broken out as follows. There is the newer software capabilities that we would describe as off-box. Our orchestration, our management software currently are -- obviously our enterprise Multicloud solutions, our off box software capabilities that would fit into that bucket and that is a small, but growing element of the overall software business. What is a more meaningful component is our Junos capabilities, our network operating system capabilities, where we have been executing on a very deliberate strategy over the last several years to disaggregate our operating system capabilities and give our customers choice of how much flexibility they want to buy and that's really working for us because it allows us to be very competitive with the appropriate pricing for less sophisticated use cases, but then to monetize the solution better as they go into more sophisticated use cases where the full breadth of routing and MPLS capabilities are required. I would say that that is a big part of the performance that we saw in the Q3 timeframe. There is a third leg of the software store, which is really around the solutions that are going to be offered to the enterprise like SD-WAN and so on. There is still a very small element today, but I expect, based on the momentum we're seeing in the market, I mean you saw just recently our Vodafone SD-WAN announcement that this element will grow in time.  The reason why I wouldn't expect 10% on an ongoing basis is simply lumpiness, I mean, customers are going to buy the capabilities and the upgrades to existing deployed infrastructure based on the requirements and where I don't think it's reasonable to assume that every quarter going forward will be this level. However, I do think that this part of the business is working and over a longer term period, I do expect it to grow. Ken Miller : Yeah. And just to add to that, the on-box advanced Junos kind of features and functions are what we saw an uptick in, in Q3. While we have many different software models, the majority of our software today, particularly the on-box software is in perpetual model. So when those orders come in, which we saw a fair amount of those in Q3, they show up as a bit of a lumpy transition. As we move forward, we're working on different business models that would make that revenue more ratable, but at this point, some of that perpetual revenue was hitting Q3 and I don't expect that to be similar in the next couple of quarters. Jess Lubert : So that's all the time we have today. Thank you all for your questions and we look forward to hopefully seeing you at our November 9 Analyst Day in New York. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q4 '18 and fiscal '18 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We experienced mix results during the December quarter. Total revenue of 1,181 million was below the low end of our guidance as another quarter of strength in our enterprise business was more than offset by weaker than expected trends with our cloud and service provider customers. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 came in slightly above the midpoint of our forecast due to healthy gross margins, continued cost control and a lower tax rate. While we are disappointed by our Q4 sales, we are seeing success in several areas of our business that we expect to continue through the upcoming year and should help drive the business back to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019. We are particularly encouraged by the momentum. We are seeing in our enterprise business which grew 13% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year due to broad based strength across product and geographies. Given the breadth and the strength in our enterprise vertical, strong customer interest in new platforms such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and MX10003 along with the investment we are making in our enterprise go-to-market engine, we remain optimistic this business will continue to see healthy trend over the coming quarters and remain a growth driver for Juniper in 2019. I think it's also worth mentioning the success we are seeing in security, which grew 34% quarter over quarter and 18% year-over-year and surpassed a 100 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in several years. Our new product continued to resonate in the market and drive broad-based strength across a wide variety of customers. Our recently introduced high-end firewall line card saw particularly strong demand, which helped drive a high volume of deals greater than 1 million. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident that our security business will grow in 2019. We're continuing to see success in our software business which grew 32% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the fourth quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings with revenues from our Contrail family increasing more than 100% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and rising more than 200% for the full year 2018. While we do not expect our success to be linear, we believe software will continue to increase as a percentage of our revenue over time, especially as we introduce new products and new business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings over the next few quarters. Conversely, we continue to experience weakness within the cloud and service provider verticals. Our cloud business has remained challenged over the last few quarters as several of our hyperscale customers have continued to run their networks harder. While continued support growth is driving confident that we are holding our hyperscale footprint and the MX to PTX transition is now largely behind us. The pace of this port growth in the portion of our cloud customer's network where we have historically played is slower than we expected. Based on what we're hearing from our customers, we believe wins and new used cases will be needed to drive the cloud growth we guided for at our November, Analyst Day. We are laser focused on capturing these opportunities and view the 400 gig transition as an inflection point that will present the opportunities for us to take share starting later this year. Our current product roadmap and strong customer relationships are driving a high level of confidence in our ability to secure these net new used cases in the cloud particularly in the data center where we have relatively low presence today. While business model pressures and the impact of consolidation may continue to impact service provider spending for at least a few more quarters, with our MX 5G product refresh and Contrail Solutions to drive telco cloud transformation, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on carrier 5G deployment and remain optimistic regarding our partnership with Ericsson. We believe these products and partnerships should position us to deliver better service provider results later in the year. We remain confident in our strategy and that we are taking the necessary actions needed to win in the market as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud. We believe these transitions are likely to drive major technological change that will create significant opportunities to disrupt the status quo and take share. We intend to capitalize on these opportunities and while some of these changes may create disruptions in the near term, we believe they will play a critical role in returning the business to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019. Some of these actions we are taking are as follows. First, we have made significant changes to our go-to-market structure in order to better align our sales strategies to each of our core customer verticals. While many of these changes have been made over the last few months and may drive some near term disruption in our go to market engine, we believe more closely aligning our sales leadership and product management teams across our core vertical will result in greater accountability better products and a superior customer experience. We are also flattening our go to market organization and reallocating captured savings towards placing more product sharing sales reps into the field. We believe these actions will position us to see improved sales force productivity later this year. While our Chief Customer Officer left Juniper earlier this month, we are confident that the changes we have implemented are supportive of our strategy and should position Juniper to better capitalize on the market opportunities that will unfold over the next two years. Second, we are on the verge of introducing several new products over the next few quarters that we believe will further strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise market. By the end of this year, we expect that nearly all of our product lines will have undergone a major refresh that should enhance our position relative to key competitors. These anticipated offerings will include new MX line card that will strengthen our ability to capitalize on carrier 5G initiatives, new 400 gig platform that will improve our ability to capture data centric footprint particularly in the cloud and new enhancement to our Contrail Enterprise Multicloud platform that will help our mid to large enterprise customers transition to a multicloud world with increased simplicity and reduced cost. We also plan to introduce new silicon photonics capability that will further enhance our competitive positioning, and we plan to share more with you on this topic at the upcoming OFC Conference. We believe the 400 gig upgrade cycle, 5G deployment and enterprise multicloud initiatives each represents large opportunities where we are well-positioned to benefit over the next several years. Finally, we are taking actions to better monetize the value of our software which should help us capture more recurring revenue and build on the success we've experienced over the last few quarters. Going forward while we continue to sell hardware-based systems with a base level of software, we expect to increasingly look to monetize our more advanced software features through recurring licenses. We believe these efforts will not only prove beneficial for our customers but also create net new revenue for Juniper that will improve visibility, profitability and customer retention. We believe we have the right systems and sales strategies in place to drive this transition that should benefit our software sales over the next few years. While the changes we are making was held position Juniper to see sequential growth beyond the March quarter and a return to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019, some of these actions are likely to present near-term headwinds that we have factored into our Q1 outlook. We are also anticipating that the weakness we have been seeing in our cloud business continues through the March period. In addition, our Q1 forecast also factors in the potential to see below seasonal trends in our U.S. government business due to the recent shutdown of the U.S. Federal government which is historically accounted for about 15% of our enterprise revenue. Despite the potential to see near-term revenue headwinds, we remain focused on improving gross margin and optimizing our cost structure with the goal of positioning the business to see material earnings growth as the business recovers overtime. In summary while our business is lumpy and difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we continue to believe in the long-term financial model we presented at our recent Analyst Day and remain optimistic regarding our long-term prospects. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to our customers in which we believe should position the business to see improved long term success. As evidenced of the confidence we have in our business, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share and we expect to initiate an approximately $300 million accelerated share repurchase program. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper, I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more details. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start by discussing our fourth quarter results then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook. Fourth quarter revenue of 1,181 million was below our guidance range, primarily due to the slower than anticipated pace of deployments with some of our cloud and service provider customers. Despite lower revenue, non-GAAP gross margin of 60.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59 which was the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at revenue by vertical, Enterprise increased 14% year-over-year, driven by strength across all geographies and technologies. The 13% sequential increase enterprise was better than normal seasonality and slightly above our expectations. Service provider revenue declined 15% year-over-year, primarily due to the weakness in Americas, partially offset by strength in EMEA. Sequentially, service provider declined 5% primarily due to weakness in the Americas and APAC. Cloud revenues declined 8% year-over-year and sequentially due to the pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we are confident in our position with our strategic cloud customers and that we are holding our footprint. However, the pace of deployments is proceeding more slowly than we previously expected. From a technology perspective, routing and switching businesses both declined year-over-year. Routing declines were largely due to the pace of deployments and service provider, which was partially offset by strength in enterprise. On a sequential basis routing was down 10%, driven by service provider and to a lesser extent cloud, partially offset by an increase in enterprise. Switching declined 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which was partially offset by the strength in enterprise. The 3% sequential growth was driven by enterprise and service provider, partially offset by a decline in cloud. Security was up 34% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, security saw strength in enterprise. Sequentially growth was driven across all verticals. Our Services business declined 1% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, Services would have increased 4% year-over-year. We are pleased with the performance of our software offerings, which were greater than 10% of total revenue in Q4. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud, five were service providers and one was in enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $144 million, a decline versus prior year. However, without the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 6% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 60.9% stronger-than-expected non-GAAP gross margin was primarily due to the increased software revenue and strong service margin offset by mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $212 million. We paid $62 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share. Moving onto the results for the full year, fiscal 2018 was a challenging year with revenue declining 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share declining 11%. The Enterprise vertical was an area of strength where we saw sustaining momentum growing 10% for the year. Security was another highlight for 2018, growing year-over-year for five consecutive quarters and posting 14% growth for the full year. Looking at our other technologies, routing declined 16% versus 2017, due to the ongoing architectural transitions in cloud and a deceleration in our service provider business. Switching declined 3%, primarily due to the weakness in cloud, which was partially offset by enterprise. Our Services business remains strong with 5% growth normalized for the adoption of ASC 606. The strength in this business was primarily driven by strong renewal and the tax rates of support contracts. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, EMEA grew 8% while the Americas declined 14% and Asia-Pac declined 8%. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, fiber cloud four were service provider and one was an enterprise. Total non-GAAP gross margin of 59.9% was a decline of 2 points year-over-year. In 2018, we continue to focus on prudent and disciplined operating expense management, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense decline of 26 million or 1%. For the year, we had good cash flow from operations of $861 million. From the capital return perspective, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares and paid 249 million in dividends in 2018. Our total capital return for the year was nearly $1 billion and represented 140% of free cash flow. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q1 revenue outlook reflects continued weakness with our cloud customers. In addition, we are transitioning our go to market organization to enable our strategy. While we are confident these changes will lead to long-term growth, this may result in short-term challenges. We have also factored in the partial U.S. Federal government shutdown and geopolitical uncertainty which we believe could adversely impact our business in the early part of 2019. These factors lead us to expect below normal seasonality for the first quarter. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow on a sequential basis with better trends during the second half of the year. A return to year-over-year growth is expected at some point in the second half of the year. We remain confident in our long-term financial model we outlined at our Investor Day in November last year. Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected toward the low-end of our long-term model in the first quarter due to lower revenue volume, product mix and the impact of China tariffs. Full year non-GAAP gross margins are expected to improve directionally from Q1 '19 levels and we believe gross margin for the year will be toward the midpoint of our long-term model. Moving on to operating expenses, despite the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase of fringe costs in the first quarter we plan to manage our operating expenses prudently throughout the year. Based on our current forecast we expect operating expenses on a full year basis to be relatively flat versus 2018. For 2019, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be approximately flat versus 2018, plus or minus 1%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.85 for 2019. And finally, as Rami discussed previously, our Board of Directors have declared the increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share to be paid this quarter, to stockholders of record. This reflects an increase of approximately 6% compared to previous quarterly dividends. In addition, we plan to enter an accelerated share repurchase program of approximately $300 million. These activities reflect our confidence and the future prospects of the business. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : It sounds like you are pretty optimistic about the second half of 2019 and expect that you get to growth again. Just wondering if you could help us to understand or appreciate. What opportunities you see as really the key drivers just things I'm thinking of whether it's 400 gig or 5G opportunities or a snap back in the cloud demand? Could you maybe rank order what are the key drivers we should be paying attention to for that return to growth? Rami Rahim : I'll take that. So, there are few factors. First and foremost, as we mentioned within the cloud vertical, the MX to PTX transition is at this point largely behind us. And so while the pace of deployments in the cloud within the areas where we have strengths has been slower, we at least have reduced the impact of the product transition that was a big impact for us in 2018. Second, I would put the product roadmap. 2019 is a very big year for us from the standpoint of introducing new products across the board, especially in routing and switching. And yes, in particular for 400 gig but even in advance of 400 gig will be denser 100 gig products. Couple that with some of the optics innovations that we are going to be introducing to the market and we are going to have a very big year from the standpoint of just new innovation that we're putting into the market. Some of those happened this quarter, so our MX refresh, our MX5G refresh which gives us an opportunity to upgrade our very broad based MX product portfolio with tens of thousands of chassis, hundreds of thousands of empty slots worldwide, gives us an opportunity to start selling and seeing a meaningful revenue contribution in the second half. The third factor that I would add would be just the sales changes that we are making. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are making changes that are somewhat challenging in the short-term, but I have complete conviction are the right changes for the Company in the longer term, and I do believe that we will start to see the benefits of those changes in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s how I would that stack rank or at least provide a color on the factors that give us confidence in the second half. Simon Leopold : And Rami just to follow up on those comments. Is there any aspect of the weakness that you would attribute to the classic Osborne effect? Or are customers waiting for the new generation of products so buying fewer of the current offerings? Rami Rahim : Simon, it's always difficult to predict how much that is a factor, but I would say thus far that has not been a big contribution to the impact. I think it's mostly the general weakness within the service provider vertical and the slowing of deployments in areas where we have strength within the cloud vertical. And on the cloud, I would say that the opportunity is still very much there to take net new footprints and that's what we are absolutely focused on right now. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Two-part question quickly. 5G and the drumbeat is on, I mean, we recovered names like keys and others. So, would it be second half Rami? Or when would be the timeframe when Juniper's starting portfolio would start inserting itself into 5G broadband? And then the second part of the question is approximately, would second half also be the timeframe for any positive news on 400 gig cloud switching? Rami Rahim : Let me address those in order. So first 5G, 5G I think does represent a meaningful opportunity for Juniper to see not just a recovery in our routing business, but honestly it takes share opportunity for us. That said I think it's going to be slow and steady. We are going to be running our business assuming that the challenges within the service provider vertical persist, but we are going to be preparing ourselves to capitalize on 5G opportunities as they become increasingly meaningful to our business. And to be more specific, first you mentioned routing, yes, I mean routing is a big area of innovation for 5G because 5G promises to put lot more capacity in the networking demand and we are going to be prepared for that with our silicon and software roadmap to capture the opportunity. Secondarily security, you saw the strength that we experienced in our security vertical in our security technology in the Q4 timeframe. A big contributor that strength has been in our high end firewall technology that has seen its way into all the key segment but especially in service provider and especially to support mobile networks. And I think as the world moves to 5G the need to secure the infrastructure the data the users at scale without impacting performance only increases. And third is telco cloud. 5G is necessarily going to be a cloud needed technology. Many of the most strategic engagement that we have with our SP customers today are around the transition towards a telco cloud architecture. And I'm happy to report the win rate has been really, really encouraging. Across the globe we are now entering into more and more strategic build out of telco cloud opportunity that start with Contrail edge cloud as a software, but gives us the opportunity to up sell into switching routing security and our virtual services. It's not yet a meaningful revenue contributor, but I do think it starts to meaningfully contribute especially as 5G becomes more of a factor. On your question about 400 gig, I think the real revenue contribution for 400 gig will be next year in the 2020 timeframe, but the decisions or at least some of the decisions will start to be made third in the cloud space and then followed shortly by the service provider space. So I think we are going to be well prepared with really fantastic technology and there is right timing for that technology this year to capture that opportunity across our entire routing and switching footprint and product line. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Rami, I think you made it clear that it\u2019s a function of slowness and in demand in a part of carriers and the cloud. But I got to ask the question which is, is there any weakness due to competitive losses or due to place degradation and depending on connection with that slowness in demand? Rami Rahim : Thank you, Paul. Yes, another one. Paul Silverstein : Well, I do, but I'll let you respond to that. And then if I could, I have got quick clarifications of previous questions. Rami Rahim : Yes, sure, so look within the cloud vertical as I mentioned, the product transition is now largely behind us and is less and less of factor with every passing quarter. The new build outs are taking longer to happen slower than what we had originally anticipated, but importantly you have to recognize that the port growth is actually still growing and growing meaningfully. So based on that based on our very tight connection that we have with our cloud provider customers, I do not believe that we are losing footprint that is not the issue that is slowing us down here. It really is just a matter of our cloud provider customers now consuming the capacity that they have built into their networks, and yes, running them harder before they increase their buildup. The cloud CapEx opportunity all up for us I think remained healthy. What we need to do now is capture new footprint in particular as we get closer and closer to the data center where our penetration within the hyperscale cloud providers is still very low. We have done a great job of penetrating the smaller cloud providers and enterprises and switching we have not yet been able to penetrate the hyperscale switching environment and that\u2019s a big focus for us going forward. Ken Miller : Yes and just to add Paul, from an ASP perspective, we are seeing what I would refer to just kind of normal pricing decline on a per capacity basis. You know the big headwind of MX to PTX is behind as Rami mentioned are largely behind us. There is still going to traditional routing pricing erosion that we are still seeing. And what's happening in the port growth although it's up, it's not enough to offset that kind of normal price curve. So port growth is up and that will be expected it to be and therefore the math has yet to turn to our favor on a real cloud routing. Paul Silverstein : So just some very quick clarifications, so normal pricing of the extraordinary. Rami in response to the question of cloud, I hear your response on the service provider things, you're down 15% year-over-year. Is that just softness in spend or you also going to pick up to some extent? And then Rami just to be clear in your statement about new products, the '19 is a really big year. Was '18 a relatively light year on your new product intros? Rami Rahim : '19 relative to '18 is definitely a very different picture in terms of new product introductions. So '18, it was probably more of a normal year maybe a little bit light, '19 is a very different picture in terms of the sheer of volume of product we will be introducing into the markets. Just to give you an idea four new custom silicon engines being their way into very different routing and switching product lines as well as merchant silicon offerings for the switching environment as well. And not to mention across the board in terms of our automation telemetry orchestration management software that we are going to continue to see substantial enhancements throughout year. So 2019 is a very big year from a product standpoint. On the SP side, I think the market dynamics are just difficult within the service providers right now. As you know CapEx is sort of flattish, has been flattish for some period of time. I think many of the service providers are focusing on things like 5G ran on acquisition of content providers et cetera et cetera and we have to play that out. I do very much believe that we are maintaining the strong connections to our Tier 1 telco customer that we enjoy worldwide. And again in areas of future growth, especially in telco 5 transformation I think we are doing very well but just not enough to contribute and to offset the weakness in the more traditional areas. Ken Miller : Yes, we were expecting general pressure in service provider. We have experienced that for several quarters in a row. Down 15% year on year though that was not what we expected as we entered the quarter, nor do I think that\u2019s the new normal going forward, that's really just customer concentration and lumpiness of the business. It really does fluctuate quarter to quarter but that\u2019s not a trend that we expect persist going forward at that level. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : I have a question and a clarification. I think perhaps Rami my clarification is for you. I was wondering if you could help us eliminate what you meant when you said that the cloud target or targeted growth rates in cloud require some new wins for you to hit. And then my second question which is a bigger one is. The outlook that you shared with us at the Analyst Day in November I would guess didn't anticipate necessarily as week of the March quarter as what we were facing now. Could you talk us through about how things changed over the course of the second half of the quarter because it was quite a big shift? Rami Rahim : Let me start on the question about the cloud maybe, Ken, can address some of the questions about the outlook. So, the factors within the cloud vertical were one the product transition itself that we talked that linked about over a number of quarters now. And then last quarter we talked about some of the slowness that\u2019s happening within the card vertical and investment in areas where we have strength. Assuming that that slowness continues that the pace of investments in the WAN area, the routing areas of the cloud market in particular the hyperscale cloud market persist, then yes, I think we will need net new footprint in order to achieve the growth that we outlined in our long-term model that we provided in our November analyst event. If for any reason the pace that which they are investing in the routing area picks up then obviously that\u2019s lessens the requirements on obtaining net new footprints. Either way, we are absolutely focused from a technology, from an engagement from a software, a hardware standpoint on winning net new footprints, and I'm confident that we can. Ken Miller : Yes, on the revenue side as we mentioned on the remarks and in the commentary we do expect sequential growth from here. I also highlighted that I expect the second half to be a stronger trend in the first half. And we expect to return to growth at some point in the second half. That said the EPS guidance that I put out there of a $1.75 to $1.85 does not depend on full year revenue growth this year. We are still striving for full year revenue growth but our EPS model does not depend on that. From a Q1 specific what is kind of changed, I would say the two things that what's calling out are obviously the federal government shutdown as we mentioned earlier, the sales disruption. So based on visibilities that I see now for Q1, I believe the Q1 guidance is very appropriate. I do believe some of the sales force option has been factored into that visibility and that should improve throughout the year. And we are still committed to long-term model I think that\u2019s important to note. Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy : This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. I think I wanted to go back to the routing and pretty clearly the PTX discussion a little bit more. When we were looking at the PTX transition a year ago, you had been considering a large increase in PTX ports to offset the ASP declines. And clearly, that's not what's happening at this moment. So I wanted to check how confident you are that kind of port growth can still happen in 2019 versus potential for any kind of displacement are share losses that you may have there? And then I have a quick follow-up. Rami Rahim : So I have utmost confidence that the PTX product line is the right product line, especially for cloud routing buildups. And as I mentioned, the transition from MX to PTX happened for a reason and that is that the PTX was extremely well received by our largest hyperscale cloud providers. And I do think, it's actually a unique platform in the industry in terms of robustness, physical scale, logical scale, programmability. All the things that are cloud customers truly care about. And the port growth within the PTX product line has actually been quite healthy. The factor that is impacting us today is simply the pace of which these build outs would with the PGF are happening they are slower than what we had anticipated and so even with more normalized pricing declines on a year-over-year basis it just has not been enough to get us to growth. That's essentially what's happening with the product in that transition. But again, I just want to emphasize, I think the PTX is a wonderful product and it's extremely well receive by all of our cloud customers. Balaji Krishnamurthy : And then on the go-to-market transition that you announced, could you just walk us through a little bit of the thinking there to how you got and came to the conclusion that it is the gap in the go-to-market approach that you need to change versus any kind of technological or partnerships that you may need otherwise? Rami Rahim : Certainly, so, first the changes that we've made in go-to-market are changes that we have been thinking about now for several months and we've now put into effect. The first of which is around having a more of its segments based model in go-to-market while we protect resources and we create more focused on success in each of our key verticals HP cloud and enterprise. But additionally, we've made some really tough decisions, but I think the right decisions and addressing benefit tool and minimizing the layers of the organization in making the overall go-to-market organization much more efficient. And even while preserving the investments in the quarter market our organizations, we have now increased the number of quota-carrying sales reps that will help us, especially in continuing the momentum or even accelerating the momentum that we've enjoyed in the enterprise vertical. None of these changes are easy, but I have utmost conviction that they are the right ones for the Company and they are going to pay off for us later this year. And I should just point out that Ken and I and Jeff are actually in Las Vegas right now at our global sales kickoff, where we have the opportunity to engage with our global sales and support organization. And I think people are feeling very good about the changes, even though they are disruptive and can be little unsettling in the short-term. There is general consensus they are absolutely the right changes for the Company and people are quite optimistic that we can leverage these changes to achieve success and win. Operator : Our next question is from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh : A couple of vendors this earnings season have alluded to cloud demand being weaker. So, it's true as how much visibility do you have into when cloud demand might get better? Rami Rahim : We're not calling that right now. We are essentially seeing the slowdown in the routing market where we have the strength. But I do want to emphasize, when I look at the overall cloud opportunity. And yet we have real strength in the wider area in routing and DCI, data center interconnect, we have an incredible opportunity to move into net new footprint. And again, when we have a CTO, Bikash Koley that comes from that world that has been shaping our product strategy and our engagement strategy to attach towards that opportunity especially a 400 gig becomes a real momentum driver later this year. I think our ability to capture more of that share in the broader cloud opportunity is absolutely there. Tejas Venkatesh : And as a follow-up, any chance you will parse the delta in 1Q guidance versus expectations? Essentially, I'm wondering how much of that delta is from weaker cloud versus weaker federal versus all the go-to-market changes? Ken Miller : Yes, so I won't give you exact numbers, but I will tell you kind of the order of magnitude I would put, I would put cloud first and you think of that is kind of continuation of our Q4 results. So I think sequential is Q4 to Q1 are down primarily because of our actions in Q4, largely cloud deployment base and some service providers as well that would be number one. The second one I would argue with sales force disruption and then the third factor would be U.S. government shutdown. Although, they are obviously our largest enterprise customer, I don't -- I would rank them third, and we are trying to bridge that 100 million delta. Operator : Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : I have a two-part question. So result from strength in the security and services segment and just two parts to this. The services revenue as a percentage of product revenue intensified to a pretty higher rate over 50% in 4Q 2018. What exactly is driving this? And then the second part is, on security you clearly have hit a new run rate of 100 million in the quarter. Should we expect this going forward through 2019 for each quarter? Or is this one-off in 4Q '18? Rami Rahim : Let me start with the security question and then, Ken, why don\u2019t you address the services piece. So first I have to say that I'm very pleased with the momentum that we've now seen in security for a number of quarters in the Q4 timeframe growing 34% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. What I like about the security number that we posted is broad-based momentum across cloud providers, service providers and enterprises. We saw strong demand across the different lines of products in high end to mid range and in the branch. And the diversity of used cases and just number of net new million dollar deals all point to the fact that I think we can see continued momentum in security. Will every quarter be as strong this quarter? I think that\u2019s an unrealistic expectation. So I think you are going to have some lumpiness and some moderation especially as now the comps become more difficult. But generally speaking, I think that we have cracked the recipe for success in security in terms of the strength of product portfolio, but even more importantly in attaching security to our overall solution offering. So when we go to our customers and offer them a cloud data center solution, we know how to integrate security in that overall offering and I think that has worked quite well for us. Ken? Ken Miller : And from a services perspective, it was really due to the strength of our attaching renewal rates and I would call out that majority of our services revenue is actually in that renewal category. It is product we sold over the last several years and we continue to service contracts. So, the correlation between current quarter product revenue and service revenue is really not that strong at all. The majority of the service revenue is prior period product sales and we continue to enjoy good renewal rates if we hold that revenue stream for us. I would add although it's still relatively small. We have seen a growth in our professional services business as well. And we obviously had a pretty strong quarter in Q4 in professional services. Sami Badri : And I just have one other question regarding Asia and EMEA. In Asia and EMEA we have seen clear indicators from Huawei and CTA and they are being replaced by alternative vendors across the equipment stack and we saw some of the industry data in 3Q 2018 point to this. Can you just give us an idea on Juniper's win rate for some of these open market share opportunities given that you are seeing U.S. vendors starting to win in those opportunities? Rami Rahim : Yes, I think it's still too early to call any sort of the benefit from the new cycle and the concern around Huawei technology. However, having said that, I mean Juniper is a company that takes the security and the safety of our product extremely seriously and to the extent to more and more of our customers internationally put focus on these types of concerns and I do think it could present an opportunity that we will be capitalizing on. But at this point and were still competing on the merits of our technology. Operator : Our next question is from George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead. George Notter : I guess I wanted to ask about the mix of port shipments into the cloud providers. On the rounding side I think in the past, you talked about 80% being PTX versus MX. I guess I'm wondering what that percentage is now? And then also I just want to go back to the question of routing market share among cloud provider customers and I heard what you said about port growth coming out of those customers, but at the same time, those customers have been growing at tremendous rates and it's particularly if you look at their businesses from a revenue perspective. You're talking about them running their networks hotter. I guess I'm trying to understand where you're getting that point of view. Is that something that's coming in anecdotally? Or is just simply an observation based on ordering transiting in new business? Anymore flavor you could add around the demand trends there would be great in the market share? Ken Miller : I'll start with port count and then Rami can go on the last question. So from four comp perspective, as we've been saying, there is like the MX to PTX largely behind as Q4 was another quarter of roughly 80%, 20%. So 80% of the products ports sold in Q4 where PTX ports 20% MX products. I do expect that percentage to still get move slightly up from 80%, but again it's low to the high end at this point and that's it's not going to go to zero. So we're finally settled to 8,515 maybe 9,010 part of the delta at this point but were mostly there at this time. Rami Rahim : And I think, George, the part of your question is really around. Are we seeing competitive displacement? Or is it really just consumption of capacity that we're selling into the areas of the network within the cloud base that is that has traditionally been very strong for us? And I can tell you just based on all the information we have the engagements what we have this is not a matter of competitive displacement. We are as you might imagine working very closely with our key hyperscale customers in their network buildout and particular in the routing domains and the wider year domain. And we are fulfilling their capacitor requirements and we see this and based on that engagement, but also based on the port growth that we are seeing and what we are selling. It's just a matter of the more normalized pricing compression that we're now seeing on a year-over-year basis, has not yet sort of outpace if there is by the it's not yet outpace by the increase in capacity. As that plays out if the pace accelerate so I think we benefit from that and we do have an opportunity to capture net new footprints opening routing areas where we don't yet have presence as well as especially internationally, as well as in the switching domain. Operator : Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, James, maybe mute by accident. And we will go to the next question here from Ryan McGregor from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Q - : This is Ryan on behalf of Steve Milunovich, just a quick question for me. Going back to EMEA, the region continues to show strong growth. Could you guys talk about what's driving that and what might be working in that that maybe could translate back to APAC or the Americas? Rami Rahim : Certainly, yes, so we are pleased with our momentum in the EMEA region growing 6% year-over-year. It's actually broad based so the strength is across enterprise and service providers cloud as well as cloud is less of a factor in the EMEA region. It's also we are seeing strength across all technologies areas routing and switching. I think it really comes down to strong sales execution in that region. In fact, our new sales leader, Marcus Jewell, for a global sales organization was running in the EMEA region until he was promoted to that role. And I do think that one thing that we have done very effectively in the EMEA region is to sale the broad strength of our solutions. So when I talk about our telco cloud transformation or Contrail Enterprise Multicloud to help in multicloud connectivity for the enterprise domain, EMEA has led the way and demonstrating what's possible by up selling into these solutions, and I think they have benefited from that. The key now, especially with some of these go to market changes that we have put in place is to replicate that model that has proven itself to be successful need in that region across the world. Ryan McGregor : And then just one follow-up in terms of software revenue as a percent of total revenue, so it's been about 10% for two quarters in a row now. Last quarter when it was about 10 you guys guided down, saying it probably would maintain that level, but it's about 10 again, but you are guiding down again. So just curious what your thought process is around that? Rami Rahim : Yes, so last quarter was approximately 10 this quarter actually crossed 10 for the first time. And based on the deals that we see and visibility we have, I do think it's going to modulate plus or minus a bit off of that category. I'm not expecting a material drop down to something 7 to 5 or anything that nature, but I do think 10% that we crossed in Q4 is not repeatable in the first half of next year. But directionally over the next several years, I'm quite confident that software as a percent for total revenue will only go up and exactly put a long-term model out there of greater than 15% by 2021. So, we are well on track to achieve that on a full year basis quarter getting fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter. Ken Miller : And just some additional commentary on that, this is a matter of strategy. We have been really focused on increasing our software as a percentage of total product revenue in total revenue. We have now implemented a pricing model and a business model first to offer across all of our product lines that have been well received by our customers. We are introducing new software capabilities software products into the markets, especially our Contrail suite of products that has been very well received by our customers and we are seeing the momentum there. So, I do think that over time on a long-term basis, we are going to see software become much more meaningful. I think that\u2019s good for our customers. I think that\u2019s good for Juniper. So even if it fluctuates, I think thus far we are very pleased with the results that we've been able to achieve. Jess Lubert : Operator, we have time for two more questions. Operator : Our next question here is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. James Fish : Just wanted to touch base on the security side of things, good quarter there kind of going off to another question with the strong growth, and Rami you are saying that you don't think it's sustainable. I guess how should we think about the competitive nature for the high end firewall refresh especially as you've had a competitor now come out with a targeted service fiber firewall? Rami Rahim : Look, the security market has always been extremely competitive and I think the recipe for us was to come-up with a technological advantage but and also a solution and the go-to-market advantage. From a technology standpoint one of things that I think we've always done better than anybody else is, the combination of richness of the features coupled with scale and performance and then we've seen that in the high-end firewall and I think that has work for us. Honestly one of the reasons why we saw some weakness in security prior to a year-ago was because it took us a little too long to do that high-end refresh. As soon as we determined that this was necessary we really started to spread up but as soon as we introduce that we have confidence that it would work for us we knew there would be differentiated and it's doing exactly that is working very effectively for us. Additionally, now as I mentioned earlier, we have integrated security into all of our solution offering so as we think about multi-cloud solutions that help our customers to manage distributed assets across private and public cloud. We've now worked security into that broad offering and it's become a real compelling reason for our customers and to purchase securities for us. So across the board I think we found the recipe and it is working well. Yes, I mean 18% double-digit growth on a sustained basis, I don't -- I do not think is a practical thing to assume. But I do think that continued momentum in the cards yet. James Fish : And then just two quick housekeeping items, you guys kind of started breaking out Contrails and software in terms of growth, I guess, how big is Contrails now within the software business today? And then secondly, did you guys give a weight Q4 from the tariffs on in terms of lift on revenue, and if so can you quantify it? Rami Rahim : Yes, so Contrail is relatively small. We're not going breakout the total dollars. I would say that the primary value that as we've been talking about for quite some time is not just the monetization of Contrail, but the actual discussion around the customers and architectures that were promoting with Contrail and the strategic nature of the sale. So, we're not going to breakout the numbers, but it is growing by itself, but it's actually alignment to win large opportunities in both service provider and enterprise and that's really a biggest impact to our numbers. On a tariff perspective, I will say from a gross margin perspective, it had about a 30 basis point impact to the Q4 gross margin. I've also factored a similar level into the Q1 gross margin. From a revenue perspective, again, it's difficult to quantify whether any pool ends because of potentially concerns of higher tariffs. I do not believe we have a material revenue change because of tariff. I think it was pretty much normal course and speed in Q4. At this point, I'm expecting similar in Q1. I'm not expecting anything impact of tariffs on the top line. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Samik. So just two questions, one was about the award win in Japan with broadband tower. Just curious on what drove the customer's decision to chose Juniper. And were there other competitors considered? And then I have a quick follow up after that. Rami Rahim : Yes, so we are very pleased with that award. I think it's just one of many that we would see with net new logos in the quarter. I believe that was more of a routing opportunity but one that we are very proud of. Beyond that I think as we highlighted in the press release. Unidentified Analyst : And then my second question is just on the recent agreement with IBM. I'm just curious that we should be thinking about any synergies there whether that would be cost the revenue from consolidating that outsourcing partner? Rami Rahim : Yes. Ken Miller : And the primary thing you should there you will see there is actually some efficiencies on cost side that source of large part of our IT organization to IBM. It should enable efficiencies due to their scale and automation that they built over years. So we are very excited about the opportunity to keep our service levels high for our customers and our IT service levels high but actually get a benefit on the cost side over the term of the IBM contract. Rami Rahim : Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you over the next couple of months. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks we will take questions. Please lime yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. The March quarter played out largely as expected total revenue of $1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance, as we experienced slightly better than anticipated trends across each of our core verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 came in above our guidance range due to better than expected sales, stronger gross margins, continued cost controls and higher interest income, which together offset a higher than anticipated tax rate and share count. We're pleased with the progress we experienced versus our forecast. However, we are not satisfied with our Q1 results and remain laser focused on delivering a return to growth later this year. We believe we remain on track to achieve this objective and I'd like to walk through some of the items that are driving confidence in our ability to achieve this goal. First, we are continuing to invest in our go to market organization, which underwent a restructuring and a change in leadership earlier this year. While changes such as these are never easy and our actions created some anticipated headwinds, we saw improved momentum through the course of the quarter. Based on this momentum, I'm increasingly confident we have the right sales structure and strategy in place to win in the market. We are now in the process of adding sales headcount, which I believe should help accelerate our momentum through the course of the year. Second, we are continuing to see healthy trends in our Enterprise business. While this vertical was most impacted by the go to market disruption we experienced in the start of the year, Enterprise still experienced 3% year-over-year growth in Q1. Normalizing for an unusually large financial services transaction a year ago, our run rate Enterprise business grew double-digits in the quarter, which we think highlights the underlying health of the business. We remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our Enterprise business, which we believe is likely to see the greatest impact from our investment in incremental go to market headcount, as well as the recent acquisition of Mist Systems which closed in the second quarter. Third and building upon this last point, we're very excited about the acquisition of Mist Systems, a pioneer in cloud managed, wireless networks, powered by artificial intelligence. We believe Mist is truly disruptive technology and the early feedback from both customers and the field has been very positive. We are early in the process of integrating Mist into our go to market motion and educating the field on how to sell the company's products. While we do not expect Mist to generate material revenue during the 2019, we believe the Mist portfolio positions Juniper to disrupt the $6 billion wireless LAN market and pull-through sales of our campus switching solutions which could positively impact our results later in the year. Fourth, we are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the first quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings with revenue from our Contrail family of SDN-enabled management and control software solutions increasing nearly 40% year-over-year. While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as we introduce new products and new business models designed to better monetize the value of our offerings over the next few quarters. Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 3% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well, driving strong services attach rates and renewals. While not a surprise, we continue to experience weakness within the cloud and service provider verticals. Our cloud business remains challenged as several of our large customers continue to run their networks hatter and the pace of port deployments was not great enough to offset ASP declines. While this dynamic caused our cloud revenue to accelerate as expected during the March quarter, we were encouraged to see a pickup in order toward the end of the period, which is providing confidence that momentum should improve over the next few quarters. Based on the capacity demand we are currently seeing, we remain confident we are holding our cloud footprint in the areas of the network where we have historically played. While we see the potential for improved port growth in our existing footprint to drive a return to growth over time, new use cases will be needed to achieve our long-term model. We are laser focused on capturing this opportunity and view 400 gig as an inflection point that creates opportunities for wins later this year that should drive share gains in future period. Our current product roadmap and strong customer relationships are driving confidence in our ability to secure these net new use cases in the cloud, particularly in the data center where we have a little present today. Within the service provider vertical, we continue to experience headwinds tied to our customer's business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments. While we believe our service provider business is likely to remain challenged during the June quarter, we do expect the vertical to experience better trends during the second half of the year. We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and with our new MX 5G line cards about to start shipping, the Ericsson relationship off to a good start and our Contrail orchestration platform deeply entrenched at a number of global Tier 1 service providers, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on carrier 5G and telco cloud initiatives that are likely to start playing out later this year. I think it's worth highlighting that we are in the early stages of launching several important new products that should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets. Some of these anticipated products include, new MX 5G line cards that will enhance our 5G positioning and ability to capitalize on service provider capacity requirements. New QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail enterprise multi cloud software capabilities that break down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost. New cloud delivered enterprise capabilities that enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities and new silicon photonics capabilities that potentially open new addressable market and enhance our competitive position during the 400 gig cycle. We believe 5G, the 400 gig upgrade cycle, SD enterprise and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives each represent large multi-year opportunities where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years. Based on our current pipeline of opportunities, we expect to see normal seasonal trends during the June quarter. While we expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year and return to year-over-year growth during the fourth quarter, we do see the potential for seasonality to have some impact during the September quarter. Importantly, we remain confident in the long-term model we highlighted at our November 2018 Investor Day. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. First quarter revenue of 1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance. In addition non-GAAP gross margin at 59.3% was toward the higher end of our guidance range. These results, along with prudent expense management and higher than anticipated other income build non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 above our guidance range. Looking at revenue by vertical, results were largely in line with our expectations. Enterprise increased 3% year-over-year. Sequentially enterprise decreased 20% which is more than normal seasonality. As expected, our enterprise business was impacted by transitions in our go to market organization. Service provider decreased 9% year-over-year and 16% sequentially due to weakness across all geographies. Cloud decreased 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. While cloud capacity continue to grow, the growth in units was not enough to offset expected ASP erosion. From a technology perspective, routing decreased 8% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Switching decreased to 23% year-over-year and sequentially. Security decreased 7% year-over-year and 35% sequentially. Our services business increased 3$ year-over-year, but decreased 5% sequentially. Software grew year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were cloud, six were service provider and one was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $140 million, down 12% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. For the first quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%. The stronger than expected non-GAAP margin was primarily due to lower service costs and increased software. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $159 million. The primary reason for the sequential decline was due to lower net income, partially offset by net changes in working capital. We continue to execute our capital return program paying $66 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2019 was $3.5 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repayment of our $350 million bond that matured in the quarter. We continue to focus on maintaining an efficient capital structure. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide you some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects normal seasonal trends, and while we expect revenue grow on a sequential basis beyond the second quarter, we do expect to see some impact from seasonality in Q3. We expect to return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We remain confident in our long-term financial model that we outlined at our Investor Day in November of last year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to improve directionally with revenue volume from Q1 '19 levels and we believe gross margin for the year will be toward the midpoint of our long-term model. We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently; however, we expect the Mist Systems acquisition will be dilutive to earnings in 2019. Based on our current forecast we expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be lower than Q1'19 levels. We expect higher interest income compared to the prior years due to favourable interest rates. Due to the impact of the acquisition of Mist Systems and a higher than anticipated tax rate, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 plus or minus $0.05 for 2019. If not for these items, our previous non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year would remain unchanged. The accelerated share repurchase program or ASR initially planned for Q1 '19 was delayed due to the acquisition of Mist Systems. We now anticipate entering into an ASR for approximately three $300 million this quarter, reflecting our continued conviction in our future prospects. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Vijay Bhagavath : Hi. My question is in the back half, please help us understand two big product cycles out there Wi-Fi 6 [ph] 400 gig in the cloud. Are these weighted more towards the fourth quarter or we could see any actions targeting the September quarter? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Vijay. So there is in fact a number of different product cycles that we're expecting will help this year. I think it starts with just our routing portfolio, in particular the MX 5G line card upgrades and we anticipate that those will shift this quarter. And typically the ramp for products like that where there is a large deployed base will start in the second half of the year. So that does feed into the confidence that we have in the second half. I've talked at length about the 400 gig, pretty broad product transition that cuts across routing and switching. The main focus for 400 gig will be on Wind [ph] this year that will feed into volume deployments and share next year. And then you mentioned wireless LAN, that's obviously a new and very important area of focus for us. There are a number of opportunities that we're seeing already in the early stages of integrating Mist into our portfolio and you know, not just in terms of wireless LAN, but the - it looks like our thesis for the pull-through effect of wireless LAN into other areas, like security and switching is playing out as expected thus far. So I'm quite optimistic about that. And then the Wi-Fi 6 standard that's going to be coming about, I think starts to work its way into volume deployments, not probably latter half of this year and into next year. So we're well-equipped to capture that trend as well. But I do believe that even prior to that we're going to see some good growth in that area. Vijay Bhagavath : Thanks, Rami. A quick follow up for Ken if I may. Ken, you know recently you mentioned about, like staffing up sales headcount, how should we think about OpEx as percentage of revenue and you know any dynamics on the product gross margin line heading into the back half? Thanks. Ken Miller : Yeah. So we did talk about full year OpEx for the year would be flat to slightly up. That is the last call we talked about it being approximately slow. So I do expect it to be flat to slightly up, that is a slight change, that is predominantly due to the Mist acquisition which as we mentioned on the Mist acquisition call a couple of months ago, it is going to be dilutive this year, the acquisition of Mist, but we do expect it to be accretive next year. So that OpEx is now in our forecast. In addition to that, I do - we are investing a bit in sales. Now a lot of the sales investment is being fueled or funded by some of the transformation we've already done in sales. We've taken some cost out, but we are putting more back in, so we will see a little bit of OpEx growth on the go to market side as well. But overall our OpEx as percentage of revenue should improve as I expect revenue to grow sequentially much faster and you know, that OpEx. Vijay Bhagavath : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Kvaal : Yes. I guess, I have a question and a clarification if I could. I think first on the question, when should we start to hear about progress in 400. Are you going to be able to share that in the second half? And to what extent do you have confidence that you'll be able to win on both the switching and potentially on the routing side as well? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks for the question Jeff. So we're doing everything. At this point right now we're laser focused on the 400 gig opportunity that is ahead of us. And there is obviously a big technology dimension to this and across the entire technology stack from our software capabilities, we've - as I've mentioned in the past made some very meaningful modifications and enhancements to our operating system to provide the modularity, the API program ability that our cloud customers want. We're working very closely with our big hyperscale cloud provider, as well as the Tier 2 worldwide cloud providers and meeting some of the specific requirements that they have, sometimes for example in terms of hosting third party agents that are very important to their network deployments. We're also, I believe based on what we know today, we have made exactly the right decisions in choosing merchant silicon technology for some parts or some layers of the data center network and our own custom silicon technology that I actually believe quite strongly that should give us some meaningful advantage and differentiation from a - especially a cost performance and the power efficiency standpoint. And then of course, there's engagement. Right now the engagement level with our large cloud provider customers is very high, engineer to engineer and talking about specific opportunities, what's required to capture them. I have no doubt this is going to be a very competitive space, but I'm quite confident that we're doing everything that we can. And we have a very competitive portfolio that will allow us to take share. You know, in terms of when it will become visible. Winds [ph] are rarely announced in this space. Our customers, our cloud customers in particular tend to be somewhat quiet about this. But I do think if we start to secure layers of the network, in particular data center interconnect and the data center itself that will start to contribute meaningfully to revenue next year. Jeffrey Kvaal : Okay, perfect. And then my second more of a clarification. Do you feel like the changes in the enterprise go to market strategy are behind you now and we should get back to that low double-digit growth rate in the second quarter and through the balance of the year? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So, no doubt there was some disruption in Q1 as we had anticipated and these changes are never easy, but honestly I'm very happy that we went through them. I do believe that the hard part is behind us. I think we have a much more efficient sales organization. Right now we removed layers, we increased span of control, we of course changed leadership and all of that I believe is going to result in better sales execution in the future. There still as we mentioned upfront some hiring to do to fill some of the gaps we've created in the sales organization or the opportunities I should say in the sales organization where we're going to be primarily focusing on you know front lines, native quota carrying sales representatives, across the whole segment, but in particular in the enterprise segment, we'll be filling those opportunities throughout the rest of the year. And I'm very optimistic and in fact confident that this will start to help us in the second half of the year. So part of our confidence in the improved sequential performance of the company comes from the fact that we're investing now in sales that will help us in the second part of this year and certainly into next year. Jeffrey Kvaal : Thank you, Rami. Rami Rahim : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hi, guys. A couple for me. First, Rami you've kind of laid out a very detailed new product roadmap here. It sounds like the next couple two, three quarters are going to be very busy from a refresh cycle standpoint. I guess, how do I get my hands around the risks that are associated with the refresh in the context of potentially customers pausing ahead of a refresh, how you accounting for that in your outlook for the year? Rami Rahim : Yeah. We don't anticipate a lot of overhang or pausing in anticipation of new products that are coming. There's always some element of risk associated with that when you're introducing new products. But honestly I don't believe that it's going to be a big factor and certainly we've weaved that or we have anticipated that in the outlook that we have provided. Ittai Kidron : Okay. Very good. And then with regards to Mist, can you be a little bit more specific with respect to the contribution of Mist in the June quarter, how much revenue you expect this to deliver and perhaps how was - how big is the headcount that you've added to with this acquisition? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So we mentioned previously that we do expect it to be dilutive for this year and accretive next. All of the OpEx we take on day one and they're still in a ramp mode for revenue obviously. They have fairly immature amounts of revenue and we take in fairly immature amounts into this calendar year. That said, they're growing quite nicely and we do see it as a very strategic opportunity to insert into net new customers. But from a revenue perspective, particularly Q2 revenue it's quite immaterial, but we should start to ramp from there. Ittai Kidron : Rami, when you look at Mist, how quickly do you think they get fully incorporated into your sell cycle. Are they going to be kept separate from a sales standpoint or mandated to sell Juniper gear [ph] as well? Help me think about that. Rami Rahim : Yeah. So we are largely keeping Mist as a standalone entity within the company with the goal of ensuring that the momentum that they've seen over the last couple of years not only continues but accelerates. We're focusing primarily now on educating and enabling our broad sales organization to be able to sell the technology. And we're keeping the sales - the Mist most sales team as a standalone specialist team that can go after net new wireless LAN opportunity. And like I said earlier, so far we're seeing that it's become a great door opener for us in net new accounts where we have an opportunity to sell more of the portfolio, in addition of course to wireless LAN. Now over time, there will be more technical integration. But honestly we're being cautious, careful and taking our time. As you might have seen we announced not too long ago a software defined enterprise offering that comes across as the WAN, as the security, SD switching and we have done some integration with Mist already to provide a holistic solution for enterprise customers. And so thus far the reception from customers, although it's early has been really encouraging. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck, guys. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first touch on - and sort of try and understand product mix versus vertical mix, in that I would expect that that routing would tend to be stronger than service provider and cloud and less strong in the Enterprise group, yet the vertical mix sort of moved in the wrong direction in terms of relative to what I'd expect on product mix. Could you help me sort of think about the correlation between your product groups and your verticals? Thank you. And I have a follow up. Rami Rahim : Sure. So yeah, I mean, you're right that SP [ph] is predominantly routing. We've talked about that at on analyst day, I want to say 80% plus of our service provider business is routing. Cloud is majority is routing, but switching actually has a bigger share than it doesn't say service provider. But still the majority of our cloud business has been routing, has always been that case, that way. With an enterprise, it's predominately switching and security and - but we have a very - over the last several quarters we've been actually growing our routing business, albeit it's still the third in rank order of technologies into that vertical. Simon Leopold : Can you explain that quarter because the movement was the opposite, routing got better, but service provider and cloud are weak and enterprise was strong, so that's where I'm confused Rami Rahim : I mean, all verticals were down and all technologies were down sequentially. I think you're better comment is more about tempering of growth rates. But you know, on a year-on-year basis we did see routing down eight and service provider down nine, pretty highly correlated. Enterprise was the one vertical they grew on a year-on-year basis and the one technology that grew within enterprise, actually two technologies, routing and a little bit of security growth within enterprise switching was down in enterprise. It's worth mentioning that some of the newer routing products that we've introduced over the last year have been really optimized for net new footprint, where we have not really participated in the past in the route, in the enterprise space. So products like the MX10003, the MX204 have been very well received by the enterprise market. Simon Leopold : That's helpful Rami. So just to follow up, I wanted to get a perspective of you - in terms of your longer term vision on your silicon photonics products that you discussed at the Optical Trade Show in March. So I understand you're really just getting started, but we've sized the market for data center transceivers at maybe 1.5 kind of plus billion for 100 gig. I just want to get your sense of where you think you can take that particular business as you grow it? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah. I appreciate the question. So we remain optimistic, excited about the silicon photonics opportunity. I mean, the fact of the matter is, there is a large part of the network investment that happens by our customers. That's not in the network elements themselves, but it's in the interconnect between networking elements. We've always looked at the 100 gig cycle as an opportunity to learn, because 100 gig cycle as you know is very mature right now. There are a number of offerings that are in the market right now. Pricing is already quite competitive and we are doing just that from 100 gig. We have run into some challenges with our 100 gig silicon photonics efforts, not in the core technology, but in the assembly level 400 gig. And those - the lessons from that are all feeding their way into 400 gig and we decided basically we're going to emphasize or put most of our energy and attention on getting 400 gig and the goal for 400 gig will be to release 400 gig optics using our core, very differentiated IP technology right at the beginning of the volume deployment for 100 gig. So whereas we had anticipated shipping, you know, 100 gig products in the first half of the year, I would say that's not going to happen, but we're on track to deliver the 400 gig product where I believe the opportunity to really differentiate from an economic standpoint in time for the volume ramps. Simon Leopold : And you think that's maybe the turn of the calendar year? Rami Rahim : Is around that time frame, yes. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you very much for that. Helpful. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cohen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : Thanks, Ken, did I hear you correctly that you expect gross margins to hit the midpoint of your 58% to 62% fiscal '19 through '21 guidance this year, was that the comment? Ken Miller : Yeah. So for full year FY '19, I expect margin to be approximate the midpoint, which is 60%. Paul Silverstein : And can you discuss the visibility and the opportunities and risks to getting there. And I recognize it's a journey and there's still a ways to go. But can you talk about the ability to get to the higher end of that 58% to 62% range. What it will take and what timeframe? Ken Miller : Yeah. So to get to the higher end it really comes down to mix and most of it is product mix that drives our margin more than anything. In addition, between now and the end of this year volumes will definitely play a factor in a positive way. So as we gain more volume this helps out our fixed cost, variable cost ratio, so that improves margin quite significantly as we ramp up throughout the year. But going forward long term, the answer is predominantly in mix. You'll see more software sales is obviously a positive. And then having you know, the value engineering that we've been doing, the design for value efforts, we've been doing across all of our platforms. We've talked a lot about 400 gig just as an example, those platforms we believe are going to better cost performance than our previous generation routing and switching lineups. So we should see improvements, on kind of like-to-like product, but more significantly mix is the biggest factor moving forward. Paul Silverstein : Ken, any change in pricing dynamics in the marketplace? Ken Miller : We definitely have the pricing ASP erosion built into our long-term model. We're presuming those are going to be you know, normal kind of trends. There's nothing that we're expecting beyond kind of typical you know, cost per bit kind of price erosion. Paul Silverstein : No accelerations? Ken Miller : No. Paul Silverstein : Great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Ken Miller : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. You talk about improved cloud orders toward the end of the quarter and you're making incremental sales investments into the enterprise. So I wonder how might you rank order the incremental growth opportunities by vertical over the next one to two years. You did lay out detailed targets at Analyst Day, but a lot has changed since then. Rami Rahim : Yeah, thanks for the question. So in terms of cloud, I think this is going be a year of stability. Basically last year was you know was a tough year. We saw some meaningful declines as a result of the product transition. This year, I think we can say that the bulk of that product transition is behind us and we are in stability and rebuild mode off of you know, the base that we have created for ourselves now coming into this year. I remain optimistic, that we have retained our footprint. We have done everything that is within our control and power to ensure that we are you know very relevant within our hyperscale cloud and our broader cloud customers. And I've talked at length about the technology that we have been working on will introduce into the market to see growth from here. And you know with the addition of net new footprint, I believe that the long term model that we provided in our Analyst event in November of last year is certainly within our grasp. As far as the other two verticals you know, as you know in the SPE [ph] space, we anticipate that there is going to be - it's going remain a dynamic environment. Our service fighter customers are dealing with business model challenges of their own, and so for that reason our longer term outlook, our long term model has been slight declines in SP. I do believe that there are catalysts that could improve things in the future. We're just not baking that into our model at this point. Things like 5G, our telco cloud, transformation efforts where we're essentially now building a new muscle and emotion in the SP space to help them transform their central offices into essentially service next generation highly automated service delivery engine. And the way we monetize that is not just through boxes, but by selling software. In particular, our Contrail software suite. And enterprise is where I believe we should see growth this year, despite the fact that we lost the momentum in the Q1 period, primarily because of the trend - the changes that we made in the go to market organization, I believe that the market opportunity remains healthy. There's a lot of growth potential for us across both the data center, as well as the campus environment. We as you know have made now investments, including M&A, in Mist systems that I believe gives us a really compelling portfolio. So I'm actually quite bullish on growth for the enterprise all of this year. Tejas Venkatesh : And as a follow up, revenue this year will be similar to 2011. Now I know you're making organic investments and you've acquired Mist. But I wonder if there's been any additional thinking on M&A and what other parts of the portfolio you might want to round out. And is that why you have inked this $500 million credit revolver? Rami Rahim : Yeah. In terms of M&A, I would say that if you look at what we did with Mist systems, it's a good example of the kind of what I would say really value creating M&A opportunities that we would pursue to accelerate a strategy that we were already embarking on. You know, we have seen now for two years solid year-over-year growth in the enterprise space. We believe that the shift in the enterprise towards cloud delivered SaaS software based offerings is creating new opportunities. In fact, levelling the playing kph field, whereas in the past it was much more difficult to compete. We have our own organic efforts that we have put into the market that have helped us in achieving the momentum thus far. And we look to inorganic ideas like Mist systems that can only accelerate the pace of growth and that's a wonderful example of what we would be thinking about going forward as well. Ken Miller : On a credit revolver side, I would urge you not to read too much into that, that's just really a timing situation, we had a revolver before, it was a five year life. It expires. We re-opt for another five years effectively. This I just think is good hygiene, it's a low cost, access to quick cash if needed. We have never drawn against our revolver in the past. At this point, I don't anticipate having to draw against this one either. It's just nice to have as a backstop. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I want to come back to this OpEx issue and you know the fact that 100 gig is doesn't sound like it's going to be available in Q2, but it's only - I mean, that's less than two months since I guess you guys talked about so look at the [indiscernible] And so I wonder when did you determine that it wasn't going to be available? And then I also want to clarify whether are you saying that you'll still deliver 100 gig at about the same time as 400 gig or are you skipping this? Can you just clarify what the roadmap now looks like with respect to those different speed technologies? Rami Rahim : Yeah, Rod. Thanks for the question. I'm happy to clarify. So we've always thought about 100 gig as an opportunity for us to essentially flush out the technology, prove that the core technology works and then really make meaningful progress in terms of market share capture and differentiating our products in the 400 gig cycle, primarily because 100 gig have been - it's already a very mature market today. In terms of timing of the assembly issues, it's very recent and we'll make a decision on 100 gigs later this year and we're certainly happy to keep you posted on that. But again, I want to emphasize the fact that we've always thought that 400 gig is where the opportunity largely lies. And I do believe that we'll be able to capture that opportunity the beginning of volume ramps, which is really around the beginning of next year. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks, Rami. And then I wanted to just - this is more of a clarification, but just as I look at the revenue trajectory, you guys are saying seasonality in Q3, but the last couple of years seasonality has been down quarter-on-quarter, so I'm assuming you're saying up a little bit, like low single digits in Q3. But if that's the case then your Q4 to get the year-over-year growth you've got to be up $50 million or $100 million, not you know, not maybe quite that much, but at least 50 sequentially and that's a pretty good sized quantum of revenue that you've got to achieve in the fourth quarter. And I just wonder, it sounds like you feel pretty confident on the MX 5G line cards, but how much visibility do you have there and why do you have confidence you can get to growth in December? Ken Miller : Let me talk about the seasonality and then I'll let - Rami, do you want to touch on the confidence in Q4. But - so you know, first of all to start off with this year is largely playing out as we expected, including the second half. We've been calling for improved second half trends throughout the whole year and historically it's important to note that Q2 and Q4 are typically our strongest quarter season from a sequential perspective, Q1 and Q3 have been challenged. To your point, the last couple of years. Q3 has been kind of flattish. We do expect to do better and flat. We expect some sequential growth in Q3. But I think you know, about 3% is a good kind of expectation for Q3, about 3% sequential growth, which would be better than historical seasonal. But you know, kind of - you know, not as robust as Q2 and Q4, we expect goes to be stronger sequential quarters for us. Rami Rahim : As far as the qualitative assessment of the second half, I'd say there are a number of things that give us some confidence. First is, we do have visibility into timing the of buildout. In the SP space in particular, but also in the enterprise and the cloud. A big part of the sales transformation that we embarked on in the Q4 and Q1 has been around improving our forecast - forecasting rigour and I think we're going to start to see more of that benefit as we go - as this year plays out. It's already I believe helped us. Second, I mentioned that coming out of Q1 we were encouraged by the momentum, relative to when how the quarter started, that I think feeds into our confidence. The sales investment, we we've essentially through the tough decisions and actions that we've made created the opportunity for us to invest in sales and I think that the product pipeline supports that investment. And then yes, the innovation, both the organic innovation MX 5G, our software enhancements that we've made across all of our products really, especially in terms of management and simplicity of our switching, and then our security assets. And then last but not least, you know, our inorganic efforts with Mist that I think start to help in the latter part of the year as well. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. I just wanted to start off with the security business. Can you just help me understand the lumpiness you're seeing there? You had a good quarter in 4Q and then new 1Q you had a softer quarter. Can you just help us understand the lumpiness there? And can you also talk about kind of what you seeing in terms of discussions with some of these service providers relative to your security portfolio? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Happy to address that. So security, we certainly lost some momentum in the Q1 period. Now a big part of that was the fact that there is a component of our security business that's very lumpy because it's essentially captured or its product that's sold to large customers in the cloud and service provider space. So whereas we had healthy cloud and SP spending in the Q4 period, we just had much less of that in Q1 period. There's no good reason other than just timing of deployments. Despite the fact that I do believe the sales transition had an impact, we actually saw our security grow on a year-over-year basis in the enterprise space, but I think that momentum has continued. Looking forward for security, I think that the investment in go to market is going to help, especially on the enterprise side. In terms of the portfolio, we recently introduced the - or have significantly enhanced the high end of our security portfolio and we're seeing a lot of interest, especially in cloud and service provider, as well as some large enterprises, like financial services and banking. In that product line, now many of the interest today shows up in terms of proof of concept testing, validation of features, et cetera. And that has a good potential of translating to sales and revenue in the up quarters. And the last thing I wanted to say about security is that, we've really now integrated security into our solutions, our enterprise focused, service provider focused solutions. So if you take for example our software defined enterprise offering, that includes wireless LAN, now that includes switching. It also includes security with a single pane of glass, very simple, management interface that very much appeals to the enterprise market. We're thinking about security as a component of a portfolio sale increasingly and that has worked for us in the past. I think it's going to work for us going forward. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Can I quickly ask for an update, on at the Investor Day you talked about rolling out subscription offerings in the Frontiers [ph] and can we just ask for update where you stand ready for that. Is that something that's coming through in the remainder of the year or ramping up kind of as we go through to kind of the remaining quarters here? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question. So we did see good year-over-year growth in security - sorry in software and as we mentioned software is starting to contribute an increasingly significant portion of total revenue for the company. This is very much a part of the strategy that we have been executing on for the last couple of years. It cuts across both on-box software offerings, as well as off-box offerings. You're right we presented to you at the November Analyst Day a very simple uniform business model around software for all of our products that we introduced into the market starting this year. And as an example of that the MX 5G products that will be shipped this quarter will adhere to that new simple model. It will have a base perpetual component. And then the opportunity to up sell into additional features and value using subscription models. So I expect that all of this effort, the energy, that the simplicity of the model that we've introduced is going to actually help us achieve our long-term projections for security or switching as a component of sales which is up 16% by 2021. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, great. Thanks for the update. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Cloud business. If I go back over the last few quarters we've had lots of conversations about the MX, the PJX transition and you know obviously if I go back that was a big source of erosion in terms of you know, the price realization per gig that you were getting. And we got the impression that you guys were you know through the meat of that transition. But if I look at the financials here, I mean we're still seeing down I think 18% year on year. It seems like - and you're saying there's capacity growth among that customer set. So it feels like we're still getting pretty significant erosion here. I guess, I was trying to understand you know exactly what the dynamic is. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. So you're right in that, the bulk of the transition, the product transition is behind us at this point. We're not entirely through it, but we're mostly through it at this point. I think the bigger impact right now is really around the pace and the timing of deployments. And you know, as painful as the product transition was I do it all over again because it has resulted in us now be holding the footprint that's so important for us, that will event eventually translate to growth and will give us the opportunity to sell into net new footprint. What I look at - when I look at the cloud space is even though the CapEx spending might moderate, I look at the businesses of our cloud customers and across the boards you see that they are all crushing it, they're doing amazing things with their businesses. And as a result of that they will need to continue to invest in their networks. I think that eventually helps us in the routing space where we have the strength and it's exceptionally important for us to grow into net new footprint which we're doing, as I mentioned everything we need to do from a technology and engagement standpoint that will enable us to grow. Going forward the last the last thing I'll just mention is, you know exiting the Q1 period we did see a pick up in momentum that has fed into our confidence that we should see sequential improvement from this Q1 low. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Rami Rahim : Hey, Tal. Are you there? Operator : Tal, your line is now live. Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. James Fawcett : Yeah. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask really quickly on Mist, we've heard some positive feedback on from channel partners et cetera on that product and you've talked about like hopefully being able to pull that through or use that to pull through other Juniper products into the enterprise et cetera. Do you - I know you're not expecting revenue directly from Mist to contribute much this year, but really ramp in 2020. But can you talk about like what the time to, I guess training and productivity and how we should think about starting to see evidence of Mist traction and how it can help the rest of the portfolio? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks for the question James. So first I will re-emphasize that I truly believe that Mist is very unique technology in the industry that brings to bear their AI capabilities, the cloud management, superior visibility and very importantly the scale to capture a very large enterprise customers that other solutions - that are cloud managed just simply don't have the capability of doing. We are already in the middle of training our broad sales team worldwide to understand how to articulate the value proposition of the product. I personally have been involved in many of the early customer conversations and have heard firsthand the excitement from those customers and I have seen again firsthand how Mist can be used as a door opener that gives us the opportunity to position other products. So not meaningful from a revenue standpoint in the Q2 period, I do believe that it starts to be meaningful based on net new footprint, based on the capability of our broad sales team, to position the technology, you know, in the latter part of this year and certainly I believe it becomes now accretive to us next year. And I think it's important to note that I mean, Mist has sold [ph] with the hardware, as well as the software delivered from the cloud, so that software also is going to be recognized ratably over a period of time. So although the bookings, you know, ones will start to come sooner rather later, the revenue will be drawn out a bit, which is in line with our long-term kind of software subscription model. James Fawcett : Got it. And thanks for the clarification on recognition, that's helpful. Ken, just a follow up question. Normally I hate to kind of parse guidance and language, but I just want to understand is that - in the first quarter you posted $0.05 of EPS upside, you're saying excluding the impact of taxes and the Mist acquisition that your EPS guidance would remain unchanged for the year. And it seems like at least, where you're pointing people for revenue, at least for the third quarter is a little bit below where the street is. So I'm just wondering where those deltas, like why they're emerging and what's different maybe then perhaps how at the very least the street had things modeled and kind of what's making for those small changes if you will? Ken Miller : Yes, I would say kind of at the highest level. Revenue is largely in line with what we expected for the full year. I mean, I do think Q3 - you know I already mentioned I think you bringing that growth rate to 3% makes more sense to me, given the seasonality we normally see in Q3 is a tough quarter for us, but the upside in Q1 somewhat offsets any of the model there. So I think the full year is largely in line. The biggest change of the year is going to be OpEx, you know, OpEx I do think will be flat to slightly up, whereas before we thought approximately flat, plus or minus, so and now taking flat, plus and that's largely... James Fawcett : Sorry - sorry just to make clear. So it's flattish, it's flat up slightly up, plus Mist or because of Mist acquisition? Ken Miller : Because of Mist, because of Mist. James Fawcett : Right. Right. Ken Miller : Because of Mist, and that's you know, that's now downs now Juniper, right. So that's now baked into our full year OpEx expectation. The other thing I would mention is tax rate. You know I do think it's going to trend up from last year's levels, it improve from Q1. The tax rate would be a bit of a headwind. Last but not least, into the ASR timing which pushed, we expect to that in Q1. Now it's going to be done in Q2. We expect we do have some favorableness on the other income line due to interest rate improvement. But those are kind of the puts and takes to the full year EPS guidance. James Fawcett : That's great. Thank you so much for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. My question really pertains to Juniper legacy Xmas [ph] networks or Mist Systems and more specifically if I look at your customer revenue mixes across enterprise, telecom and cable and cloud and from 1Q 2018 to 4Q '18 you did have a year on year ramp in your revenue growth rate. And as we think about 2019 excluding Mist, do you expect to see a very similar type of ramp going through 2019, as we saw in 2018 mainly driven by enterprises? And maybe I have a follow up after that. Rami Rahim : Yes. So we absolutely expect sequential growth in revenue throughout this year. Mist, it will be a factor but not the reason. I mean, Mist will be relatively immaterial to the grand scheme of kind of Juniper's size and scale from a revenue perspective, but it should growth as well, but it won't be the driver of the overall growth of Juniper. We expect sequential growth. Enterprise as the one vertical that we expect full year growth, year-on-year we expect that momentum to continue and actually accelerate as we kind of move through the salesforce transition that we - that we were kind of in the middle of exiting and moving on to more productivity as we're hiring more sales folks. Cloud NSP, We also expect sequential growth off of Q1 levels and actually off of the Q2 guide, we expect sequential growth. Sami Badri : Got it. And just to be clear, this is all excluding - is it excluding Mist throughout this ramp, right, the enterprise commentary? Rami Rahim : Correct. Yes, yes. Sami Badri : Okay. Rami Rahim : We view Mist as an accelerator [ph] obviously, I mean, Mist will accelerate our enterprise plan that we had, an organic plan without Mist. We did believe we would grow enterprise. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. The other follow up. I really have is regarding Mist and dilution now based on how the numbers have actually come about, I guess the dilution dynamic is between $0.5 and $0.15 of dilution from the acquisition. I know you guys can give us a tangible number, but are we on the higher end of this range or in the lower end of this range? Ken Miller : So that the guide that we gave up prior to Mist was a $1.80, plus or minus 5 and revise that to $1.75, plus or minus five. So about $0.05 is the guide down and that encompasses Mist, as well as some tax rate adjustment, somewhat offset by interest income. Sami Badri : Got it. And then just this is kind of more thinking like afar [ph] just given the announcement of Mist and as Contrail progresses, but - what would you anticipate the software revenue mix of total revenues probably a year out from today, just given there are a lot of moving pieces and changes occurring in the model, they will kick off 2020. What would be a reasonable mix assume or to shoot for in the model just from software? Rami Rahim : So we have - we have the target of 16% for 20 21, I expect us to directly grow towards that between now and there. You know, it's not going to be perfectly linear, but I think from a forecasting perspective some sort of linear progression between here and there would be probably the best model. Jess Lubert : Operator, we're going to take one more question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva : Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I would say the best question for the last, but anyway. Regarding your commentary at the beginning, you mentioned customers are sweating their assets. Typically when that happens there's a certain duration then they absolutely have to come back and they come back feasting and indulging themselves on purchasing orders or something has structurally changed like you know some type of data compression or some type of optimization programs or something. Can you help us understand is that true in the situation from where you sit and see or has something changed because at some point the sweating cannot continue with the heated assets? Rami Rahim : So I believe you're referring to the commentary we made around the cloud\u2026 Jim Suva : Correct. Rami Rahim : Customers essentially running their networks a little hotter. Jim Suva : Correct. Rami Rahim : And like I said earlier, when I look at the business performance of our cloud customers, they can't achieve that performance on a continuous basis and deliver the kind of experience that's so important for them to their customers without investing in their networks. So I - even if spending moderates, I do believe that this remains an incredible opportunity for us and this is why we're investing in it. So yeah, my belief is that cloud is in fact a growth opportunity for Juniper. There might be some ebbs and flows in the business based on deployment cycles, but network investment is going to be required and we're ready to capture that investment with a footprint that we have, as well as the you know all the effort that we're making to capture net new footprint. Jim Suva : When do you think that will happen, I mean, at some point, I mean, they're just killing it with their you know trends and so it seems like it's got to be sooner or am I wrong with that because your outlook doesn't look like it's coming pretty quick? Rami Rahim : I think last year you know, we saw a meaningful decline, this year I think we get to stability and then next year I think we can start to get to growth. And I believe that the long term model that we provided for cloud which is growth is absolutely in the cards, especially as we capture net new footprint and new cloud customers worldwide. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Rami Rahim : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks. Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter came in largely as we had expected. Total revenue of $1,102 million were towards the midpoint of our guidance and in line with normal seasonal trends for the June quarter. We experienced sequential growth across all verticals and technologies with a notable sequential improvement in our cloud vertical, which stabilized on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 came in a $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast, as strong cost controls more than offset the impact from the recent increase in China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate in the period. The first-half of 2019 played out largely as we expected and we are seeing healthy momentum in several areas of our business, which is providing confidence in our ability to not only deliver sequential revenue growth through the remainder of the year, but also a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter. Now I\u2019d like to walk you through some of the highlights of the quarter and some of the items driving our confidence for the rest of the year. We experienced improved trends within our cloud business during the June quarter, due to an acceleration of some wide area deployments, which had previously been proceeding at a slower rate. While our cloud business is likely to remain lumpy on a go-forward basis and maybe down sequentially during the September quarter, current momentum is healthy and we feel good about the outlook of this business, especially now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. We continue to believe we are holding our footprints in our cloud customers wide area networks and our position to grow with their capacity requirements in the segments. While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture new use cases in the hyperscale market, particularly in the data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf Switching segments. On this last point, we have not only begun shipping our first merchant and custom silicon-based 400-gig capable product, but also introduced a cloud optimized version of Junos that we believe offers superior programmability, modularity and open API support needed to win the footprint we are targeting. We plan to introduce additional 400-gig capable products through the course of this year and next, and we believe we will further strengthen our ability to win new hyperscale use cases, or even a modest level of success to present material tailwind for our business in the years to come. We are continuing to see very healthy trends in the enterprise business. While our Q2 enterprise revenue declined 6% year-over-year, this is largely a function of timing as our enterprise bookings increased double-digit sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with sequential and year-over-year growth across all technologies, and we were able to build backlog on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. We believe we have the right product and strategy to win in the enterprise market and remain confident this vertical will grow for the year. This confidence is being fueled by the strength of our data center and campus offering, which we believe are differentiated and positioned to win in the market. In the data center, we believe the combination of Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud and our QFX switches offer a compelling value proposition for customers looking to move from single-vendor private cloud environments to a multi-vendor multi-cloud state. These trends are beginning to play out in the market now and should accelerate in the years to come. The value of our data center strategy is resonating in the market and Gartner for a second year in a row named Juniper as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. We are also confident that we are very well-positioned in the enterprise campus and branch market. With the acquisition of Mist Systems, we are now one of only two industry players that can offer a full portfolio of enterprise Wi-Fi switching, routing, security and SD-WAN solution. We believe our AI for enterprise capabilities are truly differentiated and that we are well-positioned to benefit as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 over the next several years. The Mist acquisition is proceeding well with strong field engagement and early wins providing optimism for our acquisition. In addition to maintaining a comprehensive campus and branch portfolio that brings differentiated AI, cloud management and security capabilities, I also want to highlight that we maintain a large established channel, a dedicated enterprise sales force where we are investing and more than 15,000 established enterprise customers, many of which we believe can be further monetized with these new solutions like SD-WAN and Mist. We believe these attributes differentiate us from our peers and should enable us to gain share in the years to come. We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 17% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the June quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings. While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 2% year-over-year and accounted for 35% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well driving strong service attach rates and renewals. While not a surprise, our service provider business remains challenge. We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and the weakness we\u2019re seeing is tied to our customers business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments. Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience better sequential trends during the second-half of the year, based on our current pipeline of known opportunity. With the availability of our new MX 5G line cards, the strength of our Contrail orchestration platform and our partnership with Ericsson, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on our service provider customers 5G and telco cloud initiative, which could begin to start playing out later this year. I think it\u2019s worth highlighting that we have begun to shift several important new products. While these platforms will take time to work through customer qualifications, they should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets. Some of these include new MX 5G line cards that enhance our ability to capitalize on the service provider capacity requirements, new QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud software capabilities that breaks down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost, and new SD-WAN capabilities to enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities. We believe 5G, the 400-gig upgrade cycle, SD-WAN, Wi-Fi 6 and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives, each represent large multi-year opportunities, where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years. Importantly, I would like to note that I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with our sales transformation. The changes we have made are already starting to yield benefits in the form of improved sales productivity and enhanced level of confidence in the pipeline driving our forecasts. We are now in the process of adding more quota-carrying sales headwinds to the field. While it is likely to take these new reps at least a few quarters to achieve full productivity, we do expect them to start contributing during the second-half of the year, with a further ramp in coverage and productivity that should present additional tailwind through the 2020. Based on these dynamics, I remain confidence in our ability to deliver sequential revenue growth during the second-half of the year and a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Second quarter revenue of $1,102 million was an increase of 10% sequentially and in line with our guidance. As expected, we saw sequential revenue growth across all verticals and all technologies. Looking at our revenue by vertical, Cloud increased 28%, Enterprise increased 8% and Service Provider increased 3% sequentially. From a technology perspective, Routing increased 11%, Switching increased 22% and Security increased 20% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider declined 15%, Cloud was flat and Enterprise declined 6%. Although enterprise revenue decreased year-over-year, our bookings increased double digits versus last year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased with our momentum and success in the enterprise vertical. Our services business continue to grow posting growth of 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strong renewals and attach rates of support contracts. Software revenue was a highlight growing year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. We had one customer from the cloud vertical that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to the increase in China tariffs from 10% to 25%. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to lower headcount-related cost and improving operating expense management. Headcount was slightly down sequentially, primarily as a result of outsourcing IT services to IBM, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Mist Systems and additional hires in our go-to-market organization. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40, a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. Looking at our balance sheet. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter were $2.9 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Mist Systems and our recent accelerated share repurchase program or ASR. We generated cash flow from operations of $89 million for the second quarter. The primary reasons for the sequential decline despite stronger net income, where lower cash collections and timing of working capital related to supplier payments. We expect to see stronger cash generation in the second-half of 2019. As part of our ongoing capital return program, we paid $66 million in dividends and entered into a $300 million ASR. Before we move onto Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our second-half revenue outlook reiterates the commentary we stated previously, which reflects our expectation for above normal seasonal trends and a return to growth in the fourth quarter, due to our current pipeline of opportunities, as well as the expected positive impact from our go-to-market transformation activities. I like to reiterate our confidence in the long-term financial model we outlined at our Investor Day in November last year. Full-year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to continue to be pressured by China tariffs. I\u2019m proud of our team as we\u2019ve been able to mitigate the vast majority of potential impact of the China tariffs. Despite these ongoing mitigation efforts, the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% is expected to have a 30 to 50 basis point impact on full-year non-GAAP gross margin. We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently. However, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full-year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018, inclusive of the acquisition of Mist Systems. In the second quarter of 2019, we adopted a full-year projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. For the remainder of 2019, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.5%. Due to the increased China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate, we now expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be at the low-end of the previously stated range of $1.75 per share plus or minus $0.05. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. Now I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you for taking the question, guys. Two quick questions. One, I know it\u2019s hard to discern how much of an improvement is due to macro and how much is improved competitive stance from execution? But that said, can you take a crack and get response to that question? And then I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up. Rami Rahim : Okay. Hey, Paul, thanks for the question. I think the improvement in cloud is very much based on the fact that we are now through the big product transition that we\u2019ve been talking about now for a year from MX to PTX. As a result of that, the blended pricing is now at a much more normalized level. And as we have been seeing, we\u2019ll see a recovery in that business based on the pace at which deployments happen in the routing space within the vertical and, in particular, in the hyperscale part of that vertical. In the enterprise, the strong year-over-year bookings and the sequential performance in that business, I believe that the combination of robust spending in the enterprise space, which we\u2019re taking advantage of, but certainly also a very strong product portfolio that spans both the data center, as well as the campus and branch. And, in particular, in the campus and branch now where we have the combination of a really strong portfolio in the wired switching space and now with what I believe to be the best wireless LAN solution with Mist Systems. So we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that. In the service provider space, it\u2019s really more of the same in terms of some of the market dynamics, but it\u2019s a challenging environment. We expect it to remain challenging for sometime, but there are some catalysts there over the long-term around 5G that can certainly help. Paul Silverstein : Rami, on the \u2013 on your responses on the cloud and enterprise, first, on the cloud. The MX \u2013 the PTX transition was a while ago, and since then, you\u2019ve been commenting that the volumes haven\u2019t come in. What\u2019s changed now, especially given that when a lot of us look at the CapEx trends in cloud, obviously, they\u2019re not what they were last year, albeit there have been some crosscurrents. What do you think it\u2019s changing as it relates to your product portfolio? And then on the enterprise, when you talk about strength and in demand, is that pretty uniform across the major geos, or is it particular in the U.S. or other markets? Rami Rahim : Yes. So on the \u2013 in the cloud space, now what we\u2019re seeing is essentially a reacceleration of some of the routing deployments among some of our largest cloud customers that we have benefited from. I expect that, we\u2019re going to see a continued recovery over the next few years in the cloud routing space, primarily because of the fact that their businesses are doing very well. And in order to continue to support their businesses, they\u2019re going to need to invest in their network infrastructure. In order to get to even better performance in the cloud vertical, we\u2019re very focused on net new footprint and use cases, especially as it in the switching space for data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf. In the enterprise, we saw really great strength in the government space internationally, but especially here in the U.S. And I think Europe and the U.S., in particular, were strong for us in the enterprise beyond government, right, and larger enterprise banks financials and the mid range of the market, which obviously spans many different verticals. Again, I do think that the spending environment there remains fairly robust and we\u2019re taking advantage of that. And I believe our technology roadmap and the products we have in the market are really strong. Ken Miller : Yes. Just to add on the cloud space, I agree that the PTX transition is largely behind us and I would say that the cloud vertical has largely stabilized. That said, any given 90-day period, you\u2019re going to see some lumpiness in our quarter-to-quarter revenue, based just on customer deployments. In fact, I would expect Q3 to be down slightly off of this very positive Q2 result. I do think the second-half will be largely in line or largely stable to the first-half, but I do think sequential decline in Q3 is expected. Paul Silverstein : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thank you. I wanted to see if maybe you could drill down a little bit more on your thoughts on the 400-gig Ethernet switch opportunity. I think there might be some confusion about the opportunity as it relates to timing, given the limited availability of the optics going into the switches. It sounds like that market is beginning without the optics. If you could maybe help us understand how to think about the trajectory there? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. So you are right. I think, the market opportunity for the 400-gig capable product starts before the availability of 400-gig optics, primarily because many of these products are actually, in fact, capable of supporting both 100-gig denser 100-gig configurations, as well as 400-gig. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our first set of platforms, a custom silicon-based platform and a merchant silicon-based platform, both of which support dense 400-gig, but even denser 100-gig configurations. Those are now being tested by our customers and we are essentially competing for net new footprint. The ramps in terms of meaningful revenue contribution really won\u2019t start until the 400-gig optics become available. I expect that to happen in first-half to middle of next year. And then keep in mind that we do have an investment that\u2019s happening in the silicon photonics space that enables us to become masters of our own destiny in terms of providing the types of 400-gig optics, which we believe will have superior economic value propositions in order to support our 400-gig systems and software roadmap that will see light of day over the next couple of quarters. Simon Leopold : Yes. So that was actually \u2013 my follow-up is, if you could give us an update on the silicon photonics efforts, given last quarter, you had talked about not focusing on 100, so that you could put your energy into a 400-gig product. I\u2019d appreciate just an update of the progress and timeline for availability of 400-gig optics from Juniper? Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly. So you\u2019re right. We explained, described a change in strategy around our silicon photonics effort. We were primarily using 100-gig as a way to learn. As you know, this is a new area of of innovation for us, and there are always going to be lessons learned whenever you\u2019re sort of charting new territory. We have diverted focus on the 400-gig. The lessons that we\u2019ve learned in the 100-gig effort have already been applied to our 400-gig effort. I remain optimistic about the opportunity and our ability to introduce into the market 400-gig optics in the first-half of next year, which will be perfectly timed with what we believe to be the ramp within our customers for 400-gig networks. I do think that we\u2019ll have optics that will have a superior economic value proposition, superior power profile that is obviously very meaningful to all of our customers, but especially our cloud customers. There is still some risk, because again, this is a new innovation area for us. But with every passing month and the lessons that we\u2019ve learned, I believe that we have mitigated \u2013 we\u2019re mitigating more and more of the risk. So at this point, I\u2019m quite optimistic of our ability to deliver on the roadmap. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Kvaal : Thank you very much. I would love to dial into that 400-gig in cloud overlap a little bit more. It sounds like you are shipping some of these items, and it seems as though cloud is going well. Are you suggesting that you\u2019ve actually won some 400-gig footprint now, or are these shipments primarily going into trials for the moment? Rami Rahim : We are primarily in the trial phase of the 400-gig cycle right now. So in some cases, those are in labs, in some cases, we\u2019ve actually seen some very early sort of limited production type of testing that is happening. And this is the time in which we engage with our customers to make sure that we\u2019re tucked and tied across the entire innovation stack from our new software capabilities and with our cloud-oriented Junos software that we\u2019ve now introduced into the market and the new systems, and it\u2019s looking good. It\u2019s still early days, but I have to say that the feedback from our customers is very encouraging. We still got a lot of execution ahead of us. But based on what we\u2019ve seen from a competitive standpoint, the products that have been in the roadmap for sometime, the feedback that we\u2019re getting from our customers, the early testing that we\u2019re doing, I think we\u2019re in good shape to be able to take some net new footprint, which has always been the strategy. Ken Miller : Yes, and just to clarify, the Q2 results in cloud had very little impact with 400-gig. We are starting to ship getting into trials, getting into testing labs, et cetera. But the revenue that we posted in Q2 was really more of our typical revenue pairs [ph] we have from the cloud vertical, not 400-gig-related. Jeffrey Kvaal : Okay. That makes sense, Ken. Thank you. How long do you think it will be before some of these items actually make it out of production testing into actual shipments that you would then be able to talk about with us? Rami Rahim : I think that the volume shipments will largely be based on the availability of 400-gig optics, which is in the first-half of next year. The activities are happening now and the awards are going to happen over the next couple of quarters. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re absolutely focused on right now is essentially proving ourselves, so that we can get a real crack at net new footprints. And as I mentioned, I think, we\u2019re in good shape to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roy, UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roy : Great, thank you. Rami, you obviously are very optimistic about the back-half. I wonder if you could give us a little more color on what of the number of things you see happening in the back-half are really giving you the confidence maybe in rank order? It\u2019d be good, if you could give us, helpful? Rami Rahim : Certainly, John. So I think there are a number of factors. First is just the timing of build-outs among our customers, especially in the service provider space, where we have visibility into some projects that are happening in the back-half that will contribute to the momentum in that vertical. I do think if you see our performance in the enterprise, exiting the first-half of the year, where we build some good backlog, I think, that momentum is solid and will certainly contribute to the second-half. The investments that we have been making in the sales organization where we have undertaken a fairly significant and somewhat difficult transformation, the hard work of the transformation effort is now behind us. And it really is now around investing in net new quota-carrying sales or reps that will take time to become productive. And I think by the time we get to the sort of Q4 timeframe and into next year, certainly, I do believe that they will contribute meaningfully to our momentum all up. I will also add the innovation cycle. So we\u2019ve announced a number of new products and, in fact, introduced a number of products into the market. So the MX 5G, for example, net new line cards that triple the performance and capacity of those platforms, those are now in customer trials. They\u2019re being tested. And I think that will start to contribute in the second-half of the year. Mist, our software efforts around enterprise, multi-cloud connectivity will start to payoff increasingly near the second-half of the year. The last thing I will mention is just about forecasting rigor, which has been a real focus of ours as a function of this sales transformation effort. We\u2019ve really added more emphasis on our ability to improve forecasting and predictability. And so all of these factors together, I think, is what\u2019s contributing to the confidence we have in the second-half of the year. John Roy : Great. It\u2019s very helpful. And one other final question, you were talking about you\u2019re holding your share, or at least your footprint you think in the cloud. Are you seeing any other share changes in any of the other areas? Obviously, you expect share gains in the back-half, I would think. But could you give us any color on the quarter\u2019s possible share changes? Rami Rahim : Well, you\u2019re right. We believe that the strategy that we have been embarking on of proactively taking our customers from the MX product line to the PTX product line in areas where it makes sense to do so has achieved the net goal that we were after, which is to maintain that footprint. We don\u2019t believe that we have been displaced from any of the networks where we have that strength. I think the next opportunity for share shift will happen in the 400-gig cycle. And that just goes back to the commentary I just provided around the trial, the proof-of-concept testing that is happening right now. The words that I believe will start to happen over the next couple of quarters. And then ultimately, the deployments that will result in potential share shift from a revenue standpoint in the first-half and sort of middle of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Yun, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Yun : Hey, guys. I just had a question on 400-gig and the optics as well, particularly as it relates to your go-to-market. So I know you highlighted sort of like the engineered partnerships with some of the large cloud \u2013 to large cloud guys and building the custom silicon. But with Cisco\u2019s kind of intent to purchase Acacia, does that change any of the competitive dynamics in 400-gig? Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. On your question about Acacia, Acacia is a relatively small technology provider for us. So I don\u2019t expect that to impact us in anyway than there are alternative sources for the kinds of products that we were buying from Acacia. From a 400-gig cycle and go-to-market, the first customers that will consume 400-gig, we believe will be the cloud providers and that will be followed up by the service providers. In the cloud space, we have everything we need from a go-to-market standpoint. And you\u2019re right, there is the sales effort that we put into our cloud provider vertical, but just as importantly is the engineering effort. In fact, often our best sales people in the cloud vertical are our engineers that are developing the software, the systems, the optics that ultimately make their way into those networks. That engagement model is something that we\u2019re very comfortable with. We\u2019re very used to because of the strengths that we hold in the routing space. We\u2019re just now extending that sales model and the engineering engagements across new footprint. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to revisit the question of second-half drivers, I guess, in the context of the service provider vertical being so weak this quarter. And then what I keep hearing you guys say, I got this service providers, kind of at the top end of the list of drivers. I think you said that last quarter as well. And so, can you just juxtapose those two things for us and let us know kind of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of visibility and is \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing this quarter kind of consistent with what you had expected to see? And then I have a follow-up? Rami Rahim : Yes. Sure, Rod. So in the service provider vertical, I think, it\u2019s more of the same in terms of market dynamics that we have been calling out now for a number of quarters. The service \u2013 many of our service provider customers are under business model challenges. And as a result of that, there\u2019s consolidation. There are all sorts of distractions. There\u2019s also investment priorities around RAN and spectrum purchases and so forth that we have anticipated will impact this part of our business for sometime. There are sort of catalysts and even some green shoots that I do think will play out over the next few years around 5G, around our partnership effort with Ericsson, around our telco cloud momentum that we are seeing in the market, some of the portfolio enhancements that we\u2019re making around the metro and mobile backhaul, which is very much aligned with the 5G growth. So I \u2013 we still expect that service provider all up for 2019 is going to be down on a year-over-year basis. What we\u2019re calling out is, if I \u2013 if we take a look at the pipeline, the specific opportunities that we see in front of us, the second-half of the year will be better than the first-half of the year. That\u2019s really the extent of the commentary that we\u2019ve made around the remainder of this year. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you, Rami. I appreciate that. And then, Ken, I just had modeling question, the days payable jumped down a lot and I know you\u2019ve made a comment in the prepared remarks. But could you just revisit that comment and maybe go into a little bit more detail about why days payable was such a big change for the quarter? Rami Rahim : Yes. So it really just has to do with the timing and how we\u2019ve landed in a quarter. There was nothing intentional about the timing from our payable side. It\u2019s just the way that \u2013 our invoicing from our contract manufacturers, in particular, worked out. It resulted in a little more cash went out the door than expense. I expect that to kind of recover in the future quarter \u2013 in this quarter in Q3. Rod Hall : Is that affected by the tariffs at all, Ken, or is it just kind of a random event that\u2026 Ken Miller : No. Rod Hall : \u2026doesn\u2019t relate to anything that we would see happening out there? Ken Miller : Yes. Rod Hall : Okay. Ken Miller : I really would \u2013 I really call it a random, but then it has no impact from the tariffs. Rod Hall : Okay, great. I appreciate that. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : This is Meta Marshall from \u2013 for James. Quick question. Just stepping back on tariffs, you noted the changes that you had made to kind of largely mitigate the impact, but that there would be kind of an ongoing impact in the second-half. And so can you just walk through whether production is being moved or whether there would be kind of a remaining ongoing impact that we should model unless the trade agreement is reached? And then, maybe just following-up on that. Is \u2013 what is kind of the ability to pass on a price change? And what have you found as an ability to do so? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. From a tariff, the primary mitigation efforts have revolved around really changing where our manufacturing is being completed as an interest into the U.S. So we have a global footprint. As you know, we manufacture within China. We manufacture in other parts of Asia, which are non-tariff and we also manufacture in parts of North America, Mexico and U.S. So we have opportunity to move most of the production to other locations that was primarily done in China previously. And that\u2019s really resulted us mitigating the vast majority. That said, we\u2019re not able \u2013 we are not \u2013 we\u2019ve chosen not to move all production out of China, so there are still some products that we still manufacturer only in China. And as always going to the U.S., we are seeing a tariff. It\u2019s, again, it\u2019s the minority of our total tariff exposure, if you were to go back, say, a year ago before tariffs, because we\u2019ve been able to offset most of it. That 30 to 50 basis point impact that I\u2019m talking about is really a difference between a 10% and a 25% tariff. So there is \u2013 we still expect to be a tariff in the second-half. In addition to the actual cost of tariff, we know some of the mitigation efforts by moving manufacturing from location to different locations has resulted in overall slight uptick in our cost of goods sold really as part of the mitigation. So there is some costs associated with that as well. We are passing along some of that tariff increase to our customers. We\u2019ve been fairly successful of doing that. But there have been some situations where we haven\u2019t been able to pass all the cost through, which is why we are seeing some impact to our gross margin. Meta Marshall : Got it. And so would you kind of \u2013 if there were a trade agreement reach tomorrow, would that go away, because you would move that production back, or like how should we just consider the timing of how long the 30 to 50 basis point impact would kind of impact margins? Rami Rahim : Yes, I think we would get a benefit of hover an agreement tomorrow to eliminate the tariff. I don\u2019t think we would get back to our previous cost of goods sold, because I do not believe we would move manufacturing back into China. We would likely keep it where it currently is, which is \u2013 has a slight impact, but much less than the actual cost of the tariff. So we would see a benefit if the tariff would be eliminated. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with a question on the Wi-Fi upgrades, the cycle that you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in the prepared remarks. As you\u2019re talking to customers about the Wi-Fi 6, upcoming cycle around Wi-Fi 6, I know we have kind of earlier to that cycle. But are you getting a sense that customers are willing to upgrade to the Wi-Fi 6 product? And as you\u2019re looking at kind of campus switching and Wi-Fi 6 together, should we think about it as a kind of a combined product cycle, or are customers thinking about it independently in terms of an upgrade? Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question, Samik. So I do think it\u2019s still early days, but Wi-Fi 6 is going to be a pretty significant growth driver for us in the campus and branch segment. The first Mist Systems Wi-Fi 6 products are actually now shipping, and we even have a few early deployments with some of our high-end enterprise customers that are starting to leverage that technology. To your question around whether is standalone or more combined, it\u2019s all of the above. There are customers that have decoupled buying cycles between wireless LAN and wired technology. And in those customers, we\u2019ll certainly \u2013 we\u2019ll sell them the technology that they want. But with every customer that buys wireless LAN from us, there is an opportunity to either attach immediately, or at some point in the future through the fact that we\u2019ve now created a channel into that customer and built the relationships with the IT team to sell them additional technology, whether it be wired or security, or SD-WAN, as an example. So that synergy based on the early days of the integration with Mist is becoming more and more of a reality for us and we\u2019re proving out the thesis that we had. I just also just want to point out, in order to realize the full potential of the AX standard, which typically add some level of complexity to a network, you really need to have the kind of cloud managed AI engine that Mist Systems brings to the table that I\u2019m now seeing firsthand how valuable it is for our customers. It simplifies not only the deployment, but it also simplifies the ongoing operations of a wired wireless LAN network and many of our customers are absolutely loving it. And I think that can be extended \u2013 that experience can be extended to other parts of our portfolio as well. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. If I could clarify on the cloud revenue that you had, you had a strong sequential growth this quarter. But you\u2019re kind of guiding to a sequential decline next quarter that does suggest that they might have been some exceptional pull forward of revenues this quarter. So just want to clarify if revenues from the cloud side did come in better because of some pull forward from 3Q that\u2019s what you saw? Rami Rahim : No, I don\u2019t believe this because of a pull forward. I think if you take a look at our cloud business over the last couple of years, we\u2019re sort of seeing a bit of a cyclicality that\u2019s happening throughout the year, where Q2 tends to be a little quite strong just based on the timing of deployments and seeing a bit of moderation on a sequential basis is not anything that I\u2019m really concerned about. We\u2019re going to see some ebbs and flows in this business based on timing of deployments. But the Meta points for cloud is that the really hard transition is now behind us. We\u2019re now at a point in a very unique position in terms of the footprint that we enjoy in the cloud routing space. We will see a recovery in that business, a continued recovery based on the continued investments that our big cloud customers are making in the routing segment. And, of course, then that focus that we have on net new segments, especially in our net new technology areas and footprint, especially in switching. Operator : Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. George Notter : Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Ken, maybe first one for you on the tax rate. 19.5%, I think is a certainly a bump up from the kinds of tax rates, I think, we talked about in the past. I guess, I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s really changing there? And then for Rami, I guess, I\u2019m inferring from the conversation here that the service provider routing business really took a big step down in Q2. Your cloud business overall was flat year-on-year. We know that business is really heavily centered on routing, and yet the routing business was down 15% year-on-year. So I guess, again, I\u2019m inferring that the difference there is service provider routing. Is that a hold up from customers waiting for the MX 5G line cards, or is there something else going on in service provider routing? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Let me start and then, Ken, why don\u2019t you jump in on the question around with a tax rate. In the service provider space, which is largely determined by our routing technology, it really is just much of the business model challenges and the macro challenges, the challenges around service providers, as well as their focus on areas of investments that are outside of routing. Beyond that, I do think that, we\u2019re in a mode right now where our traditional customers in the service provider space, especially Tier 1 customers in North America, are in and of themselves, not going to be enough for us to achieve growth in this vertical. So there is a very concerted effort within the company right now to build net new footprint, especially in International Service Provider account. So that\u2019s going to take a number of quarters to build out. But that\u2019s the thing that we need to do internally in order to sort of recover this \u2013 that routing and in particular routing in the SP space. That\u2019s kind of the bulk of what\u2019s happening in routing for us. Ken Miller : On tax rate front, there\u2019s really a couple of things if you really want to kind of reconcile to, say, last year\u2019s rate, one would be the discrete items. Last year, we had some kind of discrete items that positively impacted our tax rate, which is why it was lower last year. This year, those discrete items are actually going the other direction slightly. And also really, it\u2019s the international mix of earnings is a big factor on attach rate as well. So that also resulted in the rate being 19.5% for Q2. Now I\u2019m trying to take some of that volatility out going forward by fixing the rate for the rest of the year on a non-GAAP basis at 19.5%. And the plan would be to, as we enter into next year, we\u2019ll have a fixed rate for the full-year next year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Sure. Thank you. Regarding the software percentage of total revenue, the 10%, was the fair majority of that security revenues? Because there was a bit of an uptick in security and maybe you could just give me more color on that side? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sami. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just security, but certainly there is an element of it that\u2019s tied to security because out of all of our technology areas, the software attach rate for security has traditionally been the strongest. The momentum we\u2019re seeing in software is the combination of on-box software. So software that\u2019s attached to systems, security, switching and routing that\u2019s either way into our customers networks, and also the off-box software with things like the cloud management and AI solution for Mist or Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud solution for the data center or for telco cloud. It\u2019s that combination. There is a real strategy that we\u2019re executing internally to increase software, the percentage of revenue. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made. I think we are on track to achieve the objective of 16% software as a component of total revenue in the 2021 timeframe. And I think that the roadmap and the business models around those roadmaps that we have, we are introducing it to the market allow us to continue to see this momentum. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. And then the \u2013 my next question has to do with the major customer that you called out approximately 10% or more of total revenues and I\u2019m sure if you said more approximately. But did this customer spend or consume products across multiple segments, or was it predominantly just routing or switch, or switching? Maybe just give me an idea on what exactly the buying patterns are when these big customers come to you? Rami Rahim : Yes. So we mentioned this is a customer that is in our cloud vertical and the technology areas are routing and switching, mostly. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Rami, you spoke quite positively about enterprise for the September or Q3 quarter. Looking at the results for this quarter, it looks like it was down year-over-year, I think it was about 6% or so you said or mentioned. Was there some delays or push outs to Q3? Or can you help us understand your confidence or why a challenge June quarter and then a quite positive outlook for the September quarter for the Enterprise segment? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jim. So we saw double-digit, in fact, 12% year-over-year growth in bookings in the enterprise vertical and even stronger sequential growth in bookings for the Q2 period in the enterprise space. That was fueled by a number of different factors. We had strength in the U.S. government, and I believe that is going to be a good vertical for us going forward. But we also have real strength in the technologies that we\u2019re now introducing to the market that are giving us some real differentiation. I mentioned the campus and branch. SD-WAN is an area where we have been investing in and putting focus in over the last couple of years, that now is starting to become a contributor to our performance, where we\u2019re seeing a very healthy pipeline. We\u2019re seeing both accounts that we\u2019re winning with a direct enterprise model, as well as leveraging our service providers as a channel into net new enterprise footprints. All of this is leading to the confidence that we have in the second-half of the year. Ken, you might want to talk a little bit about the difference between the revenue performance and bookings performance for the quarter? Ken Miller : Sure. So as Rami mentioned, bookings were up double digits. Revenue, as you mentioned, Jim, was down 6%. That\u2019s really a result of this \u2013 the deployments that our customers wanted there for our shipments into those orders. Linearity on the bookings perspective was actually quite normal. So we didn\u2019t have a back-end in quarter or anything like that from bookings perspective. However, the way the shipments laid out, it resulted in the results that we have, and therefore, backlog went up in Q2. Our enterprise focus backlog went up, which gives us more confidence about Q3. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details. That\u2019s greatly appreciates. Rami Rahim : Sure. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Genovese, MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question. Michael Genovese : Great. Thanks very much. Hey, Rami, I\u2019m thinking about the verticals that Juniper competes in and they go through them in service provider. I see a company that reported this morning, just released a new product and had pretty strong results in that segment. I\u2019m claiming to take a lot of share. In the cloud vertical, there\u2019s a competitor reporting next week who has consistently outperformed for years here versus [indiscernible]. And then in enterprise, you\u2019re kind of a point solution versus a much broader vendor. So I\u2019m just sort of struggling, I\u2019m sorry to put it this way. But I\u2019m struggling to sort of think where is Juniper the best at. Like what technology, what market, what vertical are you bringing a unique \u2013 I mean, I know you bring differentiation? But where is it really taking hold? And where should I look for Juniper to really show some leadership in the market and gain some share over the next year? Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the question. There\u2019s a lot to unpack there, but let me try. In the cloud space, we have a very unique position in cloud routing, a position that we have built over a number of years, where that strength in terms of the footprint that we hold has remained as a result of a very deliberate strategy to ensure that our customers have the very best technology in order to build out what is networks that carry a huge amount of traffic. That strength is really unique to Juniper. We have substantial market share. And the path forward is one, where we leverage that footprint to continue to grow in that vertical based on timing of deployment, but also the ability to grow into net new footprint, which we have a real opportunity to do so, especially with the 400-gig cycle that\u2019s coming. In the enterprise. I would respectfully disagree with the notion that Juniper is a point player. In fact, we\u2019re one of only two vendors in the market that has a full portfolio in the campus and branch that extends wired and wireless, as well as SD-WAN to provide our customers with an end-to-end solution that\u2019s, in fact, embedded in security that is actually working in the markets. The momentum that we\u2019re seeing in the market is not by accident, it\u2019s very much a function of the fact that this is an area we focused in from a technology standpoint and from a sales standpoint. And then there\u2019s the data center side, where we have some unique differentiation there as well, in terms of the software and the hardware capabilities. In the SP space, I think there is a market dynamic that people need to understand. If you\u2019re going to compare us to others in the industry, you really have to look at this across a number of different areas. First, our strength has traditionally been more in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, I believe some of the bigger build-outs now are happening more internationally and we need to tap into that. And we do that through great partnerships, but also by betting on go-to-market for net new footprint, which is in the process of happening right now. Secondarily, it\u2019s around sort of where are our technology strength lies. Today, it\u2019s mostly in the core, in the edge and the metro. I believe that there are build-outs happening internationally that are more in the access mobile backhaul space, where our portfolio is still now sort of coming together. So as that comes together, we\u2019ll be able to leverage the strength and the relationships we have with a number of customers to see a rebuilding of momentum in the SP space. That\u2019s how I would characterize the strength we have, but as well as the opportunity that we have across the different verticals. Michael Genovese : Well, that\u2019s a very good answer to a tough question. Thank you. Rami Rahim : You bet. My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I was hoping you could parse your switching performance between data center and campus in 2Q and what you see from an orders perspective, looking forward? Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly. So, in the switching space, I saw, I think, we saw a meaningful sequential recovery off of a tough Q1. We still have ways to go and a lot of opportunity ahead of us in the switching space. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s sort of equally split roughly more or less between the campus and the data center environment. We\u2019re certainly seeing some momentum in the campus space because of the fact that we\u2019ve now plugged what was a gap in our portfolio and wireless LAN. In the data center, I think that our differentiation and our ability to penetrate net new footprints and to reaccelerate that portion of our business comes down to a couple of different things. There\u2019s the hyperscalar opportunity with 400-gig, which is obviously very important in a key area focus. But then in the enterprise, it\u2019s \u2013 getting the enterprise multi-cloud software solution that simplifies the deployments and the ongoing operations of data center build-outs in the enterprise that I think is going to help. Now we\u2019ve introduced the first version of that solution, that software solution just recently. We\u2019re in the mode of making sort of a very rapid enhancements that are based on specific customer feedback that we are getting. And I think as we get into the back-half of the year, it\u2019s going to contribute and going to help us in the data center portion of our switching business. Ken Miller : The only thing I would add to that is both our QFX product line, which is predominantly focused on data center and our EX, which is focused on the campus and branch, both grew sequentially. So we are seeing momentum across both sets of really switching platforms. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. And as a follow-up, you mentioned, Rami, earlier that some of the bigger service provider deployments are happening internationally and that\u2019s not traditionally where your strength has been. I wonder if you could speak specifically about the EMEA region, other routing companies appear to have outperformed Juniper in EMEA over the last few quarters. And now you\u2019ve made leadership changes and so forth. We also have the Huawei dynamic. So talk to us a little bit about the EMEA region and your efforts there? Rami Rahim : Yes. The EMEA region, of course, is a huge region that includes Western Europe, where we have a real strength in a number of specific accounts, Tier 1 operators, in particular. It also includes a number of emerging markets, Middle East and Africa, et cetera, where we\u2019re still relatively a small player, but where we do see some real opportunity to grow the business. In fact, that is a big area of focus in net new accounts where we traditionally have not had a lot of presence and strength. So that is definitely a big part of the focus I just mentioned to expand into net new opportunities. Yes, outside of the U.S. where we have traditionally been strong, also outside of just Western Europe, which has been a driver of our EMEA performance historically, I think, we can sort of add fuel to that with more of the emerging market opportunities that I believe exist ahead of us. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Before we conclude the call, we would like to make everyone aware that we will be hosting an AI for Enterprise TED Talk on August 14. We will also be participating in sell-side conferences hosted by Oppenheimer, Jefferies, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank this quarter. Additional details regarding our participation in these events will be available on our IR website. We look forward to meeting and speaking with many of you during the quarter. That concludes today\u2019s call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported mixed results during the September quarter. Total revenue of $1.133 billion was slightly below midpoint of our guidance due to weaker than expected trends within our service provider business. Challenges within this vertical more than offset healthy cloud and enterprise sales, both of which grew year-over-year. Non-GAAP, earnings per share of $0.48 came in $0.02 above the midpoint of our forecast as better than expected non-GAAP gross margins and strong cost controls more than offset the impact from our incremental China tariffs. While we remain on track to deliver a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter, we are now expecting a lower level of growth than we previously anticipated. The change versus our prior expectations reflects our belief that the Service Provider weakness we experienced over the last few quarters is likely to continue and that our enterprise momentum will moderate from recent levels based on the order trends we experienced this past quarter. We believe these dynamics will more than offset the improved momentum we're seeing with our cloud customers. We believe we are executing well in a dynamic environment. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of our business, and we are investing to win in each of our core markets, many of which are expected to undergo material technology transitions over the next few years. Typically, transitions present opportunities to gain share and we believe we have the right products, strategy, and go-to-market motions needed to capitalize on the 5G, 400 gig enterprise multicloud, and WiFi 6 opportunities that are likely to play-out over the next several years. Given our conviction in our prospects and belief that the innovations we are bringing to market should position us to drive a sustainable return to modest growth starting next year, our board has increased our buyback authorization by $1 billion, and we intend to enter into a $200 million ASR this quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some insight into the September quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with the positive, we experienced a second consecutive quarter of improved trends within our cloud business during the September quarter, which grew 6% year-over-year as we continue to see momentum within our customers\u2019 wide area network, particularly from some of our Switching Products this past quarter. Order trends remained healthy and we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business year-over-year during the December quarter. We're encouraged by the success we are seeing within our cloud customers\u2019 wide area network and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements in this segment now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities, where historically we have maintained limited share. On this last point, we've started to deliver the systems, silicon, and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle, and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. We have started to introduce these solutions into our customers\u2019 labs and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins or even a modest level of success could present material tailwind for our business in the years to come. Within our service provider vertical, we experienced weaker than expected trends during the September quarter with this business declining 17% year-over-year due to ongoing challenges many of our carrier customers are facing. While our carrier relationships remain strong, we did see a number of expected projects push out of the quarter as many of these customers are choosing to run their networks harder, some are capital constrained, and others have shifted resources to spectrum licenses and RAN build-outs. Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience sequential growth during the December quarter and see more modest year-over-year declines in 2020. The move of our MX 5G line cards from qualification to deployment, the success of our Contrail Telco Cloud platform, and the availability of new access products are some of the reasons we expect our Service Provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods. While we reported very healthy enterprise revenue during Q3 with this business growing 8% year-over-year, we saw a deceleration in orders toward the end of the period that is leading us to moderate our enterprise expectations for the remainder of the year. We believe this deceleration was due to lingering effects associated with the sales transformation actions we took earlier in the year and macro related weakening in the customer spending environment. Despite these dynamics, we are seeing some pockets of strengths within our enterprise business that are providing optimism and longer-term prospects for this business. First, our QFX switching business experienced growth both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. QFX orders grew 20% year-over-year driven by improved demand within the cloud as well as enterprise datacenter market. We believe our industry leading EVPN-VXLAN capabilities and Contrail fabric management software are resonating in the datacenter market and should position us to grow this business moving forward. Second, I'm pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader Enterprise market. While the numbers remain small, the momentum we are seeing is real, and I am increasingly convinced that Mist and the associated pull through it enables should become a material driver for Juniper in 2020. To this point, Mist customer base has grown 42% since we closed the deal and doubled year-over-year; two proof points of the momentum we are seeing. It's also worth mentioning we secured over 100 new Mist customer proof-of-concepts in just this past quarter, more than 80% of which included an EX or SRX opportunity. We believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist potential and we are investing to further monetize our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to WiFi 6 and the AI driven enterprise. The WiFi 6 refresh and Mist differentiator architecture is already enabling us to win wireless and wired opportunities we previously were unable to address and should present further tailwind in the year to come. Third, our SD-WAN capabilities are starting to see healthy traction in the market. While this opportunity remains in the very early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security, and WiFi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is likely to be a large and fast growing market, but it also presents another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio. I think it's important to highlight that our security business is continuing to see strength with this business growing 22% year-over-year in the September quarter, driven by strength at the high-end and mid-range of our portfolio. While we do not expect our security business to sustain the level of growth we experienced in Q3, we are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing and the success of our secured networking strategy which focuses on bundling security with our networking platforms across several customer use cases. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. We're also continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 13% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10% of revenue during the September quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 100% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 200% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially a subscription based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Before I turn it over to Ken, I'd like to touch upon where we are with our sales transformation efforts which were set into motion under the leadership of Marcus Jewell earlier this year. The goal of these initiatives is to drive improved sales productivity by leveraging a more data-oriented approach, putting the right sales incentives into place to encourage the best behaviors and identifying areas of potential savings that could be reinvested into additional quota carrying sales teams. I firmly believe these actions will not only position us to grow on a sustainable basis, but also to take advantage of the innovations we are delivering across our portfolio to take share. However, with an organizational change of this magnitude, it is not uncommon to see an elevated level of turnover for a short period of time, which is something we encountered earlier this year. While this disruption was largely behind us exiting the June quarter and we have made solid progress versus our hiring goals year-to-date, we have not been able to fill our open positions as quickly as we would have liked and many of our newer sellers are now early in the process of ramping to productivity. The combination of which has slightly impacted the trajectory of our enterprise orders. This disruption along with the emergence of some macro related caution has caused us to expect a slightly more conservative enterprise revenue outlook for the December quarter. Longer term, I believe the investments we are making in our go-to-market organization along with the products and innovations we're bringing to market are the right ones and should position us to deliver a return to modest growth next year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Our third quarter results were mixed with total revenue of $1.133 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially but slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% was 1.1 points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. This strength was driven by favorable deal mix and improved inventory management. Gross margin strength as well as prudent operating expense management drove the non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud increased 6% and we are pleased with the return to growth in this vertical. While Enterprise revenue increased 8% year-over-year, we did see some weakness in bookings towards the end of the quarter. Finally, Service Provider declined 17% year-over-year, which was weaker than expected. On a sequential basis, Enterprise increased 10%; Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud was down 5%. From a technology perspective, Switching increased 9%, Security increased 22% while Routing decreased 18% year-over-year. Software revenue continued to grow, increasing 13% year-over-year and was approximately 10% of total revenue. Our services business increased 1% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $129 million, down 3% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Looking at our balance sheet, total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $185 million for the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower payments to suppliers and lower cash tax payments, partially offset by higher payments related to variable compensation. I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our revenue outlook shows a modest return to year-over-year growth at the midpoint. However, it is lower than previously expected due to continued business challenges as some of our largest Service Provider customers, lingering impacts from our sales force transformation and macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain confident in our position in the markets we serve, and in our relationships with our customers. Our fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP gross margin guidance reflects the recent increase in China tariffs, which is offset partially by the expected increase in revenue. We continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin. These efforts include value engineering, optimizing our supply chain and service business, pricing management and increased software and solution sales. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated reduction in India's corporate tax rate. Despite the lower than expected revenue outlook, we continue to manage costs prudently, and still expect to achieve the low-end of our $1.70 to $1.80 earnings range for the full-year 2019. As Rami mentioned, our board of directors has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, which brings our current authorization to $1.9 billion. In addition, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to be opportunistic on future capital returns. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, gentlemen. I guess, I would love Rami if you would spend a little bit more time adding some color to your commentary about starting to deliver software and silicon into some hyperscale for testing. What does that mean in terms of how deep in the process you are with them? What are some of the milestones and timing that we can look for over the next quarter or so? Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Jeff. So first, as a bit of a context here, I'm pleased with the results in the cloud provider space in the Q3 timeframe. It is in no little part due to the really amazing efforts of the engineering team, our sales team, and what is essentially a pretty impactful product transition from MX to PTX. The net of it is now we're in a position where we have retained the footprint that honestly leaves Juniper in a very unique position in terms of share in the routing space. Now that allows us to grow with the capacity requirements of our cloud provider customers, and it also allows us to focus on net new footprint, in particular around 400 gig. And the 400 gig opportunity will initially be in the data center interconnect and the data center switching opportunity, and will eventually expand to more use cases. From a technology standpoint, we've already released into the market the new Junos operating system that has been designed very purposefully for the cloud provider space. So, it has all of the capabilities, the Linux-native capabilities, modularity, the programmability, the telemetry aspects of what we know our cloud providers need and want. We also have our very first systems based both on merchant silicon and custom silicon offerings that run that operating system and there will be more to come. So, we're working on a roadmap of different systems with different capacities that will be delivered over the next couple of quarters. In terms of the engagement with our customers, it's very strong. We have the initial proof-of-concepts that are already in flight right now. We are not confused about the fact that it's going to be a very competitive space because the opportunities are lucrative, but I think that we are well positioned to gain more than our fair share. And even a small share take in this space would be quite meaningful in terms of the tailwinds it will give us starting next year. Time wise, I expect that the initial deployments for 400 gig will be in the second half of next year, and that's very much time to the availability of 400 gig optics. And I just remind you that that includes both the third-party 400 gig optics, but also Juniper\u2019s own 400 gig optics through our silicon-photonics project that is currently underway. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Super. And then, Ken, perhaps a clarification, you talked about modest growth starting next year. How does that compare to the modest growth in the fourth quarter and how should we think about that over the course of the year? Thank you. Ken Miller : Yes, thanks Jeff. So while we remain opportunistic about our long-term growth prospects, and we are going to be looking for growth in 2020, I do think it's important to note that we are seeing some additional surge about a weakness and some macroeconomic uncertainties. Therefore, I really would caution you to be, conservative with your models, and we'll provide more detail later on 2020, but flat-to-low, single-digit growth would be a good way to think about 2020 at this point in time given some of the uncertainties that we see out there in the markets that we serve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brian Yun : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned, weakening enterprise outlook. I was wondering if you could expand on what you're seeing there. Is this a Juniper-specific issue due to the enterprise transformation kind of sales force initiatives you detailed or are you also seeing a broader enterprise market environment? Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. First, I should say that we're really pleased with the revenue performance that we saw in the enterprise space in Q3 timeframe, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter growth across pretty much all technologies and geos. Real great strengths in Q3 in our federal business in particular helped the performance in the Enterprise space. We did mention that, yes, near the end of the quarter, we started to see some weakening of orders and there are really a couple of factors that have impacted the business and they're roughly equal in terms of the total impact. First is the sales transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the issue there is really around the fact that we have a lot of new sellers that are not quite as productive as sellers that have been in seat for quite some time. We haven't been able to fill the open wrecks that we created as a part of the transition as quickly as we would like. That of course, it resolved itself over time. And in fact, I expect that to fully be beneficial to the business over the next few quarters. But in addition to that and separate to that, I do believe that there have been some overall macroeconomic factors that have impacted the timing of orders. So, what we saw are some of the opportunities that we were competing for took longer to close, some moved out into Q4 and into next year. And I'd say that that's a really a very orthogonal issue and one that's somewhat out of our control. We're going to focus on what we can control, which is really around getting through the sales transformation. The good news about that is the hard part, it is really behind us at this point and it is really around rebuilding and getting our new sellers as productive as possible in the shorter timeframe as possible. Brian Yun : Great. Thanks Rami. And Ken, maybe one for you, on gross margins, you outlined various margin improvement initiatives. Can you talk about which ones are more the immediate opportunities versus the longer-term opportunities? I'd imagine that increasing software sales that's more longer term, whereas supply chain optimization or pricing management that could be more near-term. Is that the right way to think about it? And if you could quantify any of those 2020 and beyond, that'd be helpful. Thank you. Ken Miller : Yes, I do think that\u2019s the right way to think about it as far as kind of what's been impacting us to date, pricing, supply chain management, obviously mitigating the tariffs have been a big focus over the last several quarters, and we've done a pretty good job on all those regards. Value engineering and design for value was longer term. However, I would say that we've been working on it for a few years, right. So, as we introduce new products this year and into next year and beyond, we are very focused on the cost of those products and really some of that will pay off over the long-term. So, at this point in time, all of the attributes are starting to benefit us because we are in a cycle where some products are coming to market that we started value engineering work a year or two ago. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe triangulate the disclosures you offer on products and verticals, specifically seeing a lot of strength in your security business, and strength in switching, coincident with strength in the enterprise vertical. And so I want to see if we can get a better understanding of what's specifically going on with enterprise customers since I think historically, many folks associate security with enterprise and switching with cloud. And I think it's probably much more nuanced, if you could double click on that topic. Rami Rahim : Happy to, Simon. So you're roughly right. There\u2019s a big element of security and switching that's tied to enterprise momentum at Juniper. But I think if you take a look at both of these technology areas, the strength is actually somewhat broad-based. So in switching, we saw strength in the enterprise, but we also saw strength in the cloud provider in particular, the hyperscale cloud provider space. In Security, I think we saw strength really all up across all of the verticals and it's very much, I think an artifacts of the technology that we're developing and solutions and use cases that we're addressing. So take for example, switching really it's around 100 gig. That's very interesting to the hyperscale space. It's also very interesting to large enterprises that are building out their own private data centers. We have implemented really world-class protocol technologies like EVPN-VXLAN on our 100 gig switches that make it well suited for, again, large enterprises that are building out their own data centers. It goes without saying, I'm really pleased with the performance that we saw in security. And again, broad base across SPs, cloud providers and enterprise up 22% year-over-year. There, the strength was mainly in areas where there is a combination of features that are required, efficacy of stopping attacks and also performance. So large enterprise, cloud providers, service providers that are securing mobile infrastructure, users, data, this is where we have some unique strengths that we are benefiting from right now in the security space. I would not expect this kind of performance in security on an ongoing basis. I think we benefit from a little bit of an easy compare in Q3 and the compare gets much more difficult, as you look into Q4. But nonetheless, I do have confidence in the trajectory of security across all our verticals going forward. Simon Leopold : Great. And one quick follow-up, you did in an earlier question indicate that you expected your optics products would be part of the availability ramp in the second half of 2020. And I am interpreting that comment to mean that you're on track and that your silicon-based photonics are going to be available around the turn of the calendar year, but your expectation is that they would be volume production in the second half of calendar 2020, am I understanding this correctly? Rami Rahim : We will introduce \u2013 our plan is to introduce 400 gig silicon-photonics based optics next year and with certainly in volume by the end of the year and sort of the specific milestones to get us there. We're not really ready to talk about that right now. The most important thing is to catch the beginning of the 400 gig wave. And I believe that we can do that. At this point, just to give you a bit more color on where we are. We have confidence in the technology because we proved it out in a lab environment. I think it's really going to be differentiated, but we still have work to do in terms of making it available and at scale. And in order to de-risk that, we have signed strategic partnerships with fab houses that are out there that specialized in taking technology like this and manufacturing it in volume. I would say that most of the risk is behind us, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us in order to get to the important ship dates next year. So in summary, I think if \u2013 when we deliver it should be really right at the sweet spot of the growth in 400 gig next year. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with a question, primarily around kind of Mist and I got few other comments that you had on the strength you are seeing with Mist Systems and we\u2019re hearing the same from customers that we are talking to. Just want to see what, how you're kind of thinking about the pull through of other products, particularly some of the campus switching portfolio with the strength you're seeing in Mist. Because I think last quarter when you spoke about Mist, you mentioned, you will have a separate specialist team for it. So do you need more integration or kind of more of those go-to-market motion to be able to drive more pull towards your other products with Mist? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So interest level in Mist is very high both from our customers and importantly from our own sales teams that are very excited about positioning and competing with the technology, I mentioned the proof points, the customer base for Mist has now grown by 40% since the close of the transaction. You're right that there is a significant opportunity to pull through additional Juniper products and that was part of the synergy thesis behind the acquisition that we've made. And thus far what we are seeing in many of the net new customers that we are winning. There is in fact a significant portion or opportunity of attached for both switching and security, in particular switching. So many people who look at Mist and think of it as primarily filling a wireless LAN gap in our portfolio are honestly missing the bigger picture, which is that Mist offers the framework of cloud management and analytics and AI that can simplify the job of a network operator and enhanced the end user experience. What we want to do now is expand that to include other portfolio \u2013 enterprise portfolio products in Juniper. The first of which will be EX. And we're seeing a very high level of interest from our customers from doing that and we're executing on that roadmap as we speak. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. I just want to follow up quickly on the 400 gig data center switching opportunities that you've talked about and you gave quite a bit of details on that already. I just wanted to understand, you mentioned you're trialing with both merchant silicone-based solution as well as the custom silicon solution. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about the rate of positioning of those products as well as the differentiation that you have? And which one do you think will be the preferred solution for the hyperscalers to go with? Rami Rahim : Yes, I appreciate the question. I should clarify that we don't see those products addressing the same use case. So we have chosen to use merchant silicon in certain parts of the network. For example, the access layers of a service provider or a cloud WAN deployment or the top of rack in \u2013 first level access and aggregation within a hyperscale network. The custom solutions that we're offering address more of a spine layer within the data center, data center interconnect, wide area deployments in the cloud provider space as well as the service provider space. So they're very much complimentary. To your question around differentiation, I feel very good. I think we have both the goods that are necessary in software with our new Junos evolved software that gives the modularity, the programmability, the telemetry capabilities that our customers need. It is the most modern operating system that's now out in the industry. And now couple that with the silicon offering that give I think an advantage to our customers in terms of price performance and honestly, the gravy on top it would be silicon-photonics once we introduced that capability into the market next year. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Tim Long : Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up if I could, first, Rami, could you just go back to the kind of the whole campus WiFi area obviously, Mist is off to a good start as a part of the portfolio here, but it seems to be a time, if you could talk a little bit about competition, obviously Cisco has a product cycle and HP seems to be reinvesting and Arista is trying to do a better job as well there. So just talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively there. And then the second one is on the Service Providers side, I mean you're not alone here seeing the weakness. In your view, what is it going to take to turn this business around more broadly, this vertical? Does it have to be 5G or is there something else that you see over the next several quarters that can maybe reverse the trend that we've seen across the SP markets? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Okay. For the questions, Tim. So first Mist, I think the level of differentiation that we have right now with Mist is truly unique compared to any competitive offerings that are out there. I think that the competitive advantage that we have is measured in the years, not less than that. And I truly do believe now having a much closer view of the technology as they are part of the Juniper family. That in order to achieve the kind of cloud-native management and AI capabilities that Mist offers, you have to start from scratch. You have to build a true cloud-native management solution from the beginning. And that's something that Mist started to do \u2013 the Mist team started to do years ago and now we are benefiting from that today. So I feel very confident about the differentiation, but more importantly the proof points of that confidence in terms of wins in the market and new opportunities, net new accounts is absolutely there. As we take that technology and extend it across other portfolio products, the most obvious one would be our EX campus wired switching portfolio. I think we will get additional lift in that area. On the Service Provider space, the business challenges that we're seeing right now are not new. We have been citing this now for a number of quarters and yes, you're right, our peer, they're also seeing some of these. I think that we're already dealing with limited budgets and flattish CapEx environment with SP customers and now what they're doing is reprioritizing investments so that \u2013 they're addressing spectrum and ran build out first. And that means that they have less to invest in IP. Having said that, there is a positive side to the story, which is that to the extent that 5G RAN and radio becomes a reality, access networks get built out. That means that there's more traffic that needs to be carried within the service provider, core and edge networks where we have strength. So, this is not something that I expect we will benefit from anytime soon. It's not going to be a next quarter thing. But I do believe that this will be a catalyst over time, measured in many quarters, that will help us benefits from net new investments in the SP space. Additionally, all telcos today are thinking about how they can change their networks and their operations to reap the efficiency and agility benefits of cloud. And we've got the premiere telco cloud software stack that's available in the market today with Contrail cloud. And we're seeing that evidenced by net new wins, which is great and encouraging, but it's early days to the extent that 5G deployments start to really get built out. And the services over 5G become virtualized. I think we benefit from that with the wins that we have at \u2013 we have had to-date. So these are a couple of factors that I think would be required in order to change the trajectory of our SP business. I do think next year the headwinds in SP will be less than what we have been experiencing this year. Tim Long : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to, I guess ask a couple of questions. One is on 400 gig and the proof-of-concept trial that you're involved in, could you say, are there any situations where other operating systems are being used on your switches or is it all Junos? And just talk us through kind of the operating system, competitive environment as well, is it the likely suspects, are there new OSs emerging, et cetera, just interested in that. And then secondly, wanted to go back to service providers, I know it's kind of be beaten up. And I, just a structural question on service providers, are you seeing any change in what types of routing ports people are buying? Like are you, are we seeing any structural changes here that are putting pressure on the service provider market or is it strictly, being delayed ahead of 5G and architectural decisions and things like that? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the questions Rod. On 400 gig, the question around other operating systems running on our hardware, no, I have not heard of that and I doubt that that's actually happening. More broadly for, I think your question was about sort of the competitive nature of the different software stacks that are available. And we've been working on our Junos Evolved software now for a number of years and we have done so with a very tight eye on and engagement with our cloud provider customers. So we've developed it to address the most pressing, requirements of our cloud customers, which gives me the confidence that, we've developed the right stack, that allows us to compete effectively in that space. In the service provider space, no, not really. I'm not seeing any sort of, I don\u2019t know, architectural or structural changes, as you know, we have the benefit of both these scale ups, like the traditional MX routing technology as well as scale-out with PTX and QFX. I would argue that we probably have the most experience right now among all of our peers in that transition from scale up to scale out because of what we have done with our hyperscale customers. But having said that, I would, I would just reiterate what I've said in the past that I do not see, a rapid transition from one architecture to another the way that we have seen it in the cloud space, and there are reasons for this. I mean, SP used cases, the services that they deliver tend to be more complicated. They're much more tied to the underlying networking infrastructure. And so whereas that transition might happen over time, I think it's going to be in a much longer timeframe than that we experienced in the cloud space. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Ittai Kidron : Hey guys, couple for me. First for you Rami on the hiring front, you've kind of mentioned that you're not clicking as fast as you do like on that front. Is this an HR issue or is this just a talent availability? It's just not out there. Is there no way to may perhaps repurpose some of your service provider people, it seems to be growing capacity there, maybe they can really repurpose. And then for Ken on the buyback front, great to see the expansion there. But why only 200 million? I guess I'm kind of wondering with the portfolio revolving and the opportunities seem to be gradually kind of working for you. Why not be more aggressive on the buy-back near term, or rather than just $200 million, it feels like there's more that you can do there near term. Rami Rahim : Thank you. So let me start on the hiring question. So, I would first point out that we are starting to see momentum in hiring. We have now, over a hundred new sales reps compared to just a quarter ago. So the ramp is really starting, and it's just not as fast as what we would like. And probably, the biggest reason for that is it's a competitive environment out there in terms of attracting and recruiting talent. But I think now with the energy and focus that we put on the problem, we will start to benefit from, being able to fill the open reps that are available. I also just want to point out that as important as hiring is getting our sales teams to full productivity as quickly as possible. And we have put in place, a really professional and robust enablement process at Juniper that\u2019s starting to work very effectively in our favor that will accelerate the time to productivity. So, more work to do, but I'm pleased with the direction that we're taking now and the speed that we're moving ahead. Ken Miller : Yes. And on the buyback front, I would just call out that we did $300 million in a Q2 ASR that just closed last quarter. In addition to that we did $50 million in Q3 at opportunistic purchases and we intend to enter into a $200 million, buy back soon. So that's $550 million this year, that plus our dividends is well over a 100% of our free cash flow. And I feel good about that. That said, we will continue to be opportunistic, right? We are announcing our intent to enter into a $200 million ASR. But we'll look to be opportunistic beyond that as we exit this year and into the next. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck guys. Ken Miller : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you all taking the questions. First off, Ken I feel bad for you? I don't think you said too much on this call. So, from a margin perspective, you've gotten back, I think, close is not exactly to where you were before the PTX to MX transition. Any visibility as to how much better you can do without the benefit of meaningful revenue growth and with the benefit of more meaningful, relatively speaking more meaningful revenue growth before I have a follow-up. Ken Miller : Yes, but don't feel bad, first of all, Paul. It's good to be here on the call. On a gross margin perspective, I would say, on a full year basis we're going to be about 60%. Right? So, although we had a strong Q3 and our guide for Q4 is also strong, full year base is about 60%. So we still have a ways to go to get to the high-end of our model of 58% to 62%. We're very focused on that over time. Volume will be the driver that said, so is product mix. So, making sure that our software solutions continue to grow as they have been for the last several quarters is a big part of the long-term gross margin profile. I am continuing being too focused on cost per byte, and margin management, pricing management, et cetera. So there is a lot of initiatives underway to help the company get to the higher end of that range but volume is definitely a driving factor. Paul Silverstein : All right. And Rami, a two part question here. One, how would you characterize the challenge in terms of the opportunity in breaking into the inch rod data center or leaf spine or perhaps core portion of web-scale relative to the risk of one of your competitors breaking into your bailey with your stronghold of wide area within that cloud customer base, what are the differences, what are the similarities, in terms of the risk relative to the opportunity? And the other question is if you would, can you give us any incremental insight on U.S. Enterprise and U.S. Service Provider in particular beyond the more general comments on the call, appreciate it. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the questions Paul. So, first it's good to understand our footprint in the hyperscale networks. We\u2019re very strong in the wide area and core networks. We are reasonably strong when it comes to data center interconnect and then we have relatively little, if any share in hyperscale leaf spine. We've got good deployments in sort of the tier two, tier three cloud providers switching but in hyperscale switching as it pertains to at leaf spine, they are a very limited footprint. If you look at where the initial opportunities are going to be for 400-gig, I expect them to be in the data center and in the data center interconnect where our penetration is not as strong as it is in the wide area and in the core market. The second part of your question around sort of the ease of which there is share shift in any one of these different layers. I\u2019d point out that, share shift is always more difficult, but it is easier when there is inflection point and 400 gig is such an inflection point. And I would also argue that the software capabilities in DCI and in the data center, they're not small by any means, but they're no where near as sophisticated from a routing scale functionality features, of the true core wide area deployments. So, I in no way want to make it sound like this is going to be an easy slam dunk. It's going to be an extremely competitive process. But I think we have the goods, the technology, the engagement model, the relationships that allow us to compete very effectively. And then I think the second question was around enterprise and SP as it pertains to the U.S. specifically. Today the trends in both of those areas are largely the same worldwide. In the service provider space, the challenges that are being felt by tier one SPs as they gear up towards 5G deployments are roughly the same internationally or certainly where we have a strength in the U.S. in Western Europe in some parts of Asia Pacific as well. And then the enterprise, I would say the same thing, which is that both factors are at play in terms of the macro economic outlook and the impact of that on spending, as well as our sales transformation, which is really a worldwide sales transformation. So that I don't think there's anything specific to the U.S. in both cases. Ken Miller : The only thing I would add is the U.S. Federal business is, is typically strong. In Q3 we had a very strong result in Q3. We typically see that go down in Q4 seasonally. That said, we do expect all up enterprise on a worldwide basis, to be up sequentially, despite the fact that U.S. Federal will likely be down. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. Two for me. First up on the Enterprise softness side, maybe I missed this, but could you quantify the weakness that you guys saw towards the end of the quarter, either in terms of the change in bookings trajectory or how much revenues do you think you left on the table towards end of the quarter. And then do you think you can pick up at least half of that, which might be attributed to Juniper specific dynamics? Rami Rahim : Yes, so on the Q3 results, from the revenue results, we actually didn't see the weakness, right? So there was nothing left on the table, if you will from a Q3 revenue perspective, the commentary is really more about guidance into Q4 and, we are off, $20 million to $40 million in total books, which is why we previously were in our Q4 guide. So, we're still guiding to modest growth, but it is down slightly from where we were before. The both, that delta is really split between Enterprise and an SP weakness. So we're talking, $10 million to $20 million range of kind of softness. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. And then that's helpful. Just follow-up with, when I think about calendar 2020 and the commentary around, flat to I think low single digit growth is what you guys have talked about? Can you just talk about what sort of trend line do you need the service provider business to be at for the overall company to have that kind of growth? Can you do this low single-digit growth, even if service providers are down mid-teens, or do you need a step-up there to achieve those overall calendar 2020 target? Ken Miller : Yes, so for next year we are really not prepared to talk about specific guidance. I do think overall we have a lot of opportunity to grow across many verticals, cloud and enterprise in particular and service provider. Rami already mentioned, we think we have an opportunity to lessen the decline, if you will. But how it's going to actually shake out next year, it's a little too early to call out at this point. I\u2019d just caution you to be got, I encourage you to be cautious just given some of the macro certainties the continued weakness. That's why I think flat to perhaps some slight growth next year is a good model at this point. Rami Rahim : Operator, we'll take two more questions. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Erik Lapinski : Hi team. You have Erik on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just to touch on the share repurchases and the increased authorization today, can you maybe walk us through the decision process on moving forward with share repurchases versus maybe maintaining extra dry power for acquisitions and given the success of Mist and if anything was attractive in the space? Ken Miller : Yes, it's a good question, Erik. I mean balance is very important. We clearly want to maintain our flexibility for future value enhancing M&A. At the same time, I think it's prudent to return capital to shareholders, particularly when we feel, it is an opportunistic time to do so. And that's kind of what we are now. We feel good about our prospects in the future and we still are going to maintain, well north of $2.5 billion, even post ASR, we\u2019ll grow cash in Q4 with cash flow from operations. So our cash balances remain very strong, as well, so that gives us opportunity to continue to be, as needed from an M&A front. Erik Lapinski : Thanks. And then maybe if I could just sneak in a second one, as you were mentioning actions to mitigate tariffs and kind of maintain gross margins, could you just walk us through maybe some of the specific actions that you're doing there? Ken Miller : Yes, well, the primary action is really just, the geographic footprint of where our products are produced. So we have products, we have plants in China as well as outside of China and Asia and other parts of North America. So, really it's about, shifting some of the supply chain, particularly that headed into the U.S. to some of our alternative supply plants and that's what we've been doing over the last several quarters. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. George Notter : Hi. Thanks a lot guys. I guess I'm curious about your views on the cost structure of the company. I'm thinking about it from an OpEx perspective. If I look back, you've got two years of year-on-year top line declines. The OpEx run rates are still clipping along at $480 million, $490 million a quarter, about the same as even two years ago. So, I guess I'm just curious about your thoughts on an opportunity for cost reductions here or is there something about the business now that makes it more R&D intensive or sales and marketing intensive, any thoughts that would be great. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes, so I actually feel pretty good about our ability to control costs. We've been flat to slightly down over the last couple of years, this would be the second year we're actually on a full year basis, we\u2019ll be slightly down. Clearly that's in the headwinds of cost of living and et cetera. That said, I do think that we are quite honestly, we're optimized where we are. I don't see us going deeper. We've been pretty committed that when we don't grow revenue, we're not going to grow OpEx. But I do think, we've done the low hanging fruit over the last several years on cost controls and OpEx. Take out, if you will, at this point, it requires investment for us to grow and that's what we're focused on. So, going forward, you could expect us to remain prudent, when revenue is challenged we will not be investing much in OpEx, but we want to continue with these investment levels to take advantage of the opportunities we have ahead of us to grow. Rami Rahim : I would just add that, whereas we have been really careful and prudent in how we invest across the board, including R&D, where we have been investing in technologies like 400 gigs, silicon-photonics or our cloud delivered enterprise, which includes our Mist portfolio, our data center technology, I believe are the right areas for us to invest in, in order to achieve long-term growth for this company. So for that reason, I do think that these investments are truly going to payoff for us. George Notter : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Rami Rahim : Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter. That concludes today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jess Lubert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported solid results during the December quarter. Total revenue of $1.280 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance and we returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. Strength for the quarter was driven by our cloud and enterprise verticals which more than offset expected weakness within our service provider business. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 came in $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast as top line strength flowed through to the bottom line. For the year, 2019 played out largely as we anticipated and we were encouraged to finish the year on a high note. Some of the highlights from the year included a third consecutive year of enterprise growth, including a record quarterly performance during the December quarter, a return to year-over-year growth in the cloud vertical following a difficult product transition which we believe will position us for additional growth in the years to come, the successful acquisition of Mist, which is already exceeding our initial expectations and has the potential to have a material positive impact on our P&L on a go forward basis. Strong software growth that we expect is likely to continue due to the value of our off-box platforms like Contrail and efforts to better monetize the value of our existing solutions and significant progress enhancing our go-to-market organization which we believe will help us capitalize on the various technology innovations we are bringing to market and gain share as many of our markets transitioned over the next 2 years. We expect to build on many of these accomplishments in 2020. We believe we are executing well and positioned to sustainably grow the business starting this year. While this will require some incremental investment, particularly in go-to-market, we remain committed to growing non-GAAP earnings this year and expect the investments we are making in 2020 will create the top line momentum needed to drive incremental leverage and earnings growth in future years. Now, I would like to provide some insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with cloud, we experienced better than expected results during the December quarter as the business grew 18% year-over-year, an increase year-over-year for a third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum within our customers, wide area networks, particularly for some of our switching products this past quarter, although our Cloud routing business also saw double-digit growth year-over-year. Order trends remained healthy and despite some likely seasonality, we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business on a year-over-year basis during the March quarter. We are encouraged by the success we are seeing with some of our largest cloud customers and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. That said, we have also been experiencing growth with Tier 2 cloud providers and believe we are gaining share as many of these accounts increasingly leverage their own private clouds. While our existing cloud use cases should present modest growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center, where historically we have maintained limited share. On this last point, we believe we have delivered the systems silicon and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. These solutions are now in our customers\u2019 labs and we remained optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins. While early 400-gig deployments are expected to begin during the second half of the year, we do no expect material revenue to materialize until 2021 due to the availability and cost of optics. We achieved record enterprise results in the December quarter with this business growing 2% year-over-year despite the difficult comparison. These results were better than expected and we were pleased to grow despite a year-over-year decline in our federal business which moderated following several strong quarters. We believe our portfolio of enterprise solutions is truly differentiated and resonating in the market, which is driving increased confidence that the go-to-market investments we are making should position us to take share and grow this business in the years to come even in a challenging macro environment. Some of the items driving confidence in our enterprise outlook include the following. First, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader enterprise market. Mist is a truly differentiated platform that offers industry leading scale and AI capabilities. Mist AI engine leverages more than 4 years of advanced learning to help customers improve network operations and the user experience as compared to our peers which simply focus on uptime of the network access points, routers and switches. Mist capabilities are clearly resonating in the market. Mist\u2019s customer base grew more than 150% year-over-year in the December quarter and aggregate bookings for Mist and the direct pull-through it enables exceeded $100 million run-rate on an annualized basis. While Mist is already exceeding our initial expectations, we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist\u2019s potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio. To this point, we are seeing strong initial demand for our recently launched Mist Wired Assurance that brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the EX portfolio. This capability has already enabled us to secure EX wins with several Fortune 100 accounts, including a Fortune 10 that previously were not Juniper EX customers. We plan to Mistify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio through the year, which we believe should create incremental pull-through opportunities in future periods. We are investing to further monetize Mist with our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 and the AI driven enterprise. Second, our enterprise switching business is seeing healthy momentum growing both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in the December quarter with our QFX data center products experiencing record orders. We believe our industry-leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management software platforms are resonating in the data center market and should position us to grow this business moving forward. While our EX portfolio declined year-over-year, sequential momentum has been strong now for several quarters and we expect to see better year-over-year trends on a go forward basis as the productivity of our go-to-market organization improves after last year\u2019s organizational transformation and the Mist pull-through we are starting to see further materializes. Third, our secure SD-WAN capabilities are seeing healthy traction. While this opportunity remains in the early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security and Wi-Fi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is expected to be a large and fast growing market, but also present another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio. Our service provider business remains challenged. However, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth in the December quarter and the pace of year-over-year declines began to moderate, which is a trend that we expect to continue during the upcoming year. The move of our MX 5G line card from qualifications to deployments, the success of our Contrail telco cloud platform, high-end security opportunities and the availability of new edge products are amongst some of the reasons we expect our service provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods. While our security revenue slightly declined year-over-year during Q4, our security orders grew 24% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year and came in at the highest levels in the last 4 years. We saw notable strength in our mid-range portfolio, which saw orders increase nearly 35% year-over-year and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our high-end offerings. We believe our security portfolio is highly competitive, which was recently validated by NSS Labs, which provided a recommended rating for our high-end data center offerings and Gartner which ranked us as a top supplier for both data center and distributed enterprise security use cases in its critical capabilities report. We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our connected security strategy, which focuses on bundling security with our traditional networking platforms. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 25% year-over-year and accounted for more than 12% of our revenue during the December quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 90% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 170% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist. Based on the momentum we are seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Not to be overlooked, our services business delivered a record quarter and the business grew more than 2% on a full year basis. Our services team continues to execute extremely well with improved attach rates and renewals, the primary factor driving strength in both the quarter and the year. Our service pipeline remains healthy and we remain confident in our ability to once again grow this business during the upcoming year. Finally, I would like to highlight that we are making solid progress in our sales transformation initiatives. Our population of quota carrying sales reps is up by approximately 20% from the trough levels we experienced during the Q1 of 2019 and we are making solid progress against our productivity goals. We believe our investments in go-to-market should create tailwinds through the course of the year and present an important revenue driver that helps us capitalize on the various innovations we are bringing to market, particularly within the enterprise vertical during the upcoming year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.208 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 both above the midpoint of guidance. The higher than midpoint results were driven by greater than anticipated strength in cloud, and to a lesser extent, enterprise. As we expected, we are exiting the year stronger than we entered. We are pleased with our 2% year-over-year growth in total revenue. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, cloud increased 18% and enterprise increased 2%, while service provider declined 5%. On a sequential basis, all verticals, all technologies and all geographies are up. Service provider increased 9% sequentially with growth across all products and services. Enterprise growth of 7% on a sequential basis was primarily driven by switching. Our cloud business increased 3% on a sequential basis primarily driven by routing and services. From a technology perspective, routing grew 4%, switching increased 11% and security grew 7% sequentially. Our services business increased to 3% year-over-year and 7% sequentially primarily due to strong renewals. As Rami mentioned, we saw continued solid performance from our software offerings, which increased 25% year-over-year and was more than 12% of total revenue in the quarter. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were cloud, 6 were service provider, and 1 was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $133 million, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $96 million, down sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to timing differences related to payments to suppliers and customer collections. We expect to see a rebound in cash flow in the first quarter when it will likely exceed $200 million. We paid $64 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in shares, which was completed earlier this month. Moving on to the results for the full year, fiscal 2019 largely played out as we expected with revenue declining 4% versus last year. While the service provider business remained challenged declining 12%, our enterprise business grew for the third consecutive year, and our cloud business returned to full year growth. On a full year basis, security grew 3% year-over-year and our services business grew 2%. Software grew 16% and was greater than 10% of total revenue for the full year. However, routing declined 12% and switching declined 4% versus 2018. Both results were primarily due to weakness in service provider. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 4 were cloud, 5 were service provider and 1 was an enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded over 20 basis points due to the strength in our service margin, which more than offset lower product volume and China\u2019s tariffs. Our focus on disciplined non-GAAP operating expense management continued with a decline in operating expenses of $10 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share declined 9%. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $529 million. During 2019, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. From a return to shareholder perspective, we repurchased $550 million worth of shares and paid $260 million in dividends totaling 193% of free cash flow. In addition, we used approximately $360 million to acquire Mist, and approximately $450 million to pay down debt. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. At the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, we expect year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to grow on a sequential basis and we expect modest growth for the full year. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter and improve with volume throughout the course of the year. While non-GAAP gross margins can be difficult to predict and can be impacted by deal and customer mix, we currently expect full year gross margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2019 levels. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially due to the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase in fringe costs. Through the course of 2020, we expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expense to remain near Q1 levels. While we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be up on a full year basis, as we invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to discipline operating expense management and expect earnings to grow in 2020. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be 19% plus or minus 1%. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. Now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hey, guys. Nice to see the cloud business clicking again. Can you talk about visibility in the cloud business and revenue concentration there? How has that improved? And as 400 kicks in, I know you\u2019ve talked about more the next year event, but you expect that ramp to be lumpy. How should we think about that? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, needless to say, it\u2019s great to see the performance in our cloud business in the Q4 time frame. The year largely played out as we expected, in fact, probably saw a little bit stronger results in the Q4 timeframe than what we had originally anticipated. The success in the hyperscaler is always going to be concentrated and CapEx concentrated. However, I\u2019m pleased with the fact that we saw success across a broad number of customers, not just within the hyperscalars, but also in Tier 2 cloud where I think we\u2019re doing actually quite well. Also the breadth of the technologies with strength in those switching and in routing, that we\u2019re quite pleased with. We have a unique position when it comes to the routing footprint that we retain in the hyperscale space. And we fought hard to retain it, as you know, with the prior transition that we\u2019ve undertaken over the last year and a half. At this point, I think that is largely behind us and we are now in a situation where the strength of the business, the momentum is going to be very much based on the timing of deployments. So that I think gets us to sort of mid to low single digit growth type rates in the cloud segments in the 2020 timeframe. Certainly, as you get into the 400 gig deployments, and in particular, in the data centre and DCI that post, that presents a much bigger opportunity for us to go after. And we\u2019re doing just that. I mean, all of our focus, our energy, our investments are going into the 400 gig system, the software, the specific features that our customers are requiring and we are engaging with our customers in order to have a very good shot at not just getting our fair share, but more than our fair share in that segment. And timing of that is going to be closer to the end of the year into next year for where meaningful revenue happens. And it\u2019s largely tied to the timing of the projects within hyperscale as well as the finding and availability of 400-gig optics. Ittai Kidron : Got it. And as a follow-up it\u2019s very nice to see that mist is kind of pulling EX, but maybe can you tell us, is that the mode of operation? Do you lead with a bundle right now or mid sales people try to make introductions or \u2013 and vice versa? How much of this is truly the preferred path for you into customers? Rami Rahim : That\u2019s a great question. I think there are really two sales plays that we undertake when it comes to the enterprise space and the specific customer and their requirements, their presence. So one sales play is very much data center oriented and it is around satisfying the sort of highly automated private cloud data center with a simple fabric management, high performance, EVP and VXLAN type functionality that I think we have real strength and we saw really good momentum in the data center, switching space in the Q4 time-frame, in fact, record orders for the QFX in Q4, largely driven by both cloud as well as the enterprise. The second sales play is very much aligned with what you\u2019re talking about, which is around the campus. And there we are finding a lot of success in leading with Mist, the highly differentiated cloud-based management, AI-driven simplicity and user experience that now allows us to start the conversation to open the door and then to insert EX switching, which I think is leading to the sequential performance that we\u2019re starting to see with the EX portfolio. And I\u2019ll just mention that we just recently introduced functionality that makes that sales play not just one of a commercial play, where we start with one product and then leads us to a conversation with the other, it\u2019s very much a technical tie-in where the Mist cloud, the management, the AI analytics and assurance now actually technically ties in the acts where you give the customer the ability to look at the performance of their network across both wired and wireless and I think that\u2019s a very unique offering that we have now in the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess supposed to adjusting the free cash flow numbers, historically I think December quarter has been one of the better free cash flow quarters for you guys, the conversion at least versus net income was fairly low. Can we just talk about what happened in the December quarter free cash? When should we expect that to pick-up as you go into the March quarter? Ken Miller : Yes. So free cash flow was down a little bit compared to our normal kind of seasonal average, primarily just due to timing of both purchases as well as some cash collections from customers. We did see a build-up in deferred revenue and we saw some strong bookings particularly in the services side, service renewals and you see our DSL also went up in the Q4 time period which is not abnormal. We absolutely expect that timing to revert. We expect Q1 to be a strong cash flow quarter for us. In fact, I would expect it to exceed $200 million in Q1. So the cash \u2013 the cash flow that you were expecting to see in Q4 was just pushed down a bit into the Q1 timing. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Really appreciate that. And then, I guess, I\u2019ll just follow up. When I listened to your calendar \u201820 commentary around gross margin being flat to slightly up, OpEx, I think, you said would be up year-over-year as well. What does that embed from a revenue perspective for you guys? Is that going to be some flat volumes or does that factor in some revenue leverage as well? Because, I guess, I would think if revenues are up we would see better leverage, especially in the gross margin line. Ken Miller : Yes. For revenue, we were comfortable with current Street estimates for 2020, which we\u2019re looking for about 1% growth. From a gross margin perspective, we think flat to slightly up volume would help, but modest growth, call 1% level, it\u2019s not going to have a tremendous impact on gross margins. I\u2019d expect flat to slightly up gross margin perspective. We are driving for a full year earnings growth in 2020 as well. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just start off with the telecom vertical and kind of what\u2019s embedded in terms of revenue outlook. As you mentioned, your full year outlook is for modest revenue growth, but how you think about the telecom vertical within that? And what could potentially drive some upside to the expectations. What do you need to see from the service providers? Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly, Samik. So, we actually saw a pretty good recovery on a sequential basis in telcos and the service provider vertical in Q4. 2019 was largely played out as we expected, we had expected the second half to be stronger than the first half, and that essentially panned out as expected. A lot of the momentum was in the Q4 timeframe. There is a couple of reasons for this : one is, timing of orders, timing of projects that we had visited into. There\u2019s only so much time that a service provider can go without having to invest in their network. So that certainly benefited us. The other thing that I\u2019d like to call out is, the breadth of the solutions that we\u2019re now selling into the telco domain where we have, obviously, very tight relationships and strategic discussions with is increasing. So not only are we now selling routing technology, which is our traditional business, but we saw good strength in switching and in security. Not to mention in software, in particularly, around the cloud and telco cloud solutions that we\u2019re now offering across a large number of customers. So when I extrapolate out into 2020, I would not return \u2013 I would not estimate or predict a return to growth. I think growth is in the cards for further out in a couple of years timeframe, but for 2020, I\u2019d say, less headwinds supported by some of these other solutions that we are now introducing and selling to our telco customers. I do think that there are going to be some catalysts out there that we can leverage. 5G, although the timing is somewhat unpredictable, I do believe it\u2019s going to be big and it\u2019s going to be a catalyst for investments that will play out over a number of years. Our Metro portfolio which will start to come together for us later this year, I think will be good. Our partnerships, our strategic partnerships with companies like Ericsson, I think starts to help and not to mention just the portfolio. So we introduced last year some pretty meaningful enhancements and upgrades to our MX portfolio and those have gone through certifications. And I think we\u2019ve now started getting into the early deployments I think, starts to benefit us throughout this year. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. If I can just follow-up, on the last earnings call, you had mentioned you are seeing some weakness in the bookings from the enterprise customers. You had revenue growth with the Enterprise vertical this quarter. But if you can just kind of help us with whatever the trends you saw play-out during the quarter, how did it end the quarter in terms of bookings? How did you end the quarter? Rami Rahim : Yes. We did mention in Q3 that we were seeing some more caution from some of our Enterprise customers. And I\u2019d say that Q4 played out largely as Q3 did. There is some level of caution that is out there that is maybe delaying some orders, however, look, I mean, we had a good enterprise quarter. I think even in a scenario where there is weakness in the macro, our share in the enterprise vertical leaves a lot of room for growth and I have optimism based on the strength of our portfolio, especially around the data center switching portfolio as well as the campus wired wireless switching solution as well. And couple that with the hard work that the that we did over the last year in restructuring our sales force, cutting in order to invest in front line sellers that we are now starting to see the benefit of. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, compared to trough levels of last year, where we stopped we are now at 20% increase in the number of quota carrying sales reps that are out already. Now many of them are relatively new and are still in the process of becoming fully productive. I think as that happens throughout this year, we\u2019re going to start \u2013 we are going to really benefit from it, especially second half of the year. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. The first one is, just maybe if we could double click a little bit on what\u2019s occurring in your gross margins. In other words, I guess I\u2019m trying to get a better understanding of how much of the forecast for the year as well as the March quarter is related to mix, geographies, customer mix, product mix. I know all these sort of factor-in, but maybe if you could help us with a bridge to get an idea of how to model that? Ken Miller : Yes. So deal mix is very much two factor, I would say. If you look at the full year basis, 2019 versus 2018, the primary driver to the drop-in product gross margin was both tariff and volume. So mix did not play a big factor on full year basis \u201819 versus \u201818 however in a quarterly basis, so for example, Q3 last year versus Q4, the quarter we just ended, you did see some negative mix trends that affected the margin marginally. So any given quarter, it\u2019s going to vary based on deal mix on a kind of a more longer term period, we\u2019re managing it quite effectively. We did see some headwinds last year with tariffs as well as boiling things down. Those are really the two drivers in the product was margin. We saw tremendous strength in service gross margin, which enabled us to deliver fairly flattish, overall gross margins for the company. Simon Leopold : And then as follow-up, just want to get a better sense of the 400-gig market opportunity. It sounds like you are a little bit more pessimistic about the timing, pushing the volume into 2021. And I guess one of the things I\u2019m trying to understand here is, will you be shipping essentially 400-gig capable chassis in essentially establishing a footprint that might be equipped with 100-gig optics waiting for the optics to be at the right price point or does the whole product cycle really go along with the optics availability and is really a 2021 cycle? Hopefully that makes sense. Rami Rahim : It certainly does. And let me be clear, I think that\u2019s what we are seeing with respect to the timing of 400-gig. Of the solution, deployments, the opportunity that is there for us is not different than anything that our peers are seeing as well. We\u2019ve done everything that is in our control right now. I mean, retaining our routing footprint was necessary because that gives us an amazing platform off of which to increase our relevance within the cloud vertical and we\u2019ve done that. In terms of the solutions and the product, we already have our first 400-gig systems that are in the market based on both custom and merchant silicon, the new operating system that\u2019s very much developed with our cloud vertical in mind, with the kind of modularity, Linux-native capability, the programmability has now seen its way into the market. We are very much engaged with our customers in early deployments, in early lab certifications. And the timing is essentially tied to the timing that our customers are looking to deploy. And yes, optics plays a big role in the timing and not just the availability of the optics, but also in the \u2013 the economics of those optics. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the questions. If I can start just on a strategic basis, one of your biggest competitors has talked recently about selling silicon directly into the cloud verticals, obviously, getting what\u2019s your proprietary silicon strategy? I\u2019m just curious of how you think about whether or not that would present an opportunity for Juniper to do something similar or how you see that engagement possibly, with some of the cloud customers? I do have a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Aaron. I will start by just saying that, I have a ton of confidence and I certainly have a lot of experience and background in this domain from my engineering days here at Juniper. In our silicon strategy, in our silicon execution and the strength and the competitiveness of our silicon products that make their way into a variety of our systems, in particular, when it comes to 400-gig, I think we have a unique offering already in the market, but still to come in terms of the full breadth of the solutions that we are bringing to market based both up on merchants silicon, in certain classes of switching silicon, but also on custom silicon that we have developed over the last several years. When it comes to sort of efficiency performance coupled with security and encryption, we really believe that we have done something very special here. So very well equipped to deal with what we know is a competitive environment. Disaggregation, selling software and silicon separately is not a new concept. In fact, I believe architecturally we have done a lot over the last couple of years to disaggregate our software from our silicon in a way that allows us to achieve much more nimbleness in how we develop our systems and can move and adapt to different silicon offerings. That said, in terms of the business model of selling software and silicon separately, we certainly we have experienced, because we have now done this for quite some time in selling software separately from the system and from silicon. We did \u2013 we started this doing \u2013 we started this, years ago. As far as selling silicon separately, while I have confidence in our silicon itself, that business model, I am not sure that there would be a huge market for it, quite frankly. So it\u2019s something that we would be open to, it is something that we would take a close look at going forward. But for now, we\u2019re going to be very focused on selling the systems, the software and the silicon photonics capabilities when they hit the market later this year. Aaron Rakers : Yes. That\u2019s great answer. And then just as a quick follow-up, just on a model basis back to the gross margin. When I look at gross margin here in this last quarter, you saw a pretty healthy services gross margin. Was there a one-time items in there or how do we think about the services gross margin going forward relative to the \u2013 I think it was 65% you just reported. Ken Miller : Yes. So services gross margin clearly benefited from the very strong services revenue. As you saw, actually a little bit more less there than we expected beginning in the quarter. The cost is little more fixed. Most of our cost of services is really our \u2013 our services JTech facilities, labs, etcetera. So we are seeing a relatively stable cost line and its revenue ramps sequentially as it did last year. You did see a bigger market than normal. I would expect that to come down a bit in Q1 as revenue seasonally will come down for services and the cost will remain kind of at fixed levels. Aaron Rakers : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please proceed. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thank you. And Rami, I am hoping to peel back that answer on the independent ship a little bit, why don\u2019t you think that there would be a market for standalone silicon? And then I guess the broader question with that is do you feel like the Cisco announcement makes the web scale market more or potentially less competitive heading into the 400G cycle? Rami Rahim : I think the cloud demand has always been a very competitive environment and let\u2019s just say that we are very used to and comfortable operating in that competitive environment and doing well despite the competition. Again, I will just reiterate part of my answer I think that there is a large market out there for selling the software. Many of our customers are looking at buying especially off-box software. The opportunity to sell a network operating system disaggregated from silicon, we have a ton of experience here is limited. There are only a few number of customers that are interested in that model. Lot of them talked about it, but ultimately they desire the simplicity of a system that includes the software and in some case merchant silicon, in other cases in custom silicon. As far as selling silicon separately like I said, the focus for us right now is on a technology that we believe has breadth in demand and that is in the 400-gig silicon photonics space. As far as silicon forwarding engines and switch silicon is concerned, I doubt that if we entered that market, we are going to see the other OEMs being customers of ours. So that really limits it to the cloud providers themselves. And based on our conversations, very specific engagements that we are having with them, I think for now the demand is more in the converged systems and meeting their requirements in terms of the programmability, the telemetry capabilities, the power, efficiency, the performance of their requirements that we are confident that we are satisfying. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, thank you. And then it seems you say that Tier 2 cloud was an area of success for you, how much runway do you have in that? Is that a sustainable theme for 2020 and beyond? Rami Rahim : I think so yes, because what we are seeing with Tier 2 cloud is. First, there are number of customers that we have seen sort of pivot back to a strategy where they want to deploy their own data centers as opposed to just moving to or embracing the public cloud offering. So that certainly is a trend that will help Tier 2 specifically. Second, not only did we retain customers and saw sort of strength in the build out of data center worldwide, but we have won some new logos that I think will help us in coming quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed. Alex Henderson : Thank you very much. Just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics around what you are suggesting for the 2020 timeframe. It sounds like 2% revenue growth, modest increase in gross margins. Are you suggesting that your OpEx increases will be roughly comparable to the revenue growth? And therefore the only margin leverage you will have is slight improvement in gross margin hence operating profit growth fairly consistent with the revenue growth? Is that the way we should be reading the commentary on 2020? Ken Miller : Yes. So we are comfortable with the current Street revenue estimates for 2020, which are approximately 1% revenue growth. I believe at those kind of revenue numbers we should expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up. OpEx will be up on a full year basis. I do expect us to continue to be opportunistic with our capital return program as well with share buybacks. So the combination of that we believe will get us to earnings growth on a full year basis next year or this year. Alex Henderson : I see. And just going back to the commentary around the switching market, is your co-packaged technology helping you penetrate into any of the Tier 1 cloud companies where they want to get experience with that co-packaging functionality? It seems that, that\u2019s one of the distinguishing characteristics of your 100-gig products currently and obviously, it would be better to learn about it at 100-gig and then try to deploy it at 400-gig? Rami Rahim : Alex, I am not sure I fully understand the question, but when I think co-packaging really that comes to co-packaging of optics and switching silicon. That\u2019s something that\u2019s more a future trend that we do believe in, but it\u2019s not a here and now it will actually take a number of years before that becomes a necessity or something that\u2019s technically or economically feasible. Having said that, we do very much believe that our silicon photonics technology, our IP that we have that we are initially embracing to put into standalone pluggable transceivers has future applicability into co-packaging. And that is an outcome that we very much are working towards, but it\u2019s certainly not a here and now, it\u2019s really more of a future trend. Alex Henderson : Yes, thank you. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Ashwin Kesireddy : Hi, thank you for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I got one two-part question and one another question on APAC. First on 400-gig, Rami, can you give us an update on the timing of 400-gig silicon photonics and any update on the progress there? And sort of related to that, I wanted to check if you guys are willing to sell 400-gig boxes to run someone else\u2019s software on it? And I have a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks, Ashwin. So silicon photonics, a lot of progress has been made. The big challenge with silicon photonics is not so much about the technology itself. I believe from a technology standpoint we have something that\u2019s unique, highly differentiated in the market today or relative to what\u2019s out there in the market today. The challenges around production manufacturing in large volumes and what we have done over the last several months now is that we have struck up strategic partnerships with strong manufacturing entities, companies, fab houses that specialize in this type of technology that will mitigate the risks associated with the large scale manufacturing of the technology. So at this point, I feel good about the differentiation. I feel good and confident that we are going to get to a solution that we can ship to our customers later this year. And this is not easy, this is certainly a lot of technical hurdles that are in the way, but I do believe that we are overcoming one by one. And like I said, before the end of the year we should have our first products in the market. As far as your question, yes, a question about 400-gig, so it is \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting question, I actually think the demand \u2013 there is a greater demand for software \u2013 network operating system software that will sit on white box hardware than there is for something that is the other way around. That said, what there is of course an interest in by some of our cloud customers in particular is a very efficient implementation of SONiC on a system that we build that could either be merchant or in some cases custom. And so SONiC as sort of this lightweight NOS, network operating system that some of our cloud customers are asking for, something that we have very much embraced, we have invested in, we have demoed versions of this on our systems that I think have demonstrated to our customers how seriously we are and there is more to come in this space. Ashwin Kesireddy : Thank you. And just as a follow-up on Asia-Pacific and the revenue growth there, I think that region has been declining for about eight quarters straight now. Just wondering what\u2019s driving that and what could sort of turn around the business there? Rami Rahim : Yes, I will take that. So, I think part of this has to do with the fact that some of our big customers in the APAC region, we really had \u2013 we had some level of concentration, especially in the telco space and to a lesser degree in the cloud space that \u2013 just we are not spending as much over the last few quarters as they had done traditionally and that resulted in some weakness. I also just would acknowledge, I think we have had some execution challenges in Asia-Pacific that we have had to address and we are actually going to be announcing a new APAC leader fairly imminently at this point. Ken Miller : Yes. I would just add that we did see two consecutive quarters of sequential growth in Asia-Pac and we did see enterprise up on a year-on-your basis. So we are seeing some pockets of strength there. I think there is more to come. I would expect all of our geographies to have the potential to grow in 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks, guys. You spoke about the 20% increase in quota-carrying comps and I just wanted to kind of check and make sure that kind of all positions that you were looking to hire for are filled at this point and then just increases in OpEx throughout 2020 are just more commissions as they become productive? And then I have a second question. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the questions. So, most of the positions have been filled. Our OpEx outlook certainly factors in both the filled positions and those that we anticipate will be filled shortly. And I just highlight the fact that we took the harder path here of cutting to invest. We have restructured. We reduced layers and increased span of control and simplified the organization, which freed up the capacity for us to go and to invest in frontline sellers and I think that has \u2013 that was tough to do, but it was the right thing to do. So certainly, you will not see a 20% increase in OpEx for our sales organization, but it\u2019s great to see that we are going to have 20% more sellers that are actively positioning and selling the technology and the differentiation that we believe we have, especially in the enterprise space. Meta Marshall : Got it. And then just maybe on the CTO transition, just any kind of customer feedback or kind of as Raj starts making the rounds with customers any kind of early commentary would be helpful? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that the CTO transition has gone remarkably smoothly. Bikash did a very nice job in sort of seamlessly transition over to Raj. There was in fact a period of overlap between the two executives. Raj is an outstanding technical leader that has experience in the cloud provider space, but also in the enterprise, was at Intel for a number of years, so has some experience in the silicon photonics space, at VMware, lot of experience in enterprise software. So, I think the breadth of his experience has already in just the month or two that he has been onboard been a huge benefit to us and I think he is going to do a fantastic job leading the technical strategy in this company going forward. Meta Marshall : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed. Paul Silverstein : Thanks guys for taking the question. And I will apologize because I am going to ask you to revisit some questions from earlier. First off, Ken, on the margin questions you have been asked, a couple of things. One, I thought that the announced reduction in the last round of tariffs, I thought that, that would benefit you and your peers, will that not be the case? Secondly, what is the rate of price erosion, has that changed one way or the other? I assume from your margin guidance, it hasn\u2019t. And third, going back to Simon\u2019s question, when we think about the levers going forward, it sounds like mix is the number one lever. If I look at what you did back when before you had the whole MX to PTX and the impact to new revenue, you were doing 64 and 63 off several 100 million or higher revenue. Is it to get back to that level or to get back to the 62 plus, is it primarily a function of better volumes that magnitude or is there something else? And then I have got a straightforward question Rami in your response to the demand question, if I may? Rami Rahim : Yes. So with respect to tariffs, first, I would say that we have been predicting tariffs would impact our business by 30 to 50 basis points for the year and that\u2019s largely played out as we expected. I would remind you that\u2019s a total gross margin impact. If you actually take the impact of product gross margin, it\u2019s greater than that as the denominator gets smaller, right. So if you look at product only gross margin, the tariff impact is greater than 30 to 50 basis points. As it relates to Wave 4 and the change there, we did not see a benefit in time to impact Q2. We will slightly benefit from that in the Q1 tariffs. But our biggest opportunity is to continue to mitigate the entirety of the tariff as we continue to look at retooling our supply chain. So, that\u2019s something that\u2019s ongoing. We weren\u2019t able to mitigate much in Q4. In fact, our Q4 tariff exposure was the highest of any of the quarters in 2019 which is time, just not having enough time to really react to Wave 4. We are now reacting and we expect to be able to mitigate some tariff impact going forward. As far as the big levers, I would order them and volume is number one. I mean, we did although we are pleased with our Q4 returned to growth we are still seeing product revenue down. That is obviously a negative to our gross margin, our product gross margin in particular. So getting the volume back would be number one. Obviously, if we can mitigate tariffs further that would help. And last but not least, on a mixed perspective, as our software business continues to get stronger, particularly as we start to get more renewals in our subscription software business, we should see some lift in our software margin as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Brian Yun : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Also I had kind of a question on 2020 outlook, mainly the levers for sort of top line growth. Wondering in your view sort of what those are that can kind of cause revenue to perform better than expected and then any headwinds or speed bumps we should kind of be aware of in 2020, maybe if you could talk about the cloud and enterprise vertical, I think you touched on service provider earlier? So that would that would be helpful. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Let me start and maybe Ken has something to add. And it\u2019s best to think about it from the standpoint of verticals. I think in the cloud space we saw good \u2013 we closed the year strong in 2019. I wouldn\u2019t expect that Q4 performance is sort of sustainable on an ongoing basis based purely on the footprint that we have. I think sort of mid single-digit \u2013 mid to low single-digit growth rates in the cloud provider space based on existing footprint is a reasonable assumption. In the enterprise space, I would say continued momentum and if anything maybe even better strength in the second half of the year as we get to more productivity with the increased number of sellers that we have, that\u2019s out there not to mention the continuously increasing strength of our joint portfolio. So, the EX switching portfolio being managed by the Mist cloud, the initial versions of that have now entered the market, it\u2019s only going to get stronger and more competitive throughout the year. So I am quite optimistic about the enterprise vertical in 2020. And I think that\u2019s going to be a good growth catalyst for us. In SP, it\u2019s moderating declines, right, sort of mid single-digit declines in SP is probably in the right ballpark. And it\u2019s based on a number of factors that have already highlighted around the fact that SPs need to invest eventually, 5G becoming more of a catalyst to investments, the fact that we are broadening our solutions in our portfolio that we are selling to the SP into software switching and security. That\u2019s how we think about it. Ken Miller : No, I think that makes sense. I think if you wanted to ask what could go wrong, I would say, clearly the enterprise business operating in that dynamic macro environment, if that were to change materially that could have an impact on our ability to grow enterprise, Rami already mentioned kind of service provider and cloud. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Please proceed. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I have two questions. You had new MX and PTX products out in the market recently, I wonder if you could update us on the uptake and refresh opportunities? And then secondly, you have talked about switching strength into when opportunities in the cloud, I wonder if you could clarify whether these were new wins that were coming through? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. So as far as the routing products, MX and PTX, I think we have now seen a few quarters of PTX momentum driven largely by the cloud vertical. And I am quite optimistic that, that can continue. The MX, we introduced new MX 5G line cards, roughly at first half of last year timeframe. Those typically take 6 months to 9 months of certification. That has happened now over the last couple of quarters. And I think that starts to result in some growth opportunities for us into 2020. And I think the second question was around switching in the cloud provider space and whether there were net new logos? And the answer is, yes, in the Tier 2 space I think we have seen momentum as a result of both satisfying the growth demand of Tier 2 clouds, especially Tier 2 cloud providers that have made a strategic decision to either stick with or to in-source their data center infrastructure, but also net new logos worldwide that I think will help us throughout this year. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have allotted for our question-and-answer session. Allow me to hand the floor back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks. Jess Lubert : Before we conclude the call, I do want to make you aware we will be hosting a Tech Talk on our secure SD-WAN strategy on Thursday, February 13. We will also be attending the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley technology conferences this quarter. Thank you for your questions and we look forward to meeting and speaking with you through the quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us during these difficult times. Before I comment on our results, I'd like make a few comments regarding the Covid-19 pandemic which is impacting the way all of us work and live. I like to emphasis that the help and safety of our employees, customers and business partners remain our top priority and remain an integral part of all we do. I couldn't be more proud of the Juniper team which has worked tirelessly to meet the needs of our customer and deliver new innovation to market despite the recent challenges introduced by Covid-19. I believe we are well positioned not only navigate the current crisis, but also to emerge stronger player. In the meantime, we are helping to support the fight against Covid-19 by offering free secured wireless connectivity kit to pop up field hospitals and giving back to the community through the Juniper Foundation which is working to support those in needs during this difficult time. And now on to our results. We reported Q1 revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $998 million and $0.23 respectively both slightly below the low end of our guidance. Revenue for Q1 was impacted due to Covid-19 related supply chain challenges, which negatively affected customer lead time and our ability to recognize the revenue in the quarter, particularly within our service provider business. However, actual Q1 demand remained healthy with product orders growing 10% year-over-year.  We experienced Q1 order growth across all customers vertical, if not for challenges securing supply, we believe our Q1 revenue and non-GAAP EPS would have been between the mid and high end of our guidance range. We are entering Q2 with strong backlog and starting to see improvements within our supply chain, which Ken will touch on in greater detail during his prepared remarks. We are also seeing healthy momentum in our Cloud and Service Provider businesses, which typically account for approximately 55% of sales in any given quarter. We believe these businesses are likely to prove resilience within the current environment and could even benefit from the recent surge in traffic that is straining many networks around the world. While our enterprise pipeline has softened as a result of Covid-19 induced macro pressure, this has been factored into our near-term forecasts and is the primary driver behind our increased range for the June quarter and the withdrawal of prior commentary for the full year. I'd like to emphasize that Juniper remains financially strong with more than $2.5 billion in cash and highly liquid securities as compared to just $1.7 billion in debt. We also maintain an untapped $500 million credit facility. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 and we have no debt maturing until 2024. We believe these attributes should not only position us to weather the current crisis but also to support our customers and take opportunistic action that helped us come out stronger and gain share as a business environment eventually improve. Now I'd like to provide some insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core vertical. Starting with Cloud, we experienced better than expected results during the March quarter as a business grew 17% year-over-year and increased year-over-year for a fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum within our Cloud customers wide area network particularly for some of our switching products although our clouds routing business also saw double-digit growth year-over-year. Order trends remained healthy as we saw improved momentum across multiple hyperscale account and continued strength with our Tier-2 customers. Based on our Q1 results and recent order, we still expect to modestly grow our cloud business in 2020. We maintain strong and durable franchises at each of our hyper skilled customers and should be well positioned to benefit from the capacity growth in use cases we own. We continue to remain optimistic regarding our potential to win net new hyperscale use cases during the 400 gig cycle. We are in the process of working through customer qualifications and believe we have delivered the software systems and silicon needed to gain share within the opportunities we are targeting. While we are ready to meet our customers' requirement, we do anticipate some risk to 400 gig timeline in light of the current Covid-19 challenges, which may slow testing and cause some customers to focus more on scaling existing, footprint and less on deployment of new network architectures. While our Service Provider Business declined 14% year-over-year during Q1, this business was most heavily impacted by Covid-19 related supply chain challenges as I previously mentioned. If not for these challenges, we anticipate our service provider business would have experienced a mid to high single digit year-over-year decline and performed in line with our original expectations for the period. Importantly, our service provider orders increased 4% year-over-year in Q1 representing the first year-over-year increase since 2017. While we believe we are seeing some modest Covid-19 related benefits within our service provider business, we believe most of the service provider orders strength we experience is attributable to our diversification efforts across customers and products over the last few years. To this point, we are starting to see improved momentum with several of our US Cable customers as well as tier-2 and tier-3 carriers in international markets. We are also seeing increased carrier adoption of our switching and security offering in addition to our traditional routing platforms. We believe we remain well-positioned with our service provider customers and that our continuing efforts to diversify our customer base and increase the breadth of our offering should benefit this business throughout the remainder of the year. While we acknowledge that some of our service provider customers are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters, based on our recent momentum and customer conversation, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid-single digit decline in 2020. Our enterprise business experienced 5% sales growth and double-digit order growth during Q1. We experienced growth in both our Campus and datacenter offering with strengthened US more than offsetting some enterprise headwinds in EMEA and APAC where demand impacts of Covid-19 became more apparent earlier in the quarter. We believe our Q1 results speak to the strength of our enterprise portfolio and ability to gain share even in the challenged environment. While our enterprise orders were strong during the March quarter, we lost some momentum towards the end of the period and our pipeline has been impacted by Covid-19 related macro dynamics that are clouding our visibility into Q2 and the remainder of the year. We now believe our enterprise business is likely to decline sequentially during the June quarter and come in weaker than we previously expected for the year. Despite the Covid-19 related headwind we are facing, we remain confidence regarding our ability to gain enterprise share for the following reason. First, we continue to see strong momentum with Mist which we acquired in April 1st of last year and are the center piece of our AI enterprise strategy. Mist makes networking simple for customers and improves the user experience and reduces its operational costs. We believe these attributes are likely to resonate with customers under any environment. We are seeing this in our continued business momentum. New Mist logos through more than a 100% year-over-year in the March quarter and standalone Mist bookings exceeded a $100 million run rate on an annualized basis. While Mist is continuing to exceed expectation, we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio. To this point, we are seeing strong demand for our Mist wired assurance offering that launched in Q4 of last year and brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the ES portfolio. This capability has now enabled us to secure EX wins with three Fortune 10 account and in Q1 over a 100 joint Mist and EX customers. We plan to mystify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio throughout the year, which should create increment pull through opportunities for enterprise offering in future period. Second, we believe our enterprise switching portfolios continuing to gain share with both revenues and orders growing during the March quarter. We believe our industry-leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management are positioned to win in the datacenter market while our ES portfolio is likely to benefit from synergy with Mist and pull through from our Wired Assurance offerings in future quarters. Third, I believe the investments we have made in our go-to-market organization over the last 12-months should position us to capitalize on our innovation, particularly in the enterprise market as conditions improve and our account reps ramp to full productivity. And fourth, our enterprise mix should work in our favor given our high exposure to government sector and mid to large-sized enterprise account, which are likely to prove more resilient to recent industry headwind and be well positioned to recover when the environment normalizes. I'd like to mention that we are continuing to see momentum in our security and software segment. Our security revenue increased 10% year-over-year in Q1 due to strong demand for our high-end portfolio, which continues to gain traction particularly with our cloud and service provider customers. We remain encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our secured networking strategy which focuses on embedded security of the key elements of several routing and switching solution. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Our software business grew 9% year-over-year and accounted for more than 11% of revenue in Q1. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on box software licenses, our off box software orders increase more than 50% year-over-year and off box subscriptions increased more than 180% year-over-year due to Mist.  Based on the momentum we're seeing, we believe our software; the percentage of revenue will continue to increase over time especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by discussing our first quarter results inclusive of supply chain challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, then provide some color on our outlook and end with an overview of our financial position in light of the pandemic. We ended the first quarter of 2020 at $998 million in revenue flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.23. Both results were slightly below the low end of our guidance range due to supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Without the impact of the pandemic related supply constraints, we estimate that revenue and non-GAAP EPS would have been between the mid and high end of the range we provided in January. I'd like to briefly address some of the dynamics in our supply chain. We have a global supply chain footprint with our primary manufacturing partners located in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States. Our component suppliers are even more geographically distributed with suppliers from many countries throughout the world. During the quarter, the supply constraints we experienced were due to both constrained manufacturing capacity particularly in China and Malaysia, as well as component parts shortages as our component suppliers were also facing manufacturing challenges. These challenges resulted in extended lead times to our customers and ultimately caused us to fall short of our revenue guidance for the quarter. While the situation remains very dynamic, we have improvements to our manufacturing capacity. However, we expect several of our component suppliers will remain challenged throughout most of the second quarter as they are operating under restricted work condition. As a result, we have factored continued supply chain challenges into our current Q2 forecast. While we have a robust and flexible supply chain, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the industry unprecedented challenges. Our supply chain teams have been working tirelessly to meet our customer needs during the pandemic. We have been executing a strong risk mitigation plan including multi-sourcing, pre-ordering components, transforming our logistics network and prioritizing critical customers, all the while we are working with local government agencies to understand challenges and partner on solutions that ensure the safety of our employees, partners and suppliers. As a result of these mitigation efforts, we believe we are delivering the best possible outcomes for safety and satisfying customer needs and we will continue to do so. Turning back to the first quarter results, while supply constraints negatively impacted our top and bottom line results, we saw strong demand in the quarter with orders growing 10% year-over-year exceeding our expectations. Additionally, the order strength was broad-based with all verticals and all geographies growing year-over-year. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud increased 17% and Enterprise increased 5% while service provider declined 14%. If not for the supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic, service provider revenue decline would have likely been in the mid to high single digits. From a technology perspective, switching revenue increased 25% year-over-year and security revenue increased 10% year-over-year. Routing revenue which was the most impacted by supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic decreased 16% year-over-year. Our services business increased 2% year-over-year. We continue to see solid performance from our software offerings where software revenue was approximately 11% of total revenue and grew 9% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, in-line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 1%year-over-year and were flat sequentially, which was slightly below the low-end of our guidance range. As expected, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was strong at $272 million. We paid $66million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Also repurchased $200 million worth of shares in the open market and completed accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $2.5 billion which was flat from the fourth quarter 2019. Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our service provider and cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the enterprise market. Due to the uncertain macro environment, we have widened our revenue range for the second quarter. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be essentially flat sequentially relative to the first quarter. We expect to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain related cost due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We expect second quarter non-GAAP operating expense to decline sequentially as we continue to focus on prudent cost management, while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. While we are optimistic regarding our long-term prospects and opportunity to gain share across each of our customer verticals, we are withdrawing our previously announced full year 2020 commentary because we cannot predict the specific extent or duration of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financial results. Turning to our capital return program, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the second quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend. And while we expect to remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks, we expect to place a greater emphasis on further building liquidity in this uncertain environment. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to spend a few moments outlining the financial strength of Juniper in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have a high degree of confidence and our ability to meet our commitment and weather the current economic environment. Juniper is a financially strong company with over $2.5 billion in highly liquid, high credit rated cash and investments with access to additional liquidity sources, if needed. We are profitable and generate strong operating cash flows, both of which we currently expect will continue. Further, the diversity of our revenue streams is favorable and our position with our cloud and service provider customers should help offset pressure in the enterprise market. We intend to implement additional cost controls by continuing to invest in areas to take advantage of the market opportunities ahead. Our objective is to protect our talent and at this time we expect to retain our workforce. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we believe we are well positioned to sustain a financial strength. Our long-term financial principles remain unchanged. Our objective is to grow revenue, expand earnings over time and maintain our balanced capital strategy. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question, SamikChatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. If I can just start off with the cloud revenue growth that you had double-digit growth for a couple of quarters now. If you can help me think about how much of that growth is being driven by your existing customers and if there were any new logo wins in the tier-2 cloud side that helped on that front? And I believe you've briefly mentioned WAN upgrades with cloud customers. Are you expecting any cloud customers to act straight line upgrade activities as they scale the current architecture that you were referring to? RamiRahim: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Samik. So obviously very pleased with our results in the cloud vertical, 70% year-over-year growth in revenue. This is actually the fourth quarter in a row where we've seen year-over-year strengths and in fact the strength was pretty broad based across technologies both sorry -- in all three areas of routing, switching and security. The other thing that I liked about the results in Q1 is the breadth across Tier-1 hyperscale cloud providers, as well as Tier-2 and Tier-3. In the Tier-1 space, it's mostly around the deployed footprint that we already have and the traffic requirements over those networks which resulted in goods bookings and revenue momentum and in the Tier-2, 3 space there were some of that as well as and in that area because we've really been focusing on net new logos in our go-to-market organization. There were probably a few new accounts that contributed to the momentum as well. SamikChatterjee: Okay and if I can just quickly follow up with, Ken, on the gross margin. Was there any headwind in 1Q gross margin from the supply chain challenges that you have? And I think you mentioned in your commentary here strategic insertion opportunities that are offset to gross margins in 2Q. Can you just elaborate on that? KenMiller: Yes. So from a gross margin perspective we did have a strong Q1. We did have some cost rated Covid-19 was fairly immaterial. I do expect to have additional cost in Q2 that's actually one reason why the Q2 guide is relatively flat even though volume is up. So we had some cost in Q1, we should have a little bit more in Q2, still not super material but it's going to be a few tenths of a points of a headwind in Q2 as compared to Q1, but overall margin is tracking fairly in line with that exception. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. SimonLeopold: Thanks for taking the question. First, I wanted to see if maybe you could help us unpack your enterprise market vertical a little bit in that, I think one of the points you've tried to make is that you've got exposure to generally healthy enterprises. And I am assuming that would be financial services, governments and just if there's some more color you can give us as to the uncertain verticals that you reference in the prepared remarks. Thank you. RamiRahim: Thanks for the question, Simon. So again pleased with our performance in what is a dynamic and competitive environment in the enterprise space. We saw strength in switching, US government performed well; our sales transformation that we have been embarking on over the last year starting to pay off. Mist had a record quarter and the momentum there has been strong. You're absolutely right. I think if you look at our enterprise business and unpack it, we have significant exposure to elements of the enterprise market like federal government, public sector, education, financial services that we believe are going to be more resilient to any economic downturn. The parts of the enterprise market like retail that is probably going to be less resilience we just have less exposure to. SimonLeopold: And just in terms of my follow up, I'd like to see whether you've done anything in terms of actions to help out particularly your enterprise customers. Whether it's financing or more flexible terms on payments. Whether we should expect maybe DSOs become more extended just what are you doing in terms of the response and the adjustment to the shifting environment? Thanks. KenMiller: Yes. So and just to add on to Rami's previous answer, the travel, retail and hospitality, those segments of the enterprise which we think are more exposed that's less than 15% of our total enterprise sales on the average core. So we feel good about our, the exposure levels we have in some of the more resilient enterprise sub segments. On a financing and cash receivable perspective, we have not seen any change to date. We are anticipating some modest push outs of collectibility and perhaps a little bit more bad debt, but to date we haven't seen it. We are aggressively working with customers on our Juniper financing services programs that we do offer leasing and extended payment term programs and we have revamped some of those and are offering those to customers as we speak. And I do expect to see some more traction in that space going forward. Operator : From line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. PaulSilverstein: I appreciate it. Ken, is it -- it's just too much inserting the market to talk about where gross margin and operating margin can go over the next 12- months or so? KenMiller: Yes. I would say there is, in particular on enterprise side and we feel pretty good about our cloud and service provider visibility for the year; really nothing has changed there from where we were 90 days ago, but from the enterprise side it's very difficult to predict the second half and therefore the full P&L. PaulSilverstein: All right. And just two clarifications, if I may, sort of a follow up. So the question I was asked earlier in your comment about strategic insertion opportunities impacting margin and you're giving it, I assume that's a clever way of putting that you're using, understandably using discounting to get into market opportunities. And then you mention exposure to government. Can you tell us how - remind how large government as a percentage of revenue? Appreciate it. KenMiller: Yes. So the strategic insertion opportunities, there's really a couple deals that we have in our Q2 pipeline that are in emerging markets. They'd carry a higher discount and lower margin. These are breaking opportunities. They also have an unfavorable mix where it's heavy on chassis, light on LAN card, so these insertion opportunities are typically lower margin and we expect to recoup some of that margin over time as they add more line cards into the install base of the chassis. And we have a couple of those deals in the Q2 forecast that are impacting margin a bit. I'm sorry second part of the question? PaulSilverstein: Government business and federal revenue. KenMiller: Yes. I'm sorry. So we did break out a couple years back that the US federal government was 15% of total enterprise and that percentage is largely unchanged. That's just the US Federal. We obviously have international federal government, local, state government and other government agencies that are not part of that 15%, but that gives you some sort of order of magnitude there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. IttaiKidron: Thanks. Appreciate it. Ken, I just, I want to make sure you can help me walk through from the first quarter to the second quarter. It sounds like there's about $50 million that you could have shipped that you didn't. Ken, tell me in your guidance for the second quarter how much of that you expect to capture in the second quarter and then with regards to the order patterns, clearly, you had a very good quarter orders, but maybe you could talk by linearity in the quarter, and how do we should we think about orders in the second quarter? And I'm really trying to triangulate and what kind of backlog do you hope to finish the second quarter? KenMiller: Yes. So the linearity in Q2 was actually in line with our normal expectations that across geography kind of across vertical et cetera. So linearity was on track. We already mentioned booking -- I am sorry in Q1. Bookings was stronger than we expected but it wasn't kind of a last week booking, it was really throughout the quarter, we saw strength. We expect most of what we weren't able to ship in Q1 to ship in Q2. We still have certain supply constraints that we are working through, but I feel like most of the backlog we carried in Q2 will ship in Q2. That said Q2, we do believe cloud and SP momentum will continue. So we expect another quarter of strong bookings there. Enterprise is probably the one that has the most uncertainty. We have seen some pipeline softness in our enterprise business. Clearly, we factored all that into our Q2 guide. IttaiKidron: Very good and for, Rami, as a follow up as I try to think about the clouds and the service providers sounds like you have some interesting opportunities there. Is there a way for you to get your hands around how much of that is clearly just a reaction to traffic patterns given everything that's going on? And I am asking more in the context of timing of spend. What are the odds and what you're seeing right here right now? It's just time shifting those customers just saying you're not, we had strong plans for the second half, let's just put them in the first half and then we get to a little bit of our, we're low on gas as we get to the second half of the year. RamiRahim: Yes. It's a good question, Ittai. We obviously took a hard look at this and when we analyzed the numbers and we saw where the bookings momentum was coming from, I'd say that the Covid related orders were there, but they represented a relatively small part of the performance that we saw in the Q1 timeframe. And so let me expand on that a little bit more. In the service broader space, we have had a deliberate strategy over the last few years to diversify not just in the Tier-1 accounts where we have strength and footprint, but in to Tier-2 and Tier-3 and we saw the Tier 2, Tier-3 SPs kick in. We saw good momentum in the cable space for example especially here in the US. So I actually think the diversification of our SP business has helped us more than any Covid related increases in traffic. And on the cloud side, again, I do think that there were certain elements of cloud momentum that were a result of cloud services especially those that were in the business of offering connectivity and services like video conferencing for work from home users, but there the exposure to tier 2, tier 3 that strategy certainly helped us and of course, the hard work over the last couple of years in transitioning our customers to a new scale of product set and as a result of that retaining that footprint has allowed us to be in a position where we can reap the benefits of deployments today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. TalLiani: Hi, guys. I'm trying to understand the source for the strength with cloud and with service providers and also on the enterprise, its kind of the same question. Do you feel that customers had brought in or brought forward demand from future quarters just because of either on the service of either side it could be because of increased traffic, so they just deployed plans sooner than they wanted? And on the enterprise side maybe there was also a concern that the budgets will shut down. So do you see any abnormal behavior of customers that is driving what you're seeing on the positive side is driving the strength in the order you're discussing. RamiRahim: Yes. Tal, thanks for the question and my answer is largely similar to that I just provided to Ittai. Like I said there has been some order patterns especially in cloud and SP that were clearly tied to increase traffic within network as a result of the Covid-19 situation. But in our analysis that is a relatively small portion of the overall performance that we saw especially from a booking standpoint in those verticals. And in the enterprise side, we actually saw sort of a balance of maybe some pull in but also some push out near the end of the quarter in particular, so on average I think it was probably a wash at least in the Q1 timeframe. TalLiani: Got it. Can we talk about, I want to talk it's a bigger question not about the quarter. We hosted many calls recently about white box routing; Cisco launched a product in December. Where do you stand with your position on white box routing and your preparation for this change in this market? RamiRahim: Yes. A good question as well. So we were one of the first established networking vendors to embrace white box routing and switching years ago. We've never resisted the movement. We've actually offered that as a business model to our customers where they can procure software and hardware separately or procure software and deploy on white boxes if they choose to do. So we've had many customer conversations about this over the years and we've actually invested in the architectural principles behind white box routing where we decoupled software from hardware because it makes sense for us to do so irrespective of whether customers embrace the business model. Quite frankly, the uptake, the interest level from customers in embracing it has just been limited. And I think that many of our customers appreciate the fact that we're not resisting it. We're offering it as an option but also appreciate the fact and choose to deploy the simpler model of just an integrated stack whether software running on systems that are merchants silicon-based or software that's running on systems that's custom silicon-based. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. TimLong: Thank you. Rami, I was hoping you could discuss kind of the 400 gig switching into the cloud vertical. Do you think any of the disruptions that we've seen impacts timeframe or Juniper's position to kind of insert into that market? And then I have a follow-up. RamiRahim: Yes. Certainly, Tim. I mean if anything Covid-19 has been a reminder of just how important the performance and the resilience of global networks are to Juniper, but also certainly to the world and the big industry trends 400 gig being one of them, one that we've invested in; one that we're certainly counting on are going to be more important rather than less important as a result of the this pandemic. Your question is around timing, my belief is if there is an impact to timing to the deployment of 400 gig, it will be fairly minimal because I do see that many cloud providers, some of the service providers today are just so focused on deployment in existing network to meet the capacity requirements of those networks that there might be some defocusing from the projects for 400 gig. But that said, I think, if it is an impact it will be relatively small and the opportunity remains large and our ability to compete in our opportunity I feel very good about. TimLong: Okay. Great. And then just to follow up on the service provider side. It sounds like it's pretty diversified business now which is helped and it's not just Covid impact. Seeing the orders being the best it's been in several years, it's probably early to call but how do you feel about this kind of being a turning point for this business where it could turn back into a more sustainable growth business kind of like you saw in the cloud vertical over the past year. RamiRahim: Yes. There are two elements to the diversification in this business that I like. The first is around diversification in customers, geographically and also in segments sort of tier-1 and tier-2, tier-3, but then the second thing that I really like is the diversification of the solutions that we're offering them. So certainly there is traditional routing, but we saw double-digit growth in switching; double-digit growth in security that we sold into the service provider market. And I think that diversity is certainly healthy. We exited Q1 with solid booking, so I actually expect you to see a meaningful sequential recovery. And I think for the full year seeing sort of what we expected sort of mid-single digit declines in service provider probably a good way to think about the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question. AlexHenderson: Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the inability to supply not so much in the first quarter because you think you're pretty clear on that, but rather to what extent you're holding back your expectation for the second quarter. What's the size and nut on the supply chain challenges for 2Q as you're exiting the quarter in your assumed guide. KenMiller: Yes. So we're presuming similar dynamics in Q2 that's what we're assuming when we created our Q2 guide. We're not counting on significant improvements in the supply chain. Lead time started to extend in kind of early February. They've been extended throughout the rest of Q1 and they're currently still extended and I believe that's going to improve over time. Exactly when is still yet to be determined. There's obviously every day we seem to get a different update on what country is struggling to actually get into the factories and produced goods. So we anticipate similar dynamics. Again, we're trying to improve them. We're working very diligently to improve our flexibility and supply chain, but we're not counting on that when we set the Q2 guide. AlexHenderson: So if I'm hearing that correctly does that imply that you're expecting a book-to-bill in the June quarter to continue to be above one as it was in the March quarter? KenMiller: I would say we expect to maintain a healthy backlog as we execute to, as we enter Q2. So I won't comment specifically on book-to-bill, but I do believe our backlog that we've grown in Q1 will remain strong as we exit Q2. AlexHenderson: And just one more clarification on the backlog assumptions. I assume that that's going to continue to be in the routing space and predominantly in the service providers space as we continue through 2Q or is there shift in the mix of the type of business that you're looking at. KenMiller: Yes. It's pretty hard to predict to be honest with you. I mean a lot of us going to do adjust the timing of the orders; the particular components that that we're struggling to procure. So I wouldn't assume it's going to be one vertical or the other in Q2. Clearly, in Q1, it did impact service provider more than the other verticals, but again it wasn't some sort of structural reason; it was just really the timing and the situation that we ran in this last quarter that could very well change moving forward. All lead times are extended not just service provider lead times, in enterprise and cloud lead times; we've also seen an extension in those due to supply constraints. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. RodHall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just come back to the geographic assumptions you're making in the guide. I think if I heard the answer that last question right, when you say similar dynamics, Ken, do you mean $50 million or so of impact in the guide because you assume supply shortages. What do you mean by similar dynamics? I guess just to clarify. KenMiller: What I mean by similar dynamics is, I think, our ability to ship product as compared to what we book will be in similar from a ratio perspective. So based on the linearity that we expect, I think, our ability to fulfill orders on a percentage basis of total orders will be largely in line with what we did in Q1 which would literally right. As we were not able to ship as many orders as we normally do. RodHall: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then if I think about that then in the context of the guide and the geographies, I'm just wondering what do you expect for the Americas? I mean it's grown year-over-year the last couple quarters, so about the same rate, it closes just under 7%. Do you think that's flat or do you think it's down or what are you thinking happens in the Americas and then maybe you could drill into enterprise versus service provider within that context? KenMiller: Yes. So because we saw booking strength across all geographies in Q1 and yet revenue you'll note the only Americas grew the rest of world did not. I do believe that the rest of world has a strong sequential growth opportunity had given the backlog we built in Q1. On the Americas side, there is a heavy cloud focus there. We had a very strong cloud quarter in Q1, expected to remain strong and I expect a quarter you're going to see if some lumpiness there and we do have a more difficult compared Q2 last year than growth will be what we've had the last few quarters. And that will impact Americas, but beyond that, Rod, it's difficult to get into specifics on geographic mix of Q2. We feel good about the overall revenue objective. I do think SP will be up sequentially quite strong and the rest of business as we outlined. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. MetaMarshall: Great. I wanted to dig a little bit into the enterprise market. You had noted that you were kind of seeing a pause in that market, but I just wondered if any of the conversation it kind of turned to cost-saving initiatives. So whether that be SD-WAN projects or whether there have been focused on kind of outfitting Wi-Fi while people were out of the office. And then maybe just second follow-up question on professional services you noted kind of services being down because of professional services sequentially and just should we expect services to grow in Q2 or will the professional services kind of down tick prevent that? Thanks. RamiRahim: Yes. Let me let me answer the first question and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about your question on services. In the enterprise space, I wouldn't actually classify it as a pause in so much as a weakening of pipeline. The outlook and especially over the next immediate few quarters that pipeline we were counting on just softened up a little bit, but actually the momentum as I mentioned in Q1 was relatively strong all up and that's true for both the datacenter side, as well as the Campus and LAN side. Your question around transformation initiatives, enterprise transformations as they pertain to things like when transformation or SD-WAN Campus transformation moving to cloud managed solutions for wireless LAN and LAN, is actually a very good one. I do think there will be some perturbation in the business as a result of economic uncertainty due to Covid in the short term. I also think that as we emerge from the Covid crisis and things normal, I believe that those transformational efforts, especially Enterprise are going to become more important as opposed to less important.  So that's exactly what we have been counting on as a trend that shapes our strategy and where we have been investing. We're not going after the generic wireless LAN and LAN market. We're going after the AI driven, cloud delivered wireless LAN and LAN market and even in the WAN the things we are after is the SD-WAN transformation and I think that the long-term prospects for that part of the enterprise market is actually good. And that's what we're investing in. KenMiller: Yes and on the services front, the business continues to do quite well. We grew a 2% in this first quarter and most of that revenue and the vast majority of that revenue is service and maintenance contracts. We do have a smaller kind of professional services business and in that's out of the business it is a bit lumpy based on when we actually complete services. So really the PS, professional services volatility you're going to see a quarter-to-quarter has to do with just timing of revenue recognition and current quarter as compared to the prior compare whether it be the private quarter or the prior year quarter. So really nothing unusual there. I expect the service business to remain strong the rest of this year and I think the growth rates we've been seeing in the recent past kind of the low single-digit growth rates are what I would expect going forward in aggregate basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. AmitDaryanani: Yes. Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I think it's true for me as well, first one just on gross margins, perhaps I missed this earlier, but sequentially in June, looks like you have some decent revenue leverage but gross margins I think are guided flat. Maybe what are the offsets to that and then the supply chain disruptions impacting you? What - is there a gross margin headwind in Q1 and Q2 as well from there? KenMiller: Yes. So, yes, I do think that the things that are going in our favor sequentially in the Q2 gross margin would be volume. Increase in volume is typically favorable as well as the customer mix as we expect service provider to actually have a nice sequential growth in Q2. Those are both positives. The reasons that while we're guiding to flat is there are a couple offsetting factors. One of which is we've mentioned a certain strategic insertion opportunities in some of the emerging markets that we forecast to LAN in the second quarter. And those are lower margin deals with the opportunity to expand margin over time, but those handful of deals are negatively impacting our forward guide from a gross margin perspective. In addition, we do expect there to be some supply chain related cost due to Covid-19. We're doing everything we can to securing source supply. We're doing everything we can to ship and create the logistics machines that we need to actually deliver products to customers. It's very challenging in today's environment. So some of those -- some of those actions are actually more costly than they would have been in a normal environment. AmitDaryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. If I just follow up on Mist. I think you talked about a couple of metrics that showed a lot of traction that you're gaining over there. I think you mentioned $100 million in bookings if I am not mistaken. Is it a bit to think about the strengths you see with Mist, how much of that is from cross something to Juniper's existing customer base versus net new logo wins for you as you go forward. KenMiller: Yes. Mist had a record quarter and I did say that the customer count grew a 100% year-over-year and standalone bookings have now exceeded a $100 million on an annualized basis on a standalone basis. So it does not include any pull through of other products. So your question is a good one because we're very much now investing in a strategy where Mist, the platform behind Mist, the clouds enabled AI driven platform actually starts to manage and monitor more and more of our enterprise focus. The first one being our EX wired switching platform that happened. We delivered that as a product offering in the Q4 timeframe and we're already seeing meaningful momentum. So while most of the Mist strength has been in just wireless LAN, the component which is due to sort of attached products under the Mist umbrella is becoming increasingly significant quarter-by-quarter. And I think that's going to be a big part of the success story in the next several quarters and years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Internet. Please proceed with your question. JeffreyKvaal: Thank you, gentlemen for taking the question. My first question is fairly a broad one. I think we appreciate now is that customers are compressing three or four years worth of changes into three or four weeks worth of your time frame. What do you see as just some sustainable changes on the other side of this crisis? You talked a little bit about what might be different enterprise to that, what might we see in service provider or cloud. And I preference that by saying there has been some talk that the cloud networks have not necessarily held up wholly as well as the service provider networks have. RamiRahim: Jeff thanks for the question. Well, I will say this, if I think about how well Juniper as a company has been executing in a work-from-home basis over the last several weeks, I think it's eye-opening to see just how well we have done under those extreme conditions. And in many of the conversations that I've had with customers CEOs, CTOs, CIOs many would express the same thing. So there has -- this has been this grand experiment in some ways of trying to determine how well we can work remotely. And the one thing that enabled us to do this is the global network that we Juniper as well as our peers in this industry have had a hand in building over the years. In some sense like the network has almost been taken for granted for the last few years and this has been a reminder of just how important it is. Your question is about lasting effect, and I do think there is going to be a lasting effect. My belief is more meetings will happen after, even after we return to offices. And I'm sure that will happen at some point. There will be more meetings that will be held through video conferencing as opposed to travel. More conferences will be conducted virtually as opposed to conferences that require a lot of travel and people congregating in similar places. And I think that's good for obviously for our business. We're on the right side of that change and specifically when you look at the areas where we've invested. And I just mentioned around enterprise transformation, cloud delivered AI driven et cetera. These are elements of the new normal that I think are going to work in our favor. JeffreyKvaal: Okay. Thanks Rami. And then a follow up would be on the enterprise sales build. I think last quarter, we talked that it was going to be a little bit ahead of what you had previously thought. This time it sounds like you've ratcheted that down a little bit. Can you help us square that circle? RamiRahim: Yes. You're talking about the sales go-to-market investment that we've talked about historically? JeffreyKvaal: Yes. I think yes. RamiRahim: Okay. So we have as you know restructured sales to create an opportunity for us to invest in more quota carrying sellers. I think that started now more than a year ago. We started to see the benefits of that in Q4 and I think they continued into Q1 to the extent that the Covid uncertainty will impact the enterprise market more than anything else. We will monitor and modulate our investments in sales accordingly. So we're going to keep a very close eye on what happens in that vertical. And we won't -- the last thing we want to do is get ahead of ourselves and invest more than what we need to do, but at the same time I think the momentum that we have seen; the differentiation that we have in the market. The strengths of our products and the fact that we have relatively small share and an opportunity to take share even in a more challenging market gives us the confidence that some investment as we're doing today still makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question JimSuva : Hey. Thank you so much and especially for fitting me in as the last question. I think you saved the smartest and handsome for the last question anyway so. I think what I'll do to make it very easy, I'll just ask one question and it's probably kind of both of you can chime in on that just to show my appreciation. When we look at the orders and the bookings you have, is there any change to the historical linearity in the world that we live in now and what I'm getting at is if Juniper had orders that they couldn't fill because there weren't enough parts out there, it's fair to assume that Juniper wants to order a little bit sooner and so your customers probably would have liked to have their product a week or two ago instead of when it was delivered. So I'm thinking about the linearity of the orders; the visibility both on your customer side, as well as your supplier side. Thank you, gentlemen so much. KenMiller: I think at the highest level, we haven't seen a material difference to linearity. Q1 linearity was largely tracking as we would normally expect Q1 linearity to track. That said I do believe there are situations where our sellers and our customers are working together on when they actually need the product. When the time to deploy is currently scheduled and they might be backtracking forward maybe a couple more months and they normally would to place that order. So I do believe there's going to be some of that going forward, Jim. But it's been -- has it been big enough -- has it been enough of that to really move the numbers materially at a macro level. RamiRahim: I would completely agree, have nothing more to add. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. SamiBadri: Well, that means I get to steal Jim's statement. And so I just wanted to clarify one specific thing which is given you saw some supply constraints and that in turn led to less sales generation in the quarter. The real kind of question I have as kind of two parts or is looking for two-part answers. First, as your customers probably didn't have many alternatives so where they went. So for where they went that would be very helpful to understand if they even did choose an alternative vendor. And then the second thing is do you perceive these Mist sales opportunities as potential like catch-up sales opportunities through the rest of the year or even 2021 or should we think of these as just lost sales for the time being and the sharp clock recommences and you guys need to go back and win in the market. RamiRahim: Okay. Sami, so the first question, if I understood correctly in terms of Juniper versus alternative to Juniper and the decisions our customers make. I mean that's not a new dynamic in the industry. This is a competitive industry and we're very comfortable operating in a competitive industry. I did mention earlier in the call and I believe this is true that when you have periods like this where traffic capacities and traffic dynamics are changing and your service providers and cloud providers in particular are supporting a work from home type of scenario. I think that environment favors those cut -- those technology providers that have deployed footprint. And we certainly have a very wide global deployed footprint that we can and continue to take advantage of. On your question around Mist, in the enterprise space in Q1 in particular what we saw was more broadly than just Mist really an enterprise all up and Mist obviously the significant component of enterprises. There were some orders that pushed out in time and there were some ordered that were pulled in and net-net is probably a wash in terms of how that affected the performance of the enterprise business in the Q1 timeframe. KenMiller: The only thing I would add is from the orders and shipments perspective, we had strong orders. We are dealing with extended lead times. We talked about that. Just to give you guys some data there, the average lead time for our product is two to four weeks depending on the product and we've seen that extend by about two weeks. So we're looking at four to six weeks on average as the current lead times. And we've seen that for the last couple months. Customers, if we're working with our customers, we're booking order; we're doing our best to get them the product; the timelines they need. We have not seen customers de-book orders. Customers aren't -- when we aren't able to fill the timeline that we are driving to, we're working with those customers and we're still being able to retain those bookings. So we're not seeing de-booking, they're not shipping from our gear to something else because of supplies constraint at this point, obviously, we continue to look to avoid that type of behavior, but we haven't seen any to date. End of Q& A Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand it back to management for closing remarks. Jess Lubert : Thank you everyone for your great questions. We look forward to meeting and speaking with you during the quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note,, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us during these difficult times. Like many of you on this call, we are continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and taking actions to both meet the needs of our customers and ensure the safety of our work force. Most of our employees are continuing to work from home and successfully leveraging the various technologies enabled by the network to maintain a high-level of productivity despite the current environment. To this last point, the strategic importance of the global network has never been clearer and I believe the long term outlook for the markets we serve remain positive. We are investing to not only survive the current environment, but to capitalize on the opportunities our markets present and come out stronger on the other side. Now on to our results. We delivered better than expected results during the June quarter with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1,086 million and $0.35 respectively, both exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Overall orders experienced mid single digit year-over-year growth with double digit improvements in our cloud and service provider segments more than offsetting a mid single digit decline in our enterprise business. We are entering Q3 with strong backlog and remain optimistic regarding our ability to navigate ongoing supply chain disruption. We are executing well in the current environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic continue to present challenges, we believe we are we successfully meeting the needs of our customers and helping many of them deliver the critical bandwidth required to support the global economy as millions of people around the world work from home and increasingly leverage cloud-based services. We remain optimistic regarding our competitive positioning and our ability to capitalize on some of the large industry transitions that are likely to play out over the next few years. On this last point, I would like to highlight that we secured our first 400 gigs win during the June quarter with opportunities that span across each of the verticals and geographies that we serve. While our initial wins are for wide area use cases, these opportunities represent net new footprint and increased confidence in our ability to deliver the system density, programmability, power footprint and software needed to gain share in both wide area and data center used cases. While our pipeline of 400 gig opportunities is healthy and we are encouraged by recent wins we secured, many of the bigger opportunities we are targeting have yet to be decided. Based on our latest customer conversations, we continue to expect our 400 gig revenue opportunities to begin in earnest during early 2021 and become a more material driver through the course of the year. Despite healthy momentum entering the second half of the year, the macro environment remains very uncertain and our longer term visibility remains limited, particularly with respect to the trajectory of our enterprise business. As a result, we are continuing to offer limited full year guidance and would encourage you to build your model conservatively. Now I would like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with cloud, we experienced healthy results during the June quarter as the business was up slightly and grew for fifth consecutive quarter despite a more difficult year-over-year comp. We continue to see momentum within our customers' wide area networks, particularly for some of our routing products. Order trends remained healthy with good momentum at multiple hyperscale accounts as well as with our Tier 2 cloud customers. Highlighting the increased diversity of our hyperscale business, our largest cloud customer in the June quarter was different as compared to the March period. Based on our Q2 results and recent orders, we still expect to see low to mid single digit cloud growth in 2020, although we would expect to see some seasonality during the September quarter. We maintain strong durable franchises at each of our hyperscale customers and should be well-positioned to benefit from continued capacity growth in the use cases we own. While our service provider revenue modestly declined during Q2, this business continued to be most impacted by our stock supply chain challenges with orders being a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Although we are seeing some COVID-19 related capacity benefits, we believe much of the service provider order strength we experienced is attributable to our diversification efforts across customers and products over the last few years. To this point, we are continuing to see improved momentum with several of our U.S. cable customers as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers in international markets. We are also seeing increased carrier adoption of our switching and security offerings in addition to our traditional routing platforms. We believe we remain well-positioned with our service provider customers and that our continuing efforts to diversify our customer base and increase the breadth of our offering should benefit this business through the remainder of the year. While we acknowledge that some of our service provider customers are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters, based on our recent momentum and customer conversations, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid single digit decline in 2020. Our enterprise business slightly declined year-over-year, but exceeded our initial expectations for the period. Strength in the financial services business as well as with some of our largest strategic accounts more than offset weaker than anticipated results from our U.S. federal business which was impacted by COVID-19 timing dynamics that we expect to reverse during the current quarter. While our overall enterprise business is being impacted by the uncertain macro environment which have caused some customers to reevaluate plans, we are continuing to see very strong momentum with Mist, which is driving an increasing level of confidence in our ability to gain enterprise share and return to growth once the pandemic subsides. To this point, I would like to highlight that Mist reported another record quarter with orders rising more than 170% on a year-over-year basis and new logos increasing by more than 100% year-over-year. Mist has now secured four Fortune 10 accounts and we saw a material increase in demand generation from the channel reflecting the true differentiation of the product. In addition, Mist launched a new software subscription premium analytics that has generated strong interest due to its ability to enable use cases such as proximity tracing, journey mapping and hot zone alerting to help enterprises enable social distancing and keep employees safe as they start returning to work. Our enterprise at home offering also generated strong interest from enterprises due to the increase in work from home. While Mist is continuing to exceed expectations, our strategy to Mystify additional elements of our switching, enterprise routing and security portfolio through the year is helping us take share from competitors and should create incremental pull-through opportunities for our enterprise offering in future periods. Our software revenue declined in the quarter and accounted for less than 10% of sales due to a lower mix of certain products that drive higher on-box attach rates of perpetual licenses. That said, our software orders grew 7% year-over-year due to a combination of strong Mist and security subscriptions as well as our efforts to transition certain perpetual software offerings to term-based subscription. We believe growth in these recurring software offerings is an encouraging dynamic that should improve visibility over time and give us confidence in the long term outlook for our software revenue. I would like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continues to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services margins continued to improve year-over-year and our customer satisfaction rates are currently at record levels. Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2020 at $1,086 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35, both above the midpoint of our guidance range. We experienced strong demand in the quarter with orders growing mid single digits year-over-year exceeding our expectations. Revenue was down 1% year-over-year, as expected supply constraints resulted in extended lead times throughout the quarter. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a sequential basis, all verticals grew with service provider growing 16%, cloud growing 9% and enterprise growing 1%. On a year-over-year basis, cloud grew slightly year-over-year while both enterprise and service provider declined 2%. From a technology perspective, routing and switching decreased 3% year-over-year and security decreased 1% year-over-year. Our services business increased 1% year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, software revenue was below 10% of total revenue for the quarter and declined year-over-year. However, software bookings grew 7% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were cloud, three were service provider and one was an enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.3%, below our expectations primarily due to higher than anticipated COVID-19 related logistics cost. If it weren't for the COVID-19 elevated logistics cost, we would have posted non-gap gross margins of approximately 59.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 3% sequentially, which is in line with our guidance range. Our operating expenses in Q2 benefited from COVID-19 related savings. Cash flow from operations was $98 million. We paid $66 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $2.6 billion, slightly up from the first quarter of 2020. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. At the midpoint of our Q3 guidance, we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and strength within our service provider and cloud verticals. We believe these factors should help offset continued uncertainty in parts of our enterprise market. We expect to see sequential volume driven improvements in our non-GAAP gross margin and a more favorable customer mix during the September quarter. We expect logistics and other supply chain related costs to remain elevated, consistent with Q2 levels due to the effects of the ongoing pandemic. We expect third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to be essentially flat compared Q2 as we continue to benefit from lower travel costs due to COVID-19. We will remain focused on prudent cost management while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. Turning to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend and will remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with the service provider trends. Those are way better this quarter than they have been for many quarters. Actually, the sequential on that is up a lot and the year-over-year down not much. So I wondered if you could dig into that a little bit more, talk about how sustainable that trend is and maybe what drove it a little bit in terms of color? And then I have got a follow-up to that. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks, Rod, for the question. Certainly, we are pleased with the results that we saw for service provider in not just Q2 but in the first half of the year. Revenue doesn't point to the whole story. As we mentioned, orders in the service provider vertical were up double digits. And I think there are a number of different factors. There is an element of this that is COVID related, customers that are trying to deal with an increase in network capacity or customers that are trying to get ahead of any potential for supply chain disruptions. That's an element of it. But I actually think the bigger factor at play here are a couple of things that have to do with the first customer diversity. We have as a matter of strategy been diversifying our reach within the telco segment to Tier 2 and Tier 3. telcos, both here as well as internationally. And then there is a technology diversity element to it. We saw really strong switching momentum among our telco customers and e-security. We have a strong mobile and especially 5G related security solution that's seeing some really great demand with our customers. So certainly, I think that to the extent that we are in a new normal relative to telco spending dealing with capacity constraints, that should last. And there is a meaningful element that's just not COVID related at all and that's really a matter of execution and that's where I just think we are executing really well, Rod. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks Rami. And then on the follow-up, I wanted to ask you guys about the supply chain elongation of lead times and whether, I know you started talking about that last quarter and it continued this quarter and now you are saying they will continue the following quarter. Is it a case now where revenues are kind of normalized for that? Or so we just keep pushing revenue out into the future because of these supply chain disruptions? Or do you think you are actually losing revenue as a result of it? Can you comment on the effect on what we should expect in terms of the underlying revenue trajectory? And if you have got any thoughts on when that might ease in terms of impact to you, that would be interesting as well? Ken Miller : Yes. So we are continuing to manage through various supply chain challenges that we talked about last quarter. Lead time did remain extended throughout the quarter. Normal lead times for us on average is about two to four weeks. We are seeing today's lead times or Q2's lead times, I should say, closer to that four to eight weeks on average level. So you can see the level of extension there. We did see some stabilization, quite a bit of it, towards the end of Q2. We do expect things to stabilize throughout Q3 and actually get better over the second half. We just don't have perfect line of sight as to when those improvements are going to happen. So we are not factoring any improvements into our Q3 guide. However, clearly, the team is driving to get improvements each and every week. So we do expect improvements in the second half, just not factoring it in the Q3 guide, given all the uncertainties involved. From a revenue perspective, I would say, it's a similar dynamic where you saw the bookings growth in the quarter but revenue was modestly down, similar to what we saw in Q1. When we start to actually ship more backlog than we book, you will see revenue growth be faster than bookings. But for Q2, we saw kind of a similar dynamic that we saw in Q1 which is more of a backlog build. Ken Miller : Yes. Just to add, Rod, to the question. I don't believe we are losing as a result of this. There is no doubt, it's a challenging situation. But I don't think it's unique to Juniper and I think our customers recognize that this is an industrywide challenge that we are dealing with here. Couple that with the fact that, these products are not typically interchangeable from one technology provider to another technology provider, depending on the particular use case that you are addressing. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Tim Long : Thank you. If I could just start off with the 400 gig side. Rami, you talked about a win there and some larger opportunity still to come. Could you just give us a sense, as those started to come in or materialize next year, how are you thinking about the breadth of that business and where it will be playing? And curious if you can just give us some of your thoughts on Nokia's announcements to kind of go after this market a little bit more? Does that change the dynamic? And then I have a separate follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thank you for the question, Tim. So 400 gig has been a big bet for us for quite some time. This is an area that we have invested in. And as I have mentioned previously, we have introduced really a brand-new technology stack that includes new silicon technology, systems and we have also revamped significant portions of our operating system to make it essentially cloud-ready for 400 gig deployments. There have been early wins and we are very pleased with that because of the fact that they have been competitive wins. They have been wins that have taken up into net new networks. I know at least a couple of those went into WAN for service providers as well as WAN for cloud providers where they are essentially net new use cases that we have now been selected to deploy. So although they are not all that meaningful yet from the standpoint of revenue for our business, to me the important thing is that it gives us the confidence that that new technology stack that we have brought into the market is working, is working well and is very competitive. So that leads me to the next part of your question around the competition. We are very used to operating in an environment where there are competitors, strong competitors. And I would just say that we are very confident that the technology stack that we have is competitive. We are seeing the early proof points. And then after that, I think the footprint that we have among telcos and the cloud providers that truly gives us the opportunity to leverage to launch into 400 gig use cases and deployments, I think, it's something that we can absolutely use to grow this part of our business. Tim Long : Okay. Great. And then just to follow up on the enterprise side. It sounds like Mist is doing well. You guys have obviously had a good big push there. Just talk, Rami, a little bit about, obviously, the changing dynamic on what the workspace of the enterprise or the campus is going to look like from a number of people? So do you think there is an impact on your growth medium to longer term based on the slope of employee repopulating and the scale to which there is enterprise? Or do you think the growth rate there for you is unaffected? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. It's a great question and obviously one that we thought long and hard about. The net of the answer to your question is that, whereas in the short term, there is going to be some disruption and there is going to be some challenges as a result of the macro situation, I do believe that as we emerge from the pandemic, we will see actually strong momentum and growth, both in the markets that we serve and in terms of the strength of our technology and our ability to take share. And the reason being that, we focused not just on your standard legacy-based enterprise wireless LAN deployments, we are really focusing on an end-to-end solution that includes wireless LAN, LAN and WAN. And many enterprises, even today, are thinking about how to transform their businesses to take into account or to take advantage of these cloud-delivered AI driven solutions. I think our solution here is very strong. Honestly, the win rate is phenomenal, even in this environment. So yes, we saw some weakness in the Q2 timeframe. It was still better than what we expected and I believe we are actually take share on the strength of our portfolio. The last comment I will mention here is, we really are addressing solutions that are very pertinent to what our customers are thinking about today. So our customers want safe return to work solutions that will allow them to understand that there are hotspots in their campuses or if there is in fact an issue with an employee getting sick they can understand where that employee has been and who needs to be notified. These are solutions that really go to the heart of the kinds of problems that need to be solved as a company starts to return to work. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question. Alex Henderson : Thank you. I was hoping you would talk a little about your comment on the enterprise business. Specifically, you stated that the U.S. federal business was well-off in the quarter, but you expected it to rebound and it seemed somewhat countervailing to the trajectory of spending in government and state and local given the clear physical constraints that are developing as a result of the COVID. What gives you confidence that's going to recover and improve in the third quarter? Rami Rahim : Well, the third quarter is traditionally the fiscal year-end for the federal government. So it's typically been a stronger quarter. There is that dynamic. But I think it's more than that. We have obviously had our business reviews and we are looking at our pipelines, we are looking at projects and in all of those dimensions, there are opportunities out there. There are projects out there. We don't believe, although we are monitoring very closely, we don't believe that the projects have been canceled or even moved out in any meaningful way. There has been disruption as a result of COVID to the short term timing of the project. But we still remain pretty optimistic about this part of our business. Alex Henderson : The follow-up question is, obviously enterprise is a very important piece of the puzzle and a driver going forward. Mist is a key piece of that. It looks like your Mist business is booming yet your enterprise business was soft. Is that a function of the timing differential between current revenue recognition and the incremental pull-through? When would the pull-through cast aside post a Mist order? Is that lagged somewhat? Ken Miller : Yes. So the Mist model is, about 60% of the revenue is recognized upfront in the form of hardware and then there is a good amount that's deferred in a SaaS delivered license, cloud delivered license. So there is a fair amount of deferred revenue in a Mist transaction. I would just also highlight, our enterprise business is quite large and has many used cases, data center use cases, campus and enterprise switching, security, routing, et cetera. So while Mist is very fast growing, it is still relatively small as compared to the rest of our enterprise portfolio at this point, but it is growing quite nicely obviously. And it is pulling through other resolutions as part of the Mist sale. Rami Rahim : Yes. And Alex -- Alex Henderson : The question was the timing of the pull-through relative to Mist orders. When orders come in, how long a lead time before you get pull through for other products? Rami Rahim : I see. Yes, first, I can tell you that when we sell Mist, we are really selling a portfolio. I know Mist, when we acquired the company, it was a wireless LAN solution. But when we combined with Mist, we really did it because the strategy was to take that cloud-delivered AI-driven engine and to extend it across our entire portfolio. We started to do that with our wired switching and then now we are starting to incorporate our WAN transformation, our SD-WAN solution. In at least three of the four Fortune 10 accounts that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, those are combined wireless LAN and LAN switching under the Mist umbrella. But when you have a break in, especially in a large account, typically it's a small break in, to begin with. And then you build on it over time. The glue, the real secret sauce here is the cloud-delivered AI driven experience for our customers. Once you have sort of start captured and impressed your customers with that solution, it becomes much easier to scale over time. So I would say, we are early days in terms of reaping the full benefit or the full potential of these solutions. Ken Miller : Yes. It's hard to quantify precisely. But in our models, we think it's a three to six months kind of pull-through effort to really start to see the leverage of the Mist for the rest of the portfolio through. Alex Henderson : That's helpful. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Ittai Kidron : Hi guys. Just a couple questions for me, first on the enterprise. Rami, can you talk about the linearity in the quarter? Was this kind of an even quarter? Or started strong, ended soft? I know it sounded like a lot of the issues you have had with enterprise last quarter seems like a repeat this quarter. I am just trying to understand, from a pattern standpoint, did it end on a positive note or not? Rami Rahim : I think it was normal. I look to Ken here, but I think there was nothing out of the normal in terms of the linearity of the quarter. And as I mentioned, the results that we saw in the enterprise were really as expected or maybe even a little bit better than what we expected, considering the dynamics. It's left to be seen, but based on our win rates and our competitive positioning, I believe we are taking share in the enterprise. Ittai Kidron : Got it. And then as a follow-up from on the software side of that. It was down there and with Mist clearly having a good quarter. Can you help me understand what components of software did not do well? Is that the on-box software that I assume underperformed in the quarter? Rami Rahim : Ittai, let me give you a couple of statistics on our software business. Off-box orders increased by 50% year-over-year. And in off-box, subscriptions orders increased by even more than that, more than 50%. And then SaaS subscription increased by over 85% year-over-year. So the off-box metrics are very healthy. The weakness was entirely a result of on-box flex licenses. And it just so happened that many of the products that we sold in the Q2 timeframe were products that did not yet benefit or don't have the flex on-box licensing component. Ken Miller : Yes. And just to clarify, it was actually some of the on-box perpetual licenses that we sold as disaggregated model. The flex license model is actually ramping within the on-box. Those are the term-based licenses. We are seeing an increase in term-based subscription licenses. But the perpetual disaggregated hardware software licensing scheme that we had in the past, we saw a decline in that model. Ittai Kidron : Just so maybe I can add to that, Ken, on that front. Given that the component that was software perpetual, is there anything to be learned or to deduct from that with respect to the mix of chassis versus blades or something like that? Is there a correlation there between that and your perpetual mix? Ken Miller : It's really not a chassis versus blade thing. Its really a transition from legacy perpetual into more term-based subscription recurring revenue models that we are driving. And we did see good success in those metrics. That's really what's important to us. So we expect to grow software from Q2 as we enter into Q3. Rami Rahim : And just to add, our strategy has always been to grow the number of platforms that will leverage our flex licensing model and that certainly is going to help in the out quarters. Ken Miller : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Proceed you are your question. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about switching business. I know you guys have been working on transceiver development that was kind of feeding into your 400 gig efforts and obviously you are having a bit of success now on 400 gig in terms of customer wins. But can you talk about transceiver development? Where is that? And is it translating at the win level? Thanks. Rami Rahim : The short answer to the translating to our win is no, because it's not actually shipping yet. This is a pretty ambitious project where we believe we have truly differentiated technology that will achieve a level of integration in optical transceivers that is better than anything else that's out there. But it's a difficult project, a challenging project and one that we are working through. Our objective, our goal has always been to release products in time for the ramp of 400 gig next year. And that's what we are working towards. The success, the early success that we are seeing in 400 gig, quite frankly, is based on the merits of our software, our silicon and our system strategy. Transceivers, our optical transceivers, once we ship them would really be sort of an icing on top, not mandatory for our success of 400 gig. George Notter : Okay. Thank you. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Proceed with the question. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the cloud vertical a bit here and have a couple of questions on that. Firstly, you had a good quarter with the cloud customers. But when I look at the product segments there, it seems like the strength really came from routing and sort of switching. So I just wanted to understand what kind of insights can draw in terms of what is driving the spend from the cloud customers with your product there? Is it more of the upgrade of the certain layers that's not really benefiting you on the switching side? I just wanted to understand the dynamics there. And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So just keep in mind that our switching solutions that we sell into the hyperscale cloud provider space are actually used in wide area networks. So this is something that we have talked to you about in past quarter as well. It remains true today. So to think of switching in sort of the traditional sense of switching, it's not really the use case that's deployed by hyperscale cloud providers. All our routing and wide-area use cases within the cloud provider segment, especially hyperscale cloud providers, was very strong. We saw meaningful order strength on a year-over-year basis. And that's, I think, a function of the existing deployments or the footprint that we have and the strength of our portfolio. Samik Chatterjee : And then just following up on the 400 gig win here. I understand it seems like it's one of the smaller cloud providers. But in terms of timing, are you expecting most of the, based on your visibility, are you expecting most of Tier 2 to kind of have a similar timing in terms of their upgrade cycles? And any updates on how you are thinking about the timing for the hyperscalers as well on 400 gig? Rami Rahim : Yes. I believe that it's going to be very much based on the economics and availability of 400 gig optics. And that's very much sort of end of year and really getting to revenue growth next year. So I believe that's true for both hyperscale as well as some of the smaller cloud providers. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani : Hi. Thanks guys. I went back to previous quarters and 2Q is always strong. It was two years ago, it was up 11% sequentially, last year 10% percent, this year 9%. So I am trying to understand why you are focusing on the sequential trends and not on the year-over-year trends? Because last year, the comps were not very difficult. The comps in the year was down 8%, the quarter was down 8% on year-over-year. So the question is, what drives you to be positive given that year-over-year you the growth is minus 1.5% and higher declines of the products? Are there any projects that you are waiting for that are starting to materialize? Or can you link some of the trends you see beneath the surface that maybe the numbers don't tell us? Can you link it to some bigger kind of agendas of carriers like 5G or anything that you can refer to? Ken Miller : Yes. So why don't I start and pass it to you, Rami, to add more color. But a lot of the commentary is based on, as compared to guidance expectations we had when we entered the quarter. Clearly those numbers, those expectations were lowered, as compared to when we entered the year. We absolutely have a long term principle to grow topline and to expand bottomline. That was our expectation this year as well. Not too long ago, but kind of in a pre-COVID world, we felt we were on track for that. With COVID, we do believe that could have a negative impact on our business, particularly in enterprise. And so we reset expectations, if you will. And we are ahead of those reset expectations. I think that's the main takeaway. We did see year-over-year growth in bookings which is a great sign. From a revenue perspective, it was modestly down year-over-year. but the opportunity to deliver against the expectations we have internally now, I feel pretty good about. Rami, do you want to add any more color there? Rami Rahim : Nothing other than just that, you are asking about underlying trends. I think the order strength and the order momentum is that trend, a double digit growth in cloud provider, double digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the service provider segment. And like I said, I think we are executing well in a challenging dynamic environment on the enterprise side based on just the strength of our portfolio. Tal Liani : Got it. I don't know if I have time for another question. But it is your outlook for routing better now than before? And let's COVID aside. Touting has been going under pressure for more than five years, seven years. And the question is whether we have get to a point where routing finally starts growing because there is just a need for bandwidth processing power? Rami Rahim : Well, let me put it this way. We said cloud providers should grow mid single digit for the year all up on a full year basis, not your year-over-year and service provider would be sort of mid single digit decline. We are off to a very strong start in both of those segments. We are not yet ready to change our full year perspective. But let's just say, I am very encouraged by the momentum that we see today. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if maybe you could unpack the cloud customers a little bit. I think I heard you mention in the prepared remarks that the top cloud customer was different this quarter than the last quarter. And what I am really trying to get an understanding of is, what kind of concentration you have within this particular group of customers and maybe the mix of what you classify as Tier 2 versus hyperscale? Just trying to really get down to understanding diversity in that? And then I have got a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes. Let me see how I can answer that. There is always a high degree of concentration when you are talking about hyperscale, just by virtue of the fact there are very few number of hyperscale customers. I mean we measure them top five by their revenue, right, their own services revenue. So within hyperscale, the point that we just wanted to make is, we enjoy really unique solid footprint with a number of them. It's not a one hyperscale customer story. And the fact that in the last couple of quarters we have had two different cloud providers, hyperscale cloud providers emerge as the number one cloud provider customer in particular quarter is, I think, indicative of that. And then there is the broader cloud provider opportunity where we have really focused on broadening our reach into Tier 2, Tier 3 as well as into the large cloud providers in Asia and China in particular, where we have seen some success. So that's how I would respond to your question around the concentration of the opportunity and the diversity of our opportunity. Simon Leopold : And just to clarify, how material would be Tier 2s in that overall cloud numbers? Is it sort of roughly a third of that? Is that the way to think about it? I guess I am looking for how material Tier 2 is? Ken Miller : Yes. We haven't broken down exactly Tier 2 but we have said previously that the top 10 customers account for approximately 80% of the overall vertical. It's a very concentrated vertical. That gives you a good, a pretty good feel for how big our Tier 2 business is. Rami Rahim : And if you were to look at that from the standpoint of what CapEx spend by those customers, it would look probably similar. Simon Leopold : And then the follow-up I had was regarding the MX. You have announced a series of refresh elements, new line cards. And I have the impression that a lot of the certification evaluations maybe took longer than you once expected. And I want to see if you have got a sense of whether or not the completion of evaluations by your service provider customers of MX refreshes is contributing to the improved router growth? If this is sort of what we been looking for? Or if that's still on to come or whether that occurred and didn't really move the needle? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. It's a good question. In both MX and PTX, we saw very strong sequential growth as we expected from a revenue standpoint and we saw solid bookings growth on a year-over-year basis. And yes, part of the momentum in the MX is that we are starting to see a ramp in some of these new line cards that have emerged from the certification phase and they are going into the early revenue phase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Two questions for me. Maybe on kind of the campus business. Have conversation started with customers as to what changes of investments are potentially going to take place if a greater portion of their employees work from home, either additional in-home equipment or less kind of on-campus equipment? And then maybe second question, just on maybe the Tier 2 cloud. Clearly, a lot of those SaaS providers saw a huge increase in traffic due to COVID related instances. And has there been any change in conversation as to whether they will continue to build their own data centers versus leveraging other public clouds? That's it. Thanks guys. Rami Rahim : Yes. Two great questions. First on the campus opportunity. I think there are a couple of things that we should keep in mind. First is, we are focusing on enterprises that are large, that typically have businesses that are going to be more resilient to the pandemic crisis. Government, public sector, higher ed are all, even retail, large retailers that have businesses that are resilient, especially those that are in e-commerce that are resilient to COVID are areas that we are very much deliberately focusing on. And that's helping our business in the current state and I think it certainly will help us post-pandemic. The second element is that many of our customers today are looking for next-gen cloud-delivered AI driven solutions, not sort of the legacy on-prem stuff. They are really looking at transforming their wireless LAN, LAN and WAN solutions. And that's true now and it's certainly true for post-pandemic. And those are the opportunities that we are sort of laser targeting right now and we are seeing some very good success there. On Tier 2 and Tier 3 cloud and sort to shift to public cloud, it's a mixed bag. I think there are puts and takes. There are definitely some Tier 2s and 3s that will, in this time in particular, pivot to using public cloud and honestly will benefit from that through serving the public cloud, the hyperscale cloud providers. But there are a lot of Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud providers that we have benefited from over the last couple of quarters with momentum in this part of our business that are sticking to their own solutions because they believe that's just going to be the most economical way forward for them. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Koontz : Hi. Thanks for the question. Maybe you can comment on your strength in APAC, both year-over-year and Q-over-Q? You have got some fairly easy compares there. But how much of that do you tribute to like 5G programs in Japan and Korea? And then the second question, kind of more broadly, how do you see 5G driving Metro upgrades globally in some of your SPs. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. Great question. So I am happy with our results in APAC. In fact, sequentially all of our geos were up. So we saw good momentum sequentially across Americas, EMEA and APAC. APAC, you are right. I mean it's working off of an easier compare after several quarters of decline. I think we are executing well in APAC. I think Asia-Pacific is also a little bit ahead of the U.S. when it comes to dealing with the pandemic and emerging from the economic turmoil that we are benefiting from. A lot of strength is telco related and I do believe that some of it is 5G related. And in particular to 5G, there are a number of ways that we benefit. One is in transport, whether it would be Metro buildouts or edge and core opportunities. The other one would be in security, where we have seen now for a number of quarters real strength in our security business specific to telcos and especially telcos that are starting to build out their security infrastructure in preparation for 5G. And then the last dimension of success that we have seen, again not just in APAC but really worldwide but included APAC would be in our telco cloud solutions. 5G will be a cloud native solution. Many of the services that will be offered in 5G will essentially be offered in software in a virtualized form. And we have very strong solution for that today that we are benefiting from. Ryan Koontz : Helpful. A little follow-up there on the telco cloud. Are you seeing more of a trend, swinging back towards telco looking to outsource that cloud? We have seen announcements from Microsoft and Amazon there. And how do you see that playing out in the telco cloud? Rami Rahim : Yes. It's also very good question. Again, there I think it's very much a mixed bag. There are going to be some telcos that are comfortable and want to work with the hyperscale cloud providers and again, there I think we benefit in indirect ways. But there is definitely an opportunity that we see where telcos really want more of a, I wouldn't say build it themselves but to partner with technology providers like Juniper and others to put together telco solutions to offer differentiated edge services, where they have the best locations already in their networks available to deliver those services. And that turns out to be an area where we have a lot of experience, some great technology and good momentum with the telco customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thanks. This is Irvin Liu, dialing in from Amit. I had a question and a follow-up as well. My first question is on your off-box software subscription momentum driven by Mist. Can you talk about the originations of some of these sales? Are you seeing these wins from mid-cycle add-ons? Or is this more of an upgrade cycle driven story? And longer term, should we still expect software revenue to trend above 10% of revenue? Rami Rahim : Yes. So on the first question, a lot of the Mist momentum we are seeing are net new wins and net new logos. So there is essentially the introduction of SaaS based subscription services into net new accounts. There are certainly some renewals that are out there. I don't know the exact numbers off the top of my head, but a lot of the Mist momentum has been as a result of the 100% year-over-year growth in net new logos, new opportunities that we are winning. Ken Miller : Yes. On the 10% of the revenue, that's clearly our goal is to grow software over time. We have that goals beyond 10% over the next couple years. As far as going forward, I do expect us to grow in Q3 off the Q2 levels, but really no commitment yet on the 10% going forward, other than, yes, we do expect to get back there and surpass it over time as our subscription business starts to a become more and more relevant in overall software story. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thanks. And I actually wanted to ask about the other technology transition which is the Wi-Fi 6 cycle. Can you share your thoughts on when you expect wireless LAN to become a more material portion of your revenue looking forward? Is there potential for there to be a standalone revenue breakout for wireless LAN on your P&L in the near future? Rami Rahim : Well, that's a homework assignment for Ken. We are not baking it out now. But I will say this, Wi-Fi 6 is a great opportunity for us. We already have our Wi-Fi 6 access points in the market today that are selling. But Wi-Fi 6 on its own, I think is there are going to be many vendors that offer it. AI powered cloud-delivered Wi-Fi 6, because with Wi-Fi 6 comes a certain level of complexity that operators need opportunity to overcome and you want to offer them a solution that's essentially, it runs itself. And quite frankly, there is just nothing out there that comes even close to what we have on that front. So I think we have the right combination of the high-performance Wi-Fi 6 access points as well as the AI driven solutions that simplifies the deployments and the ongoing operations of these solutions that's helping us win large accounts around the world. Jess Lubert : Operator, we are going to take three more questions. Operator : No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you all very much. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the cloud business and the timing of that. At one hand, it sounds as though you have got some pretty good orders teed up, which is nice. On the other hand, we should be a little bit careful about seasonality in September. And I am wondering if you could ferret that out for us a little bit? Rami Rahim : Yes. Let me start and then maybe, Ken, you want to add some color. For cloud all up, what we have been saying is single digit growth for the full year is sort of a good assumption to make. Obviously, we are encouraged by the momentum that we have seen in the first half of the year. That gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to meet if not exceed that outlook that we have provided. And again, I think there is a COVID related element to this, either whether it would be supply chain related or capacity related where cloud providers are actually seeing meaningful growth in their network. But I also think that there is another component which is not small, a large elements of this, around execution, Tier 2, Tier 3 clouds, international cloud, strength of our solutions and the unique footprint that we enjoy with our cloud provider customers. Ken Miller : Yes. As Rami mentioned, we do expect it to be up on a full year basis clearly. That said, we do have a seasonality we have seen it last couple of years where we have seen a little bit of drop in Q3 in our cloud business. We actually expect, obviously, revenue to be up in Q3 at the midpoint of our guidance. If you break it down by vertical, we expect to see growth in service provider and modest growth in enterprise and cloud to be slightly down. Now those numbers could obviously differ from those expectations but that's our current expectation at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you. Rami, in your prepared comments you mentioned an example of some trends or products selling that didn't quite have the typical, I believe, it was you said software attach rate that we are used to. Can you maybe clarify a little bit, is this is a trend that we should expect going forward? Why or why not? Or kind of what happened there? And maybe I just didn't catch the full example that you are giving. Thank you. Rami Rahim : It's entirely based on mix of products. There are some products that we sell that just have a larger term-based software component attached to them than others. And it turned out that we sold more of the product that didn't have that software component. And that might change over time. Ken, do you want to add anything? Ken Miller : Yes. I was just going to say. So we have had a software business for a long, long time that's been largely in on-box perpetual license software business. And it really has additional features and function that we have monetized via Junos. What we are doing now is transitioning that business to more of a sustained subscription business with term licenses or even cloud-delivered SaaS licenses over time. And what we are seeing, depending on what products you buy and how you buy it, you could have differences in the overall revenue for software. And we saw that the on-box perpetual licenses were down, but the rest of the business was actually up in Q2. Rami Rahim : And just to add. Again, our strategy is to make Flex the one licensing scheme for software on-box and off-box across all of our portfolio. That can't happen overnight. We have been working this methodically throughout our portfolio. And over time, as Flex starts to touch all of the portfolio, it will sort of alleviate some of these ups and downs that we see from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint. Jim Suva : Now I fully comprehend it. Thank you so much for the clarification. Rami Rahim : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : I greatly appreciate you all squeezing me in. I am hoping before my cellphone runs out of battery to return to the questions asked by Tal, Simon and some others. First off with respect to routing, service provider routing, in particular, I too once upon a time thought that routing was in secular decline, but looking at the numbers, it's not. I think contrary to what many in investment community were to think, that market actually all-in is growing, albeit modestly. And also for that matter, the same is true of edge and core. You have got 5G impact ahead of you, I suspect in the next 12 to 18 months. Rami, you mentioned tight capacity leading to increased demand among your service provider customers. You have got your new MX line cards that have been in the market now for I think a little over year. They should be ramping. You have got the Ericsson relationship. I assume that that's starting to pay some dividends or whether or not you have got expansion, as you said, of footprint into non-U.S. Tier 2 service providers. But at the same time, you have got Cisco with some pretty impressive, at least on paper, performance in the 8000 family ongoing Nokia strength. So now for the question which is, I appreciate that you all characterize your service provider business, which I assume is mostly routing, not all but mostly routing, I appreciate that you all have been referencing a low single digit decline for some time now. Why isn't there the possibility, given the growth in the market, the coming 5G impact, your new MX line cards, et cetera for that business to return to some semblance of growth, albeit perhaps not dramatic growth?? Or is that just not practical? Rami Rahim : Yes. Paul, look, it's a great question. I think there are a lot of trends coming our way that actually could be tailwinds for us, okay. 400 gig is going to be, there is a service provider element to that. And what I mentioned earlier, around early wins, I mean there are telco early wins that are net new footprints for us in accounts, international accounts in particular where we have relatively little footprint, little deployments. 5G is going to be another area. And that's something that we capture, not just with routing, but with other elements of our portfolio as well. I think the reason why we just are sometimes cautious when we talk about telco business is that telcos in general, the long term trends around telcos is that they are challenged. Their business models are somewhat challenged. They are seeing revenue stagnate. At the same time, they are dealing with growth in their networks. And that puts pressure on their margins. And they translate that pressure into pressure on their technology vendors like Juniper. So we have to be a little bit cautious and careful in the long term modeling and outlook. But certainly, we are doing everything we can from our Metro portfolio to our 400 gig portfolio to our automation solutions for the wide area network to solutions that span into telco cloud and security to capture that telco opportunity. And telco, of course, still represents 45% of our business. So it remains a very important vertical for us. I am very encouraged by the strength of the first half of this year and certainly I would say it's exceeded our own expectations. Paul Silverstein : Rami, before asking the question about margins, my final question, can you just remind us what percentage of service provider is routing and what percentage of routing is service provider? Ken Miller : We haven't updated the numbers, but we did in late 2018 and it was about 80% routing at that time. Paul Silverstein : Service providers, 80%. Ken Miller : Sorry. Service provider is routing. We haven't gone the other direction. But that will help you. That will give you the bit lion share of the routing number. Paul Silverstein : Got it. All right. Ken, I have a question for you on gross margins. It sounds like your third quarter guidance would be something closer to 60.5% to 61% book for the expedite costs. Is that a correct assumption before I ask you the question? Ken Miller : Yes. That is a correct assumption. We saw a 120 basis point in value point and were 1.2 impact in Q2 and I expect similar elevated levels in Q3, so it would be approximately at the same level of impact in Q3. Paul Silverstein : All right. The very basic question is, over the next 12 to 24 months, where can you get your gross margin to in a reasonable best case? Can you remind us of what the key levers are in getting there? Ken Miller : Yes. So we put out, from a model perspective, 58% to 62%. We have been hovering at that kind of midpoint 60% on an annualized basis for the last couple of years. The path to growth is multifaceted, I should say. Clearly, software is a big part of that strategy. And as we shift more of our business to software, especially recurring software over time, that will carry a margin lift for us. We are doing a lot from an engineering perspective and the design per value and value engineering front. We have talked about this in the past where particularly in our switching line up, we didn't have as competitive of cost of goods sold as we thought we needed. We think we have fixed that and we are excited about the opportunity ahead, particularly in 400 gig on that front, making sure we get the cost per bit right. A lot going on in just inventory levels and management and supply chain optimization, et cetera as well as pricing. So it's really not one answer, but a lot of moving parts there. I would say, the biggest headwind that these moving parts are meant to more than offset is going to be just shift in business. Our margin profile for many of our enterprise products are less than our service provider products, as an example. And we do expect enterprise to outpace service provider. So we do need to improve mix of software predominantly as we move forward. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Rami Rahim : Thanks Paul. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn this conference over to your host, Mr. Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone. Like many of you on this call, we're continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and take actions to both meet the needs of our customers and ensure the safety of our workforce. Most of our employees are continuing to work from home and successfully leveraging the various technologies enabled by the network to maintain a high level of productivity, despite the current environment. To this last point, I'd like to reiterate my belief that the strategic importance of the global network has never been clearer and the long-term outlook for the markets we serve remain positive. We are investing not only to survive the current environment, but to capitalize on the opportunities our markets present, and to come out stronger on the other side. Now on to our results. We delivered solid results during the September quarter with revenue of $1.138 billion exceeding the midpoint of our guidance due to better-than-expected results in our service provider and enterprise verticals, both of which grew year-over-year. Upside in these areas, more than offset some lumpiness with our cloud customers. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 was in line with the midpoint of our forecast. Orders once again exceeded our expectations, particularly in our enterprise business, which saw double-digit order growth year-over-year, despite the challenging macro backdrop. We're executing well in the current environment. We firmly believe we are taking share, and that our technology differentiation along with our investments and go-to-market are enabling us to win at a time when challenging market conditions have adversely affected our competitor. Our momentum is strong entering our fiscal fourth quarter, and this momentum is increasing my confidence that we will be able to grow the business on an organic basis for the full year 2021. With that said, I'd like to touch a bit on our strategy and some of the actions we are taking to win the next decade of networking. Specifically, at the beginning of this year, we focused our sales teams, product management teams and engineering teams on compelling and differentiated use cases, targeting the AI driven enterprise, automated WAN solution and cloud-ready data centers. We believe each of these use cases is likely to see very attractive market tailwinds over the next several years. And focusing our resources on these specific areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. It's worth mentioning that each of these use cases span across the three industry verticals that we target, and by focusing our resources on these areas, we should have the opportunity to speed time to market, accelerate share, and leverage development costs across a wide base. While this alignment should position us to better capitalize on big opportunities like the move to AI driven cloud managed architecture, 400 gig and 5G in the years to come, the early feedback from our teams has been incredibly positive, and we\u2019re already starting to see the benefits of this alignment, which you'll hear me discuss more in future calls. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with the enterprise, we are particularly encouraged by the improved momentum we're seeing as this business experience double-digit sequential growth and slightly grew on a year-over-year basis. We saw improved momentum in the U.S. and Asia, which more than offset weakness in Europe. Order growth was solid and exceeded our expectations, particularly in the North American enterprise and U.S. federal vertical. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share, a dynamic we expect to continue in the future. Our optimism is fueled by the customer response to our AI driven enterprise vision, which we began executing to early last year. This effort started with an investment in go-to-market headcount, and it was followed shortly thereafter with the acquisition of Mist Systems. These moves have not only enabled us to broaden our reach, but also added some game-changing AI and cloud management technology, which we are extending across our enterprise portfolio. The Mist Technology is truly differentiated and has enabled our customers not only improve network performance, but also to capture material operational savings and deliver significant improvements in end user experience. The differentiation of Mist, which has been extended to our wired offering, can be seen in the order of momentum I mentioned this quarter. To this point, Mist reported another record quarter with new logos once again growing more than 100% year-over-year and orders rising more than 180% year-over-year. We also saw a very strong adoption of our Mist Wired Assurance capabilities and corresponding pull-through of our EX switching portfolio, which positively impacted orders in the Q3 timeframe and should benefit revenue on a go-forward basis. To this point, joint Mist and EX orders exceeded $200 million annualized run rate in the Q3 timeframe. Our investments in go-to-market are beginning to payoff, and we are also seeing positive momentum in the channel, both of which are creating optimism that the success we have been seeing is likely to continue in future quarters. Our agreement to acquire 128 Technology represents the next step in our AI driven enterprise evolution. 128 Technology is truly unique and offers customers material benefits over any alternative SD-WAN solution today. Some of the benefits include much lower hardware costs, much lower latency and significantly lower bandwidth costs. In addition to these benefits, customers will see application performance improve and users will receive a better overall experience. 128 Technology user-centric SD-WAN is a perfect complement to our AI driven enterprise solution, delivering market leading insights and automation from clients to cloud. I expect our enterprise momentum to build in accordance to come and believe this business is positioned to not only grow organically and take share in 2020, but also in 2021 and beyond. Our service provider segment also saw very healthy results in the September quarter, growing 5% year-over-year, despite ongoing challenges from a supply chain perspective. Although we are continuing to see some COVID-19 related capacity benefits, we believe the primary driver of the service provider strength we are seeing continues to be our efforts to diversify this business across customers, products and geographies. Similar to Q2, we continue to benefit from the strength with our U.S. cable customers as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers in international markets. We also saw solid demand for our switching products in addition to our routing solutions. While we did see some weakening in our SP security business, we believe this was a function of timing. I would note that the pipeline here remains strong. Our diversification efforts are only likely to strengthen as we increasingly target access aggregation and metro routing opportunities, and introduce new software-centric testing and automation capabilities acquired through Netrounds that further enhance our ability to win in these growing areas of the routing market, where historically we hadn't played. Based on Q3 results and Q4 pipeline, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid single-digit decline in 2020. While we acknowledge some of our service provider customers that are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters based on our recent momentum and customer conversations, we believe this business has the potential to further stabilize in 2021. Our cloud business came in slightly weaker than we originally expected. We believe the decline on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis was largely a function of lumpiness following five consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. We believe this lumpiness reflects normal customer consumption patterns. Our Cloud backlog remains healthy and we believe the general spending outlook from a hyperscale and Tier 2 customers remains favorable. We believe we are holding our win footprint and are increasingly optimistic regarding our potential to gain data center share in the years to come, while we now believe our Cloud business is likely to be flat to slightly up for the full year 2020. We remain confident in our ability to grow this business in 2021 and beyond. Importantly, we're continuing to make progress on 400-gig with additional wins and strong pipeline of opportunities in both our Cloud and Service Provider segments. While many of our wins are addressing wide area of use cases, where we are historically been strong, we've also secured net new Switching opportunities including a design win with a Top 10 cloud provider. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide area of footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers in years to come. We continue to expect the 400-gig opportunity to begin in earnest next year with the revenue starting to become material during the second half of next year. Our Software revenue represented less than 10% of sales for the second consecutive quarter, due to a lower mix of certain products that drive higher on-box attach rate of perpetual licenses. That said we continue to see strong adoption of our Mist and Security subscriptions and our efforts to transition certain perpetual software offerings to term-based subscription are beginning to drive improved results. We believe growth in these recurring software offering is an encouraging dynamic that should improve the visibility over time and give us confidence in the long-term outlook for our software revenue. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewal and service attach rates. Our Services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you Rami and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2020 at $1.138 billion in revenue, above the mid-point of our guidance range. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 was in line with the mid-point of our guidance. Revenue was up slightly showing year-over-year growth for the first time this year, while lead times improved on a sequential basis, we continue to experience supply constraints and lead times remain extended on certain products due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a sequential basis, Service Provider and Enterprise grew while Cloud declined as expected. On a year-over-year basis Service Provider grew 5%, showing year-over-year growth for the first time in 13 quarters. Enterprise grew slightly and exceeded our expectations. Strength in our Service Provider and Enterprise verticals more than offset a 7% year-over-year decline in Cloud. We saw revenue in all geographies grow on a sequential basis. From a technology perspective on year-over-year basis, Routing increased 6%, while Switching decreased 5% and Security decreased 23%. Our Services business grew 4% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 34% in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.0%, which was below our expectations primarily due to mix. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to COVID-19 we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which was in line with our guidance range. Our operating expenses in the third quarter benefited from COVID-19 related savings. Cash flow from operations was $116 million. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the quarter. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the third quarter of 2020 was $2.6 billion, essentially flat from the second quarter. Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our investor relations website. As a reminder, our guidance includes the impact of the acquisition of Netrounds but excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of 128 Technology. At the mid-point of our Q4 guidance we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum. Our Q4 forecast assumes sequential growth in our Enterprise and Cloud verticals and a slight sequential decline in Service Provider. We expect to see sequential volume-driven improvements in our non-GAAP gross margin. In addition, we expect logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the effects of the ongoing pandemic to remain elevated but slightly lower than Q3 levels. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense to be modestly up from Q3 levels. We will remain focused on prudent cost management while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. We expect non-GAAP Other Income & Expense, or OI&E to be an expense of approximately $15 million on a net basis in Q4 and remain at this level in future periods. The expected negative impact on OI&E is due to the lower interest rate environment, our capital return initiatives and recently announced acquisitions. Turning to our capital return program, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the fourth quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend and will remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks. While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2021. Presuming no further COVID-19-related economic deterioration, based on the current momentum we are seeing and the investments we are making to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, we expect to return to organic revenue growth on a full-year basis in 2021. Assuming the pending acquisition of 128 Technologies closes, we expect nearly a point of additional revenue growth, which we would expect to be weighted towards the second half of 2021. We expect full-year 2021 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, up from 2020 levels. The improvement is expected to be driven by increased volume, software sales and our value engineering efforts. We also expect to see a gradual reduction in COVID-19 related costs through the course of 2021. As a reminder, our gross margin tends to be seasonally lower in Q1, with gradual volume-related improvement throughout the course of the year. We expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately flat year-over-year as improved gross margin will be offset by increased costs related to the pending acquisition of 128 Technologies, the gradual normalization of COVID-related savings, and targeted investments to capitalize on growth opportunities ahead. Due to lower cash and investment balances, combined with lower investment yields, we expect a negative impact to non-GAAP OI&E in 2021. We expect non-GAAP EPS to grow slightly faster than revenue. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hey, guys. Nice quarter. A couple of questions for me. First on the switching side, you've talked about the progress clearly of your campus, which is we\u2019ve missed that you're seeing a pull through, but the overall category was still down 5%. Should I interpret this to mean that the data center switching was weak in the quarter? If you can give us some color around that. And then second question is around the macro. i mean, clearly you sound more confident here heading into towards the end of the year, and that's great to hear. But we are starting to see second wave kind of shutdowns happening in Europe, here and there on a selective basis, perhaps not as extensive but nonetheless happening in Europe. Can you give us some thoughts on what are you hearing from your people over there and how you've incorporated that potential risk into your outlook? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ittai. I'll address both of your questions, and maybe Ken will add some additional color on the macro question. The short answer to the switching question is that, no, actually data center momentum has been quite strong for us. So why is it that we saw 5% reduction or year-over-year decline in revenue for switching, it's entirely or the vast majority of it is due to the dynamics around large hyperscaler deployment of our switching technology in wide area use cases. If you look at our switching performance in the data center for both enterprise and service provider, it's actually up and up meaningfully. So we're actually quite encouraged with the products, the technology that we're offering as well as the momentum we're seeing in the market. And I think our focus on solutions for the data center in both the telco and the enterprise is actually paying off for us. On macro, certainly we're not immune to major disruptions, second wave issues and so forth. But thus far we have been quite encouraged with the momentum, the order strength we're seeing in all of our verticals business, particular in service provider and the enterprise in the Q3 timeframe. I think at this point our visibility is good enough to say that in the service provider space we can see mid single-digit declines all up for the year, which is actually meaningfully better than last year. In the enterprise expect to see growth for the full year now based on the momentum and the visibility that we have, and cloud provider, flat to low single growth is actually very much realistic, again, considering the momentum today as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And Ken will add. Ken Miller : Yes. I mean, I would just add, to 2021, obviously there's a fair amount of uncertainty. But our current working assumption is we're presuming no further economic deterioration and the macro environment remains roughly the same in 2021 as it did in 2020. So we're not presuming it gets materially worse nor materially better throughout 2021. That's really our base case assumption right now. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck, guys. Thanks. Ken Miller : Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Thank you for the question. I have two actually regarding kind of forward sales. So I wanted to ask you what the ACX pipeline is looking like. And if you were to gain footprint wins there, particularly in Europe, what you think the timing on that might be? Would it be middle of next year? Would it be earlier? Just kind of curious how that sales pipeline is developing for ACX. And then secondly on higher speed MPC line card, I wonder, could you talk about how far through the upgrade process you are out there? Like how much runway you think you've got in terms of higher speed MPC upgrade? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the questions, Rod. So both questions are actually pertaining to our automated WAN solutions use cases that we're addressing. In the ACX specifically, this is a product that addresses our metro end-to-end use cases. We're still in the early stages of completing that solution. And what we have is the initial ACX product or modern product that we just introduced into the market, the ACX710; that actually has very encouraging early momentum. That coupled with some of our MX portfolio, some of our older ACX product line, and very importantly here is the solution that we're gluing together with end-to-end automation through some of our organic efforts, smart partnerships and then very recently our acquisition of Netrounds, which is an end-to-end assurance solution for our service provider customers in particular. I think that's starting to come together and we're starting to see early momentum, but it's still early days. And I expect that by the time we get into next year, probably second half next year, we'll have enough of the solution that we should see a bit more momentum. On your question around MPC, it took us quite some time to get the MPC products that we had introduced into the market now a while back. These are line cards for the MX product line complete in terms of the features required for use cases that the majority of our service provider customers were interested in. That's mostly behind us at this point. Then there's a certification cycle. Now we are actually starting to see some decent revenue ramp still early, but I expect that to continue to benefit us in the future. And in fact, some of the optimism we have about further stabilization in the service provider business is a result of the fact that we have these newer products that we're now selling to our customers. Rod Hall : Do you have any percentage sort of estimate on how far through that revenue opportunity you're on the MPCs, Rami? Or I mean, is it sort of 10%? Or is it \u2013 are you further through it? Can you give us any idea? Rami Rahim : All I will say at this point is that it's still fairly low as a percentage of total MX business, whether it's orders or revenues, still very low. Rod Hall : Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : Thanks guys for taking the question. Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of pricing in both the service provider and the cloud markets? And also a broader question for both of you in terms of the competitive dynamics that you're seeing your position relative to \u2013 obviously relative to Cisco, but also relative to the other competitors out there in particular and switching Arista and HPE, I recognize it's an awfully big market and you're still a small part of it. So you may not be coming across \u2013 the competitive aspect may be less rather than more, but I am curious what you're seeing and I have a follow-up. Ken Miller : Yes. So I'll touch on the pricing part and pass to Rami for the competitive aspect. But on the pricing front, we're not seeing a material change, Paul. I mean, as you know, the pricing has always been competitive in this industry. You do see price erosion on a per bit basis, year-to-year, and we're not seeing anything unusual in the pricing curve going forward. So really nothing to note from a chain perspective on the pricing front this quarter nor in our future plans. Rami Rahim : And just to answer your question, Paul, about the competitive dynamics. I mean, we obviously have always been in a very competitive environment, competitive landscape. I like to think about our competitive differentiation from a use case standpoint. So if you look at the AI driven enterprise, where Mist is this overarching cloud solution that delivers manageability and assurance to enterprises, I really am very pleased with our win rate. The fact that we have a solution that is highly differentiated, that's resonating with many of our customers. And especially in a macro environment that is more challenging, in the enterprise space, having this kind of differentiation is essentially what is resulting in the momentum that we're seeing in the enterprise with double-digit order growth on a year-over-year basis. And second to solutions, automated WAN solutions in particular, which is around service providers, cloud providers. I really think that we have a compelling portfolio of products, especially for the 400 gig space with our network operating system capabilities with Junos Evolved, and an automation framework that includes things like HealthBot and NorthStar SDN controller, and now Netrounds, that's really coming together nicely. Metro, that's going to fill out in time. I just answered that question as that's an area where there are going to be some certain select opportunities that we can compete based on the completeness of our portfolio today. But I feel confident with the investments that we're making now that it's going to become a much easier opportunity for us to capture in time as we build out that portfolio. Cloud-ready data center momentum there is really strong again, based on the merits of our merchant and custom silicon based products, as well as the automation solutions that we offer our customers today that actually will even get stronger in time. But I feel very good all up about the technology that we're offering, the customer engagement that we have across all of our segments. Paul Silverstein : And Rami, just to be clear, you alluded to in your remarks, but the weakness you're citing with cloud that is not due to share loss or due to intercepted deals by your competitors. You're not seeing that. Rami Rahim : No, that's not what we are seeing. It's really just timing of deployments across a few of our large cloud provider customers. And if I look more broadly at our cloud segment into Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud, actually the momentum there is quite solid. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to touch up mainly on the quarterly results and just put into perspective some of the other results that you guys have reported earlier this year in 1Q and 2Q. Just maybe if we could get an idea, you talked about in prior quarterly results how there were some unfilled opportunities mainly tied to do \u2013 mainly tied to supply shortages. Now, when we look at the 3Q results and we think about the roadmap for 4Q, how much of 3Q and 4Q would catch-up from opportunities that were missed in 1Q and 2Q or just were a bit behind? And how much of this is essentially net new or I guess you'd say more productive sales generation rather than just like fulfilling orders that were already in the pipeline that never got executed in the first half of 2020? Ken Miller : Yes. So we're very pleased with the Q3 results from a revenue perspective and from a booking perspective. We did see significant bookings growth in Q3 in enterprise. We also saw modest bookings growth in service provider in Q3 as well. There is some of the revenue, particularly some of the service provider revenue in Q3. I would say it did benefit from the strength in first half bookings. The supply constraint still remains elevated on particularly our service provider products; actually our MX and our PTX products are where we're still seeing the most significant supply constraints. We do expect those to moderate here as we close out the year. The rest of our portfolio was largely back on track to normal lead time. So if you look at the quarter result in Q3, from a service provider perspective, revenue growth \u2013 the large sequential increase, there was some benefit from first half bookings, but I would note that even Q3 standalone service provider bookings were up on a year-over-year basis. So we're seeing pretty broad based momentum. I wouldn't over rotate on the first half\u2019s results of bookings being the reason why we had a strong Q3. Sami Badri : Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. You're guiding to EPS growth being modestly ahead of your top line revenue growth, and there are some moving pieces of OI&D. I\u2019m just hoping to get some more color on EPS. Given margins are essentially also basically flat in 2021, your operating margin guide. Does this mean that there's going to be a pronounced buyback taking place in 2021? Or is there something a little bit more \u2013 something very similar to what you guys have done historically in the quarter and end of the year? Ken Miller : Yes. At this point, we don't have anything specific to talk about on 2021 as it relates to capital return program, other than we will remain consistent with past practices. We will return greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We\u2019ll remain opportunistic. We don't have an implied large buyback baked into our current P&L outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, just two, if I could. First, maybe Rami, if you could talk a little bit about you mentioned a good traction for 400 gigs switching. It sounds like you secured a new top 10 customer. Talk to us about the timeline of a more significant ramp and maybe some larger customer wins in that vertical. And then secondly, if you could just double click a little bit on the security piece, looked a little bit weak in the quarter. It's kind of lagged a little bit this year, so maybe if you can highlight what's going on there and what it'll take to turn that business around into next year. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the questions, Tim. I'll address both. So on the 400 gig side, I have confidence in the technology, and there's a lot of new technology that we've introduced into the market here. If you consider new silicon, that's 400 gig capable; new systems that are optimized for 400 gig and a vastly enhanced operating system that we call Junos Evolved. So that momentum that we're seeing is mostly been in the wide area, but we are starting to see some success in the data center. And the thing that I liked the most about this is that it gives us an opportunity to prove out the competitiveness of our product portfolio. And all of these wins involve some level of competition. It hardens our new technology stack and ensures that we're ready for more and more customers as the opportunity expands. Timing wise, I think, meaningful revenue will be next year sometime and in particular in the second half of the year. And then on the security front, our business is very tightly aligned to our high-end portfolio. That's where we have a real \u2013 a pretty high level of differentiation relative to peers in the industry. And that's tied to cloud provider and service provider purchases. In the service provider space, many of the security deployments are for 5G networks or networks that are gearing up for 5G traffic. So it just so happened at Q3 after a couple of actually solid quarters, Q3 was a little bit weaker because of the timing of some of these deployments. If I look at the pipeline, in particular, in the high-end, it looks very solid. So I'm actually not too concerned about the performance in Q3. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off by seeing if you could flesh out the organic growth guidance for next year, a bit more by verticals, and particularly how you're thinking about the magnitude of growth when we kind of look at cloud and enterprise verticals separately. And what are you baking in terms of further award wins, for example, with cloud customers in that outlook? I have a follow-up. Ken Miller : Yes, sure. So while there still are some uncertainties out there, we do believe based on the momentum we have and the investments we're making, that we will return to organic growth next year on a full year basis. We're comfortable with current street estimates, looking for low single-digit organic growth in 2021. From a vertical perspective, we expect enterprise and cloud to be growth drivers for us, and we expect further stabilization within service provider, and it news all kind of organic statements. Clearly, the pending acquisition of 128 Technology as we mentioned last week should add nearly a point to revenue growth on a full year basis in 2021. And we expect those trends likely to be stronger in the second half of 2021, if that's still a very much a ramping growth business. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. And when I think about kind of the stabilization, which you're sounding more confident about for the service provider outlook, I think there's generally broader concern in the investment community that the outlook remains for a decline on a more structural basis there, even if it's closer to kind of stabilization. Can you address that? Like once you get past even 2021, do you see a path back to growth for the service provider business? Rami Rahim : I think longer term there is a path to growth, but we're not talking about 2021 at this point. The thing that gives us confidence in our ability to further stabilize this segment, which would of course be improvement to this year, and this year is actually significant improvement to what we saw last year is execution. And in particular, it's the diversification in how we're approaching this market segment. Diversification from a technology standpoint where it's not just about selling routing into the wide area, it's also about selling switching for telco cloud data centers, as well as security for 5G deployment, and then its diversification from a customer NGO standpoint. So we took some bets with our account coverage, our sales transformation that we took a couple of years ago that are starting to pay off with international momentum in the telco space with accounts that traditionally have not bought much from Juniper, if anything at all. And we're starting to see some really encouraging momentum in verticals like the cable segment, both here, especially here in North America, but also to some extent internationally. So that is a matter of strategy, it's a matter of execution that gives us the confidence in the outlook. Ken Miller : The only thing I would add is that diversification strategy that Rami mentioned from a service provider perspective, it absolutely applies in our other verticals as well, but we're seeing significant diversification in our Cloud business both, Tier 2, different logos on the hyperscalers and more use cases as well as obviously Enterprise is a very diverse vertical for us going forward. So I think universe diversification has absolutely been paying dividends for us here over the last few years. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. First, I just wanted to maybe get a bridge clarification on the strength in service provider this quarter. How much of this do you consider the catch-up from the supply chain issues and how much maybe is coming from the exceptions of the product refreshes like vMX-5G and really what I'm going for is sort of what was catch-up versus what's more organic in terms of trends in service provider? And then I've got a longer term follow-up. Ken Miller : Yes, so I would say the majority is as Rami mentioned is execution related. It's our ability to diversify away from certain Tier 1s into broader Tier 2 internationally as well as other verticals like cable. So I really believe execution is the primary driver of our success within service provider. There was a little bit of catch-up if you recall, Q1 we did miss expectations due to supply constraints that hit us late in the quarter. I think that was about $20 million to $30 million of kind of miss in Q1 that has probably been spread back into the Q2 and Q3 results. At this point, I feel pretty good that our supply constrain while still elevated, it is we're not losing ground nor we are necessarily gaining much. It's relatively consistent, particularly on the service provider vertical. Rami Rahim : Yes. The only thing I will add here is just keep in mind our position among service provider is internationally. We are obviously deployed in many service provider networks across a variety of use cases and where we are deployed, typically there are empty slots in systems that are ready for upgrades when there are capacity requirements and we're constantly innovating and introducing new line cards like the latest MPC line cards for vMX that offer our customers a very easy inexpensive upgrade path to meet those capacity requirements and that certainly is something that's benefiting us today. Simon Leopold : And then I wanted to see if maybe you could elaborate on longer-term objectives for your position in the campus environment. If I look at your campus switch share according to some of the third-parties, it's bounced around 2% to 3% range. And we certainly have heard some more comments in the channel checks about improved momentum of brand awareness. I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, thinking longer term, where do you want to take this business? How, \u2013 whether its market share, revenue objectives, could you quantify what the longer term plan is around your campus position? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Absolutely. So if you look across LAN, Wireless LAN and let's include WAN as well, Enterprise WAN or SD-WAN, that's a $20 billion market opportunity, and we're actually not interested in that full opportunity. The part of that opportunity that we're interested in is the fastest growing part, which is the cloud-delivered, AI-driven opportunity. That's what our AI-driven enterprise solution is all about, where we want to offer the industry\u2019s best clients to cloud solution that includes everything from the end user, irrespective of whether they're in the office or at home or wherever through their wireless WAN, LAN and through the WAN to their favorite cloud. That focus \u2013 that hyperfocus and the investments that we've made on that client to cloud solution is what is paying off for us right now with a very high degree of differentiation. Our objectives in a nutshell is growth is faster than market and that's exactly what we have seen \u2013 what we've been seeing for the last several quarters. In terms of longer-term aspirations, I would just say maybe this will be a little bit of a teaser. We'll do an analyst event in the first half of next year, and we can provide you with additional color on longer-term aspirations, but let's just say, if it doesn't come across clearly on this call, I'm very excited about this opportunity as well as our ability to take share. Simon Leopold : Okay. I'm looking forward to the event to get some numbers behind it. Thank you. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question, two for me as well I guess. I guess first-off, when I think about this low-single digit growth organically in calendar 2021, is there a way to think about it, is the growth going to be fairly even through the year, it's going to be more H1 heavy or not. And then to the extent that growth happens, is the expectation for that coming from a better macro environment or share gains, it does seem like you guys are picking up more share versus not the last few quarters. Ken Miller : Yes. So from a seasonality perspective, I would expect it to be largely similar to this year on an organic basis. I do think the acquisition, as I mentioned before, of 128 Technologies will probably be more backend loaded, so that incremental near the point of growth would probably be more backend loaded, but from a Juniper organic perspective, I don't see the pattern changing much typically would go down obviously from Q4 to Q1, and then we build gradually throughout the year and I expect that to happen next year, as well. Sorry, what was the second part of the question? Amit Daryanani : Yes. It\u2019s something the expectations for calendar 2021, are these more driven by, we think the macro is going to be more better next year or share gains that seem to be helping you. Ken Miller : Yes, it's absolutely about share gains. I mean, we're expecting the macro economy to be largely the same as I mentioned earlier, it's highly uncertain. However, we feel about the momentum we have and our presumption that the economy remains roughly the same. We don't see further deterioration. We expect to see organic growth. I believe many of our competitors are not going to see organic growth. So I expect us to take, share like we have been this year, I expect us to continue to take share next year that's our current working assumption. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just follow up, AT&T recently talked about the ability to start using white boxes for call routing solutions disaggregating the core layer, if you may. I\u2019d love to get your perspective, how do you think of that dynamic and does that expand the competitive landscape in the call routing market and how does that impact Juniper? Rami Rahim : Yes, so I'll take that. We obviously have a lot of respect for AT&T they remain a great partner and customer of ours, having said that I'll talk about disaggregation and white box more broadly. And my perspective here largely has not changed all that much. I\u2019d look at the architectural side, the technology side of disaggregation and Juniper has actually already invested quite heavily in disaggregating our operating system, because it gives us a tremendous amount of benefit. It gives us flexibility, it gives us the ability to reap the benefits of having merchant silicon offerings and custom silicon offerings, and even offering our routing protocols DAX and so forth on x86. That is actually something that we've done because it benefits us. We've also taken the step of offering some parts of our products especially in the switching area in a disaggregated forum where customers can procure our network operating system independently of hardware and quite frankly, the general interests has been weak. So I think the vast majority of our customers are looking for integrated solutions. They want the openness and that flexibility between software and different hardware types, which we can absolutely offer. They want to procure services for the entire stack of technology that includes software and hardware. And if things were to change and more customers start to ask for some sort of disaggregation as a procurement model, it will be ready, because we made the investment. The only other thing I will say is, we have disaggregated components of our OS, our operating system like our routing protocol stack. And we call this for example, cRPD, containerized routing protocol daemon and we've offered it as a separate entity on our price list. And on that kind of disaggregation, we're actually seeing some very robust interests and the deployment models here are all over the place. You can put them in servers, you can put them on white box which is, but all of this is a net new opportunity for us. I don't see this as being cannibalistic in any way. They tend to be very different use cases than the kind of use cases that we serve today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well. I wanted to start first on the 400-gig opportunity. I think last quarter you announced your first 400-gig win. This quarter you talked about a Top 10 cloud customer. Can you just give us a framework of how much of a pipeline, how many wins you've had on the 400-gig, but has there been any timing change or shift out in your expectations of materializing revenue contribution? Because, I think the last quarter you alluded to maybe starting in earnest in early 2021? And then I have another quick one. Rami Rahim : Yes. So in terms of the number of wins, I actually don't have that number right now. We can look to provide you that number in future quarters or at the analyst events in the first half of next year, but it's growing. And in many cases it's either growing with native 400-gig ports that are being deployed today based on the availability of optics or customers are buying 400-gig ready products using breakout cables and things of that nature to get 100-gig connectivity today, but with anticipation that they will eventually deploy 400-gig with the right optics. So I'm honestly quite pleased with the rate of growth this early in the game, across both SPs and cloud providers in this space. And as far as timing, I do think COVID has impacted the timing of 400-gig deployments in particular in the cloud provider space, but to some extent in the service provider space as well, but I don't think it's all that significant. I mean, I still think the ramp is going to be next year, I just think that the meaningful ramp will be more in the second half of the year. Aaron Rakers : That's helpful. And then as a second question, just remind us again of how you see the 5G opportunity. As we start to hear Verizon talk about their base station deployments, really starting to ramp up and obviously we move into the next year. I'm just curious of how Juniper sees it from a core network infrastructure side and when that might start to benefit your Service Provider business? Rami Rahim : Yes, absolutely. So obviously given our position with telco this is a very interesting dynamic for us and one that we track and one that we're investing in. And what it means specifically for Juniper is three different things. One I've mentioned already, which is around security. Our high-end security portfolio provides our customers with that perfect cocktail, if you will of performance and efficacy. That is really unique in the industry today and has resulted in a number of worldwide service provider win where service providers are deploying the technology to protect users, infrastructure and data in anticipation of 5G deployments. Second is about transport. I mean, there's no doubt that if you're going to have Faster RAN, Faster Radio Access Network, that's going to result in more bits that needs to be carried in fiber optic networks and that's where we come to play. Today, it's largely around core and edge. And as I mentioned earlier, increasingly it's about metro with the portfolio that we're starting to introduce into the market. And the third element of 5G that's very important to us is the data center, because 5G is inherently going to be a cloud native deployment model, especially with O-RAN and D-RAN deployments that are picking up steam in the industry. Those require highly distributed, highly automated data centers. And that's something where we've already seen some strong momentum in with the combination of our hardware portfolio, but then also our software-defined networking portfolio and Contrail that stitches the solution nicely for our customers. Jess Lubert : Operator, we'll take two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you. I have two questions for you all. And I think one is the cloud growth that you have sketched out for us in 2021, sort of flattish to low-single digit. Couldn't that be better? I mean, shouldn't that be better in cloud that's where the action is. The pandemic is driving roads there, sounds like there's some share gains coming. And I just \u2013 I feel like that's kind of a low bar. I was hoping that that number might be a little higher. So if you could shed some light on that, that'd be grateful. And then secondly Ken, if you wouldn't mind clarifying on your sort of slight EPS growth above revenues, is that inclusive of 128 or is that on an organic basis? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, let me address the first question and then I'll let Ken address the second one. On the cloud, it is entirely dependent on the deployments of large hyperscale cloud providers. I mean, keep in mind that we have a unique position among cloud providers with the footprint that we have and we preserved. And if you recall, if you've been tracking us for long enough, a couple of years back, we went through a fairly difficult product transition that's now behind us. And the whole idea there was to retain that footprint so that we can benefit from deployments that are happening. And we saw some of that in the first half of this year, but cloud has always been a highly lumpy type of vertical because of the concentrated nature of the customer base and CapEx expenditures within that customer base. So I remain optimistic about cloud as a vertical that we focus on long-term, but we're doing everything we can and the rest is really up to our customers and their deployment patterns. Ken Miller : And on the EPS front, the commentary provided for 2021 where we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow slightly faster than revenue that does include 128 Technology, which we mentioned is about $0.05 diluted, that's our expectation that includes that dilution from 128 Technologies. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you all very much. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question on product gross margins and just kind of the down take year-over-year, I would think with stronger routing performance that maybe margins would be a little bit better. So is that, should we consider some of that weakness just from stronger deployments or just any commentary around gross margins kind of on a year-over-year product basis would be helpful. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. So there's really two drivers. One would be the COVID related costs that we talked about a lot on the last call. So clearly there are some year-on-year comp differences. Our margin would have been up a full point in the Juniper aggregate level, on the product side only it would have been closer to a 0.5 increase if it weren't for some of these COVID elevated costs. It's still is down year-on-year, even if you adjust for that on the product only side and that is a factor of mix. And it's to your point it's not as simple as just looking routing versus switching or service provider versus enterprise. You really have to get down a level into what's happening in a mix. One example I'll mention is software, right. So the software mix is clearly down year-on-year, we've talked about that and that's hurting margins a bit on a year-to-year basis. There's also just different product mix, different customer mix, different deal mix this all factors into our gross margin results. We're pleased with our performance this year. We expect to grow margin with volume going forward. We expect software mix to become a bigger contributor in next year, which will also help gross margin expand on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to focus on value engineering efforts. So we feel confident about where we are and where we're headed with gross margin. Meta Marshall : Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, you guys have alluded to this, but just in terms of some of the enterprise strength that you're seeing, would you characterize that as you've made the portfolio more \u2013 you've buffered the portfolio, you've made the sales investments or just kind of improved buying behavior on part of the customer, that seems as if it's the sales investments that you're kind of pointing to primarily at least in early days and product portfolio kind of in 2021, but just any last commentary there. Rami Rahim : Yes. I'd be happy to address that. Definitely, we've made some investments, both in go to market in sales in particular, but then also in the product portfolio. I talked a lot about the differentiation in the AI-driven enterprise around campus and branch, and the wide area, but I also just emphasize that our innovation is strong in the data center as well and we've seen some real great momentum in the data center across not just the enterprise, but also with telcos. They're all deploying lots of data centers in a distributed fashion to get ready for 5G deployments to offer different types of virtualized services. Both go to market and portfolio strength is the primary driver for our enterprise momentum. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation. Have a great rest of your evening.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Jess Lubert. Thank you, Jeff. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you operator, good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago, the biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year and we made progress stabilizing our service provider business with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees, who have executed exceptionally well and I would like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity. We are proud to be one of the key players of the global Internet and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. We are exiting 2020 following two consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go to market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions such as Mist that create new revenue stream and pull-through sales of our existing products. While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I\u2019d like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus where we plan to double down in the New Year, which you\u2019ll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we are entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction scores we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. Second, focusing our business on specific use cases, which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and it\u2019s positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I\u2019m very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions, which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we\u2019ve taken along with some of the investments we have made should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities such as 400 gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end market conditions remain challenged. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise, we delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad based across geographies and we secured a significant multi-year opportunity with an international global 10 account for our wireless, wired and SDRAM portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings and specifically the momentum we are seeing around Mist, which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our Wired Assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist Wireless LAN, Wired Assurance, Marvis, virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020 and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client to cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-routing action, but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience-first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the Leaders Quadrant for wired and wireless access where we were named the leader of leaders in terms of ability to execute. The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application end-user of our SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market, but also to extend the value of Mist secure AI engine and cloud management capability from client to cloud. Our service provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved service provider results we delivered both in Q4 and for the full year 2020 are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which would enable us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the service provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access aggregation and net for routing opportunities, which in aggregate represents a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn\u2019t played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging and we believe the combination of these products with Netrounds software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market. Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our service provider business during the upcoming year despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We\u2019ve been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy and we continue to see strong wide area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases that expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio and Apstra will further enhance our position, but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market efforts. Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. Importantly, we're continuing to make progress on 400 gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400 gig capable products, while many of our wins are addressing wide area use cases where we have historically been strong. We're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400 gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right products and customer engagement to both protect our wide area footprint and capture switching share as the 400 gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market, both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here, but also in the area of closed loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day zero, day one and day two automated operations. We think these abilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environments. Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. As a company, we remain laser focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription-based software. While high value staff and subscription software are smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly, which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our Mist Cloud, as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewal and tax rate as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, both above the mid-point of guidance. Revenue grew 1%, which was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The higher than mid-point results were driven by strength across all verticals. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service Provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. From a technology perspective, Routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our Services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Our Top 10 customers accounted for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our Software as a Service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher than anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the Go-to-Market organization as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology. Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter and increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I\u2019d like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million respectively, as of year-end. Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact from the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year. Looking at our technology, Routing declined 1%, Switching grew 2%, and Security declined 9% year-over-year. Our Services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue; the second year of Software being at or above this level. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the year, five were Cloud, four were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our Service gross margin. Throughout the year, we continued to focus on disciplined operating expense management with a modest increase of less than 1%, on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired two growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt, locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity, while preserving our investment grade credit profile. I\u2019m proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilient through this challenging and uncertain times. Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the mid-point of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisition. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter. Excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID-related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisitions as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. Before we move on to the Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the mid-point of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first-half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full-year basis. In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full-year gross margin of approximately 60% due to higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs, and higher software mix, as well as improved services costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full-year basis as we absorb our recent acquisitions and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. I would also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5% plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just get sort of a very simple one out of the way. I appreciate the commentary on the full year. One of the trends that we assume would occur would be expenses rising in the second half of the year with some normalization in catch up post the pandemic. I'm thinking about things like travel expenses coming back. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about those kinds of expenses coming back. Is that something you're assuming happens in 2022, rather than later this year? And then I've got a bigger picture question afterwards. Rami Rahim : Sure. Thank you, Simon. So for Q1, the primary driver of the sequential growth in OpEx, the Q1 guide at $510 million really is the acquisitions that we recently closed, and that's about $20 million of OpEx in our Q1 number. We expect for the rest of the year to roughly maintain those Q1 levels around $510 million plus or minus a bit. We do anticipate there being some costs coming back into the equation when people start to travel again, et cetera, perhaps in the second half. However, I do think the new normal is still yet to be determined, and at this point I'm not expecting all the costs to come back. I think we'll be able to be conservative and basically efficient with our travel et cetera, as we move forward. So although I do expect some COVID costs to come back, we don't have a large amount baked into our current full year forecast at this time. Simon Leopold : Thanks for that. And then in terms of the trend, it seems pretty clear that the enterprise market vertical will become your largest by the end of 2021. And doing business in that space is just very different than Juniper's roots, so clearly you've done something different to get here, but could you talk about how this has affected the thinking on the long-term multi-year strategy and the profile of maybe the company's culture go-to-market? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. I'm happy to address that Simon. So this would be \u2013 2020 would be our fourth consecutive year of growth in the enterprise vertical. So this is not a new thing for us. However, I do believe that there have been a number of strategic actions that we've taken over the last few years equipping sales and structuring sales in a way that goes after the enterprise effectively and efficiently. Our organic innovations, our inorganic acquisitions have set us up to accelerate this part of our business. So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share. I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but Mindshare growth in the industry and I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises. So a big component of our success comes from large Fortune 500 Global 1,000 accounts where these sales investment is as efficient as it can be for that Enterprise. So, for all these reasons, I honestly, I've never felt better about our opportunity in the enterprise space. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for that. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you all taking questions. First off, Ken, in terms of the supply constraints, how large an issue [indiscernible] advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Cisco given the forward volume into Broadcom and other suppliers, or is that just not an issue in terms of both revenue growth and pricing? And I've got a bigger picture follow-up question. Rami Rahim : Yes. So we clearly did experience some pretty significant supply constraints in the peak of kind of the COVID pandemic, if you will, kind of in the summer months. We think we've had material improvements since then. I would articulate that as we exited the year, we're pretty much back to normal. We might have some elevated lead times here and there, but that's more due to demand being beyond our expectation than true supply constraints. I'm very pleased with how the team has really adapted and improve the supply as we proceed. That said backlog is higher. We're exiting the year with about 20% more backlog than we entered. So we are maintaining healthy backlog as we move into this year in 2021 and really the supply constraints, extended lead times, et cetera, that we saw through most of the summer months are largely behind us at this point. I don't believe we're at a competitive disadvantage. Our team does a great job with components manufacturing and component suppliers to negotiate the supply that we need. Paul Silverstein : All right. And then on, I hate to ask you this, because I think I asked you all every quarter, so my apologies, but I think it's been an investor concern for a while, which is have you seen any share losses or are there any signs of awards away from you specifically in cloud for the GCI and WAN, routing or switching use cases? And on the other side of the equation, Rami your comments about ongoing optimism in the cloud, any incremental insight you can give in terms of where's the opportunity for the greatest upside? Rami Rahim : Certainly, Paul. So the short answer to your question is no. We have not lost share or footprint in cloud routing today, I mean, in cloud period, I should say. We saw our routing up double digit year-over-year in the Q4 timeframe. I think that is an indication of the health of the footprint that we have retained in this extremely important vertical for us. We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud both within the hyperscale cloud providers, where we enjoy footprints across practically all of them, but also among the \u2013 what we used to call Tier 2, Tier 3, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technology that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching, it's also about security in this very important vertical. As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right. We didn't anticipate any major additional share taking that's going to happen in 2021 to achieve the growth that we believe that we can achieve in 2021, but I do think that with the right focus in go-to-market, the technology that I know we have, that I know is very competitive, we can in fact take some additional share as well in this vertical. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, two, if I could as well. First, maybe Rami talk a little bit about the enterprise side. You mentioned a lot of really good cross-selling with Mist. It seems to be doing very well. Could you talk a little bit about kind of win rates, deal sizes and kind of how you get more at that out of that business to keep the ball rolling? And then second you talked \u2013 obviously there's a bunch of other acquisitions and you've framed for us the size of them. Can you talk a little bit about the three of them? And how easy it's going to be for the Salesforce to engage with those and potentially make one, two, or all of them have a similar type of impact and ramp that that Mist is having on the company? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, it's a great question, Tim. Thank you. So as just a couple of data points for you to give you an indication of just how well we're doing with Mist. Our annualized order business for Mist standalone in Q4 exceeded $200 million. And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework on a standalone annualized order basis, it's really around 300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. We're going to take the playbook that we implemented in getting our sellers very proficient and being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology, and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year. 128 and Apstra in particular, which are mostly suited for the enterprise, but have applicability in other verticals as well. With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fits beautifully under the Mist client to cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insights telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improve the automation and improve the end user experience for our customers. Apstra takes this experience first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus in client to cloud and apply this to the data center. So, honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday has been like exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. And then the last acquisition is a little bit on \u2013 a smaller one, which is Netrounds. And Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the service provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience, assured SLAs to service providers and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well. Ken Miller : Yes. And on the enterprise kind of customer acquisition question, Tim, I mean, we did mentioned in Rami's prepared remarks that we did see 125% increase in new logos for Mist. I would tell you that a good percentage of those logos, our existing Juniper install-based customers are really leveraging our install-base with the growth asset of Mist is pretty much part of the strategy to accelerate the Mist growth, but also a good percentage of those customers are net new to Juniper. So really there is a land and expand opportunity where we might lead with the Mist and the Mist AI engine, and then expand to the rest of the portfolio. So it really excited about the enterprise and then we're seeing from a customer acquisition perspective. Tim Long : Okay, great. Thank you guys. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Rami, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the stabilization in the service provider spending, but I think you mentioned that Telco, U.S. Telco's spending has been weak, whereas you are just kind of seeing stress within the cable customers. Can you just kind of talk about how long do you think this weakness from U.S. service provider \u2013 in relation to U.S. service provider spending kind of continue? And what kind of impact maybe some of these auctions going on in the U.S. are having on spending? And I have a follow up. Rami Rahim : Yes, I'd be happy to Samik. We're very pleased with our results in SPs. The Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint. Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoyed very strong, healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide are our customers trust Juniper technology. We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in a spectrum auctions and so forth. So it's diverted investment away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. If you look out into 2021 and we provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020, in 2021, we did not end that outlook anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SPs. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we developed and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more. The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on, so increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers. You'll notice that we had a very healthy quarter in Asia Pacific. I'm very proud of the team out in APAC for really showing results, not just in SP, but across all verticals. And that's just an indication of the kind of diversification we're driving through our business. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Got it. I had a follow up on the 400 gig wins that you talked about, I think you said you have 100 wins and most of them are in the WAN, but there's a portion of them in data center switching as well. If you can just kind of talk about how many of those switching wins are, where you already had that position in the data center with the customer versus kind of new wins where you met a displaced incumbents, or it's a new use case that's kind of come up and you've managed to gain a position there, which is kind of an incremental opportunity? Rami Rahim : Yes, in cloud provider data center switching, many wins are going to be mostly around net new share for us because that's where our existing share is not all that high. I don't know the exact split of the business that you're asking for, but I'll give you this data point. If you look at the foundation of 400 gig business today and measured in the number of customers, in the Q3 of 2020 timeframe our cumulative number of customers that invested in 400 gig capable switching technology and compared that to the Q4 timeframe, same metric cumulative number of customers that invested in 400 gig switching technology, that's doubled. So, whereas the revenue from 400 gig switching today is still relatively small in comparison to the total switching business, the way we measure it is momentum and wins and momentum and customers and you can see that that momentum is quite solid. That's a very encouraging data point for us. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Interesting. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had a couple of quick number clarification than a question on the products. So on the numbers, can you set 2% to 3% growth and then 1% for acquisitions? Is that 1% on top of the 2% to 3%? Or is it included\u2026 Ken Miller : Yes, that would be on top of, so \u2013 yes, that would be on top of. Rod Hall : Okay. Ken Miller : So we expect to navigate 3% to 4% in total. Rod Hall : Right. Okay, that's what I thought. And then on the gross margins, you said excluding COVID costs, I'm assuming COVID costs there would be just a few tenths of a percent. Could you just confirm that that's the case? Ken Miller : Our COVID costs are running between 50 and 100 basis points in any given quarter, so it's fairly material impact to our past few quarters and I expect it to be similar in Q1. I do think that should come down a bit in maybe the second half, but the first half I expect it to be remain in that 50 to 100 basis points of impact. Rod Hall : Okay. So we add 50 to 100 back to account for the COVID costs. Ken Miller : Yes, once the cost normalized, that's what we would expect to see. Yes. Rod Hall : Okay. And then on the products, I just wanted to check on Mist again, Rami, that I guess that the thing that we get back from investors quite a bit is this \u2013 it's hard for people to believe that that campus networking oriented products like that are going to continue to do well as we reopened, I think a lot of people think, gosh, why would people invest in their campus networking. And I know there's reasons for that, namely that you don't have a lot of market share there and there's a lot to go for. But could you just kind of help maybe for the broader audience, help us all understand kind of what's going through customers' minds when they think about investing in that and in the kind of a reopening environment and an environment where maybe more people are working from home long-term that sort of thing? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly. It's actually a great question, Rod. So in \u2013 the way that we've maintained our momentum throughout the pandemic is on focusing on sub-segments of the enterprise and of course cloud and SP, but primarily in the enterprise that are most resilient to economic perturbations or spending patterns in IT, so financial services, higher education so think here college campuses, U.S. federal government, large big box type retailers, warehouses. These are all areas where investments in IT and networking must be made today. But as we look out beyond the pandemic and you start to think about what happens when we recover from the pandemic, my strong belief is that there will be a pivot towards investments in IT technology that's going to be cloud delivered, AI driven. It's not going to be the complex legacy on-prem traditional technologies that quite frankly are not important to Juniper and not a part of our strategy, it's the cloud delivered technology that I think we'll actually see an acceleration as you get out of this COVID crisis. So my view is that we've done what's necessary to capture share during the pandemic and we're setting ourselves up with a strategy that's going to be geared to where investments are going to be greatest post-pandemic. Rod Hall : So you would be thinking that people are investing to give themselves more resiliency, more workforce flexibility that kind of thing as they think through the other side of the pandemic. Rami Rahim : Absolutely, whether it is because they need that flexibility or because they want to crush the costs of running networks by replacing the human elements of running network with automation and that is the magic of Mist. And again, don't think of Mist as just wireless LAN. Mist is that cloud delivered AI powered automation framework for wireless, wired, and now with 128 Technology WAN that full client to cloud experience. Rod Hall : Okay. That's great. Thank you, Rami. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you. I guess my first question is about cloud. And I guess I'm wondering are there opportunities for you to do better than that growth statement that you gave for the year? And I say that in the context of \u2013 we had a couple of tough years in cloud as you, I'm sure, know better than I do. And we've had now a couple of decent years in clouds within the flattish or up some. But at the same time we see these cloud companies that are growing their revenues and expanding their CapEx and building new data centers at a faster clip than what your revenues are doing. And so I'm wondering if there's an opportunity here whether it's 2021 or 2022 or down the road to kind of close the gap a little bit and make cloud more sustainable mid or even high single digit grower. Rami Rahim : Yes. Yes. So, Jeff, it's a good question. So we've seen now two years of growth in cloud. When we provide our outlook for 2021, we're not assuming any major take share type opportunities that we score that would accelerate beyond just the statement of growth. I mean, that's really the thing that I would ask you to take note of. If there were 400 gig opportunities that would represent major like net new footprint and certainly that would be additive and I will say this, I mean, we do see those opportunities and we're \u2013 absolutely sleeves are rolled up and we're aggressively fighting for them and actually I feel kind of good about them, but we're not yet at a point where we want to call them in our outlook for 2021. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. All right. And then secondly just to follow up on Rod's question a bit. How do you feel like your enterprise customers are now perceiving their willingness to invest? And I think we cycle back a quarter or two, these are different companies we talk about, well they are doing digital transformation on the [indiscernible] feels like people are back. Where are we in the recovery spending zone? Are we fully back yet? Or is there more \u2013 is there opportunity for acceleration from here? Rami Rahim : No, I don't think we're fully back yet. I still believe that there are COVID related headwinds that we were facing and we're anticipating that we will continue to face. In fact, I strongly believe that our enterprise business would have performed even better in 2020, had it not been for COVID. We're not in our outlook for enterprise accounting on in a major recovery, a significant recovery from COVID type spending in enterprise, but should that \u2013 should that reverse, let's say, in the second half of the year enterprises go back to spending more like they used to then I think will absolutely benefit from that. As far as your question around appetite for spending in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rod financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers, actually the appetite for investments as measured by large projects are \u2013 is there we've seen it and we've won many opportunities based on the merits, the differentiation of our technology. The last thing I would say is even in this, let's say, the smaller type enterprises, let's say mid-sized enterprises, where COVID is going to be more of a headwind, more of a factor to be considered in IT teams justifying projects. I would argue that we're living in a time now where differentiation matters most, right. And I've never felt more strong about the merits of our technology, the differentiation of our solution for the enterprise. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you, Rami. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. The first question is more of a timing and clarification on one of your cloud comments. Rami, you mentioned that you are completing some projects and then you are seeing the commencement of other projects. I just want to get an idea on some of the seasonality or just the timing of some of these? Are we seeing things kind of wind down right now, which means that things could be kind of slow for quarter or two in the cloud segment? And then could they potentially ramp back up very quickly instead of back half of 2021? Is there anything you should be expecting and kind of the lumpiness in 2021 cloud revenue? Rami Rahim : Yes. I'm happy to answer that Sami. So first, I wouldn't say seasonality because it sort of indicates maybe some timing of orders that's based on which quarter of the year, and that's not necessarily what we're seeing. What we see within the cloud vertical are really two dynamics. One of them is a natural evolution of the deployment of used cases. So they're always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They kind of reduced over time, but we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer. So any cloud provider, especially how hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases and that natural evolution of use cases it's always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. The second factor within the cloud vertical is just diversity within or among customers. We're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers and that offset some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers. And we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers, so that naturally is going to be more diverse element of our business. Sami Badri : Got it. But just to kind of lock on here; the first half of 2021 should be relatively like no real surprises, or should we be kind of expecting lumpiness or anything like that, just so I can frame out the year a little bit? Rami Rahim : No. We're not anticipating any surprises. I mean, like I said, when we provide an outlook of growth in clouds where we're totally factoring in this transition of used cases in our business and we're also of course taking into account that we've got a diversity of customers and we're not counting on any major net new footprint wins. Sami Badri : Got it. Got it. I wanted to thank you for that. I just want to shift gears a little bit back to something that was a big dynamic about two years ago, the MX, the PTX transition. This hasn't really come up much recently? Rami Rahim : Operator, we are \u2013 we have to move on to our next question. Sami Badri : Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vaughn with UBS. Please proceed with your question. David Vaughn : Great. Thanks guys. Just want to circle back on the enterprise for a second. Clearly it's becoming a critical driver of the company going forward. And the recent M&A clearly has been really focused on that segment. Just wanted to touch on how do you think about the portfolio today going forward and where or if there are any wide spaces that you need to address going forward to really solidify our bad market going forward? And then I just have a quick follow up question. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I really do think that we've rounded out our portfolio and our position, our solutions, each of our three really important used cases. I don't think there are any glaring gaps at this point in time. We're always going to be looking for opportunities for value enhancing M&A, but quite frankly where my mind is at right now, where my focus is at is on landing and integrating successfully and achieving the kind of business momentum and success that we saw with Mist to these acquisitions that we made last year. David Vaughn : Great. And just a quick follow-up on all the M&A activity. I think last quarter you mentioned, post the closing of 128, you would expect that a point of growth this year in 2021 from that transaction and your commentary is certainly sounds like the receptiveness or the enthusiasm around Apstra has gotten clearly ahead of your expectations? Does that suggest that sort of the expectation from an M&A perspective that you have today probably is a little bit conservative given sort of the initial client feedback from the transaction that you've completed? Ken Miller : Yes. We did. We did tweak the language a little bit there. David, we talked about being nearly a point of growth. We thought that the 128 Tech and Netrounds would give us nearly a point of growth. We're now updating [indiscernible]. We do expect a full point of growth from our recent acquisition. So it's a modest change in our outlook there. David Vaughn : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Ken. Ken Miller : Sure. Rami Rahim : Operator we'll take two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers, your line is live. You may proceed with your question. Rami Rahim : Maybe we can go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the spending patterns that you\u2019re seeing from enterprise customers. Not so much driven by COVID but rather by the impact of SolarWinds hack. We\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time talking to value-added resellers during the survey work and the like as well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intentions around security have ratcheted up quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending potentially improving once COVID is resolved. Have you had conversations with the C-suite types in the large accounts or even intermediate sized accounts that are recent enough to get a handle on whether SolarWinds had an impact on spending intentions and while you\u2019re at it did you have any impact on as a result of the hack? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So there are a few things there to unpack. First I want to say actually what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend, more tailwind and acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we at the Company are focused on. Next I want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of SolarWinds, we never put that SolarWinds product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And, of course, once we \u2013 once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures and we didn\u2019t find that we were in any way exposed. So that I\u2019d just get out of the way. In terms of has SolarWinds or other security type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders our CISOs to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely yes. I mean, there is a reason that I think it\u2019s very important that as a networking company you also have security competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business. That\u2019s never been more important. So our security business in Q4 did not grow but there is a reason for this. The high end of our security where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolios, really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client to cloud Mist solution is that it\u2019s going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our - the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I\u2019m actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business. Alex Henderson : So did you talk to any CIC sweets post the hack broke in December? [Indiscernible] to me that, we wish we could have a hack like this every year. If they're going to have a hack, have it in December because it's spiked spending intentions. Have you heard anything along those lines from anybody in the C-suites that you've talked to? Rami Rahim : Yes. So my remarks were \u2013 Alex, were absolutely based on conversations that I have on an ongoing basis with C-suite professionals. So a big and very important part of my job is to talk on a regular basis to CEO, CIO, CTO of large enterprises, service providers, cloud providers and the net of it is absolutely security is a top of mind consideration. It's driving spending, and making sure that our customers understand that security is embedded in all of our strategic use case solutions is a big part of my job. Alex Henderson : Okay. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Ryan Koontz : I think the question, great progress on the routing side with service provider stabilizing there. I would, if you could give us any color on some of the used cases you're seeing, some of the new used cases in the enterprise and cloud. Is it as simple as the campus and DCI WAN piece or am I missing some other interesting used cases? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. I'm very pleased with our routing progress. In Q4 we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises, governments and cable momentum was strong MX and PTX grew both year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad-based. The used cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity isn't on our metro roadmap. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip, is probably the fastest growing routing sub-market of the overall routing market. And it's largely untapped by Juniper. And the good news is this is just another high performance network, but it requires certain capabilities, certain aspects of your products around footprint and efficiency \u2013 power efficiency, and certain types of features. These are all within our wheelhouse, and this is a roadmap that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduced this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Net rounds really fits beautifully into the solution because it provides that automation and SLA assurance, and that's important for the metro. So that I believe is going to help us in our routing business in 2021, but especially in 2022, when the, when the portfolio is complete. Ryan Koontz : Helpful, Rami. Thanks very much. Rami Rahim : My pleasure, Ryan. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jess Lubert for any closing comments. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Before we conclude today's call, I'd like to remind everyone that Juniper will be hosting its virtual 2021 Investor Day on February 12th. Executive presentations will start at 10 :00 AM Eastern Standard Time and can be accessed via a link which we posted to our IR website. If you have any questions regarding how to participate in the event, you can reach out to me at jlubert@juniper.net. We look forward to hopefully seeing you there. That concludes today's call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful evening.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to your host Mr. Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss our Q1 2021 results. We delivered strong results during the March quarter. Revenue exceeded our expectation, and we experienced year-over-year growth across all verticals and geographies. Product orders experienced mid-teens growth year-over-year, and we grew backlog on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Momentum was especially strong in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals with Cloud orders growing nearly 30% year-over-year, and Enterprise orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. While our Service Provider orders slightly declined year-over-year, even here the results exceeded our expectations. Near-term visibility is strong, and given the momentum we\u2019re seeing, we now expect to grow our business 4% to 5% in 2021 on a full year basis. The success we\u2019re seeing is due in large part to deliberate actions we have taken to both strengthen our portfolio and enhance our go-to-market organization. Our focus on leading the industry is delivering simplified operations and a superior end user experience, what we call Experience-First Networking is resonating in the market. And our deliberate focus on specific customer solutions is enabling us to accelerate our success across the areas we serve. We\u2019re seeing good early interest in Apstra, 128 Technology and Netrounds, which are not only strengthening our position in several attractive end markets, but also enhancing the success of the broader Juniper portfolio. Our go-to-market organization is executing well and the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years are paying off in the form of improved productivity and customer diversity. We\u2019re continuing to invest in both product differentiation and our go-to-market organization. I remain confident these actions will not only position us to benefit from a any potential improvements in end market conditions, but also to capture share as several large industry transitions unfold. There are several opportunities that are beginning to play out, where we feel strong about our position. First, the enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud operations, where our Mist AI offering, which was enhanced by the acquisition of 128 Technology, helps customer streamline operations, reduce costs and optimize end user experiences. This client-to-cloud differentiation is truly resonating. We believe the enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud architecture is likely to present a significant disruptive force in the campus and branch networking market, where we maintain significant sustainable advantages over all competitive platforms. Second is the Cloud and Service Provider transition to 400-gig systems, where we\u2019re continuing to see success, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. Our 400-gig solutions are highly competitive, and we remain optimistic in our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture net new opportunities in hyperscale, cloud major and Service Provider accounts. Last but not least, the Service Provider 5G and metro markets, which we view as a large opportunity, that is likely to see healthy growth over the next several years. We are playing to win in the Service Provider vertical and believe our investments in automation technologies, such as Netrounds and the introduction of new metro-oriented solution such as the award winning ACX7100 family should position us to gain share in this attractive portion of the market, where historically we\u2019ve had limited presence. I firmly believe we\u2019re taking share and that the investments we\u2019re making will position us not only capitalize on the big market opportunities that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered, and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years. Now I\u2019d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we\u2019re seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, which saw strong double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, and exceeded our own expectations in Q1. We experienced strength with both our Service Provider and Cloud customers, each of which delivered double-digit sales growth year-over-year. We grew in all geographies year-over-year, and momentum is healthy entering the June period. In the Service Provider vertical, our diversification strategy is continuing to yield positive results, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our cloud network offering, which combined our new ACX product with our Paragon Automation portfolio. We believe these solutions are highly competitive and well-positioned to win in one of the fastest growing portion of the Service Provider routing market. As I mentioned previously, we are playing to win in the Service Provider market, and I remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our automated WAN solutions in this important vertical. I\u2019d also like to highlight that our automated WAN portfolio had particularly strong orders from our cloud customers in Q1. While our strength was across multiple hyperscale accounts, we also saw improved activity with our largest cloud customer following several quarters of softer demand. Our cloud pipeline remains strong, but we are optimistic regarding the outlook for our wide area solutions, particularly in areas where we maintain incumbency, and are well-positioned to benefit from forming a big tailwind, that are likely to start ramping later this year. And for the year, we are confident in our outlook for our automated WAN solution, we expect 2021 results to be slightly above the high-end of the long-term forecast range we provided at our February Investor Day, calling for a 1% decline to 3% growth. While our cloud-ready data center solutions declined 10% year-over-year during Q1, orders grew nearly 30% year-over-year due to broad based strength across our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. Win rate improved and we saw a material increase in average deal size in the quarter. Apstra exceeded our expectation, and is already enabling us to win data center opportunity we likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to secure if we hadn\u2019t completed the deal in January. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for this business. While the Q1 revenue decline in our cloud-ready data center business was almost entirely due to expected weakness at a single large customer, orders with this customer also materially improved in the quarter and should positively impact results in future periods. For the year, we believe our cloud-ready data center business remains on track to achieve the long-term forecast range we highlighted at our Investor Day, looking for 5% to 9% growth, despite the slow revenue start to the year. Finally, our AI-driven enterprise solution experienced double-digit growth year-over-year, and exceeded expectations in the March quarter. Our Mist AI differentiation continued to resonate in the market as new logos nearly doubled in Q1 and Mist orders experienced another quarter of triple-digit growth with a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our Mist client business of wireless LAN, wired access,, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through approximately doubled year-over-year, and we saw record EX pull through in Q1. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we\u2019re also experiencing continued strength in the channel and improved momentum with smaller commercial accounts, which highlights the value of our AI-driven enterprise offering to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market leading differentiation, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. To enhance this leadership, we continue to bring new innovations to market that should further accelerate our success in future periods. Some of the innovation we\u2019ve recently announced include the industry-first campus switch that\u2019s optimized for AI-driven cloud operation, the EX4400, which provides customers with ease of set up, best-in-class fabric management, security, scale and AI-driven troubleshooting to find needle-in-haystack problem like misconfigured VLANs and bad cables. Add to that, the Mist-ification of our SRX branch gateway, which allows automated on-boarding and configuration using Mist AI and the cloud coupled with simple SD branch router and security configuration via the same platform as wired and wireless access. And the integration of 128 Technology\u2019s Session Smart routing with Mist WAN Assurance and Virtual Network Assistant capability to deliver the industry\u2019s first AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which includes customizable service level and proactive problem resolution on top of the already unique Session Smart capabilities of Juniper\u2019s SD-WAN solutions. While it remains early, we\u2019re seeing strong customer interest in 128 Technology\u2019s Session Smart routing capabilities in the field. We closed multi-million dollar deals with managed service providers in Europe and LATAM, had a significant expansion with a large global enterprise and won opportunities in the U.S. federal vertical. We are excited about our Mist-ification of 128 Technology and are focusing our attention on sales enablement and leveraging the Juniper go-to-market organization to accelerate 128 Technology\u2019s success. I remain encouraged by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our Security revenue experienced strong results during the March quarter and orders exceeded expectations in the period. Strength was especially notable in the high-end of the market, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and product families. We believe our Connected Security strategy is resonating in the market and that the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market, where we are currently focused. We\u2019re also benefiting from recent third-party validation, highlighting the superior efficacy of our products from reputable firms such as Gartner\u2019s ICSA and cyber ratings. We believe these dynamics will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software and related services revenue grew 7% in the March quarter. A strong growth in our ratable subscription offering such as Mist and healthy uptake of our Flex on-box software offerings were partially offset by lower sales of certain older products that carry a high level of perpetual software. ARR grew 28% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of Mist subscription, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offering. Software orders were particularly strong in the quarter, rising more than 70% on a year-over-year basis due to broad-based strength across verticals and used cases. We\u2019re seeing ongoing strength in the ratable subscription offering and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals we serve. Based on the momentum we\u2019re seeing, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our overall software business as well as the long-term ARR target we presented at our recent Investor Day. I would like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continue to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper, and I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2021 at $1,074 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, both above the mid-point of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 17%, Cloud grew 3% and Enterprise grew 1%. As expected, all verticals declined on a sequential basis. Orders were strong in the first quarter, with growth in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, with particular strength in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals. As we discussed at our Investor Day in February, this is the first quarter of our updated revenue reporting, pivoting from technology categories to customer solutions. The customer solution categories are automated WAN solutions, cloud-ready data center and AI-driven enterprise. As we have discussed, this change better aligns our revenue reporting to key growth drivers that is aligned with our strategy. Looking at revenue by customer solution, automated WAN solutions increased 22% year-over-year, with both MX and PTX product families posting year-over-year growth. Cloud-ready data center revenue decreased 10% year-over-year, while the timing of shipments impacted revenue results, order saw strong growth in the quarter. And finally, the AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 12% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product family both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $143 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue or ARR grew 28% year-over-year. Total security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions, was $163 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, four were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in Q1 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%, which was above the mid-point of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue. If it weren\u2019t for the pandemic-related elevated logistics and other supply chain related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.1% for the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repurchase of our remaining debt that was refinanced last quarter and the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Apstra. Cash flow from operations was $180 million. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividend, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, and repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Turning to our guidance. As I\u2019m sure you are aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory levels over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate disruptions outside of our control. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times will likely persist for the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductors supply to meet our full year financial forecast. Looking specifically at the second quarter, at the mid-point of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5% year-over-year. We expect to see sequential growth across our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, while Service Provider is expected to remain approximately flat. We expect our second quarter non-GAAP gross margins to benefit from higher volume and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. We expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the investments we are making to take advantage of future market opportunities. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for the upside we expect to experience in the first half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 100 basis points higher than our previous expectation of 3% to 4%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Enterprise revenue is expected to grow the fastest, Cloud is expected to grow toward the high-end of our long-term model range, and Service Provider is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year. At this time, our revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged for the second half of the year relative to the forecast we provided during our Q4 2020 earnings call. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, consistent with what we\u2019ve said on our Q4 2020 earnings call, as well as at our February 2021 Investor Day. We expect full-year non-GAAP gross margin to benefit from higher volume, improved service margin and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. We expect non-GAAP OI&E to remain near Q2 2021 levels through the course of the year. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. I guess, I wanted to dig into this order volume in a couple of ways. One, maybe, Ken, you could talk about book-to-bill or could you give us a book-to-bill number? And then secondly, more qualitatively, the software orders that are so strong, could you guys dive into a little bit of color on that, what particular things are driving that? Is it Mist or just give us some prioritization of where those software orders are coming from? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Rod. Let me start with the software, and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Ken. So obviously, very pleased with the momentum in our software business, 70% year-over-year growth in orders, particularly pleased with our momentum at 28% year-over-year. So the way we\u2019re running the business right now is we have an intense focus on our customer solutions, AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data center, and automated WAN. Each of these solutions has an embedded and a meaningful software component that we have invested in that drive significant differentiation in the market, and that ultimately delivers on our strategy of Experience-First Networking. So you can\u2019t sell an AI-driven enterprise solution without actually also selling a meaningful software component along with it. That is what is driving the momentum especially in off-box software offerings like Mist. And then I know it\u2019s early, but increasingly in solutions like Apstra as well. In addition to that is the Flex licensing model. This is a really simple on-box licensing model that gives customers the flexibility to choose what particular features and scale they want along with the traditional systems that they deploy in their network. So that combination is working very well for us. I feel very good about our ability to achieve our long-term targets that we provided to you in the recent analyst event, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to see good solid momentum in the software space. Ken Miller : And I\u2019ll just on the software side, we did see very strong bookings growth of 70%-plus. You see revenue was at 7%. The delta there, if it\u2019s not obvious is really mostly in our backlog where we did book some software orders that we haven\u2019t yet shipped or fulfilled, and also there is a growing piece of deferred software revenue, which is actually shows up predominantly in our service deferred revenue. So we are seeing some of the bookings, even when we fulfill it, it doesn\u2019t show up in revenue right away as it gets recognized over time and that\u2019s really our ARR business, which is also a very strong grower for us this quarter. From a book-to-bill perspective, we don\u2019t disclose the number, Rod, but I can tell you, it\u2019s clearly over one. I mean we grew backlog both year-over-year and sequentially. We don\u2019t typically grow backlog sequentially in Q1. This is something that due to the kind of unexpected order strength that we saw, the mid-teens orders growth really resulted in a backlog growth quarter for us, and a book-to-bill greater than one. Rod Hall : Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Rami Rahim : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question as well. I guess, I have one question and a follow-up. On the Enterprise side, maybe to start with, it appears that your solutions especially wrap with Mist is resonating well with customers, but as I think about the positivity that you have around Enterprise, is only to think about how much of that is really driven by a cyclical up-shift given budget is getting better on the Enterprise side versus perhaps share gain that Juniper seeing versus their incumbents? Rami Rahim : Yes, Amit, I have no doubt in the Enterprise, we\u2019re taking share and it\u2019s on the back of some really meaningful and differentiated solutions and technologies that we\u2019ve introduced into the market. And in the Enterprise space there might be some COVID related tailwinds in some areas of the Enterprise, but there are a lot of headwinds in certain segments of the Enterprise, and I think the team has done a phenomenal job of pivoting rapidly to focus in areas where the Enterprise spending is going to be more COVID resilient, and then add to that the differentiation that we\u2019ve built, both organically and inorganically. In AI-driven enterprise, we powered by Mist, double-digit growth, pretty much every customer vertical, new logos are growing very rapidly at 2x year-over-year, a record number of million dollar deals. Like I said, I\u2019m very confident that this is share taking growth. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the supply chain side, I think you implied that 70 basis point margin headwind from logistics supply chain issues in the quarter. How do you see that number stack up as you go through the year? And then did you have any revenue that you put on the table into the supply chain issues as well? Rami Rahim : Before I let Ken answer that specific question, I just want to say, this is a worldwide shortage that\u2019s affecting practically every tech company across all industries. So what Juniper is experiencing, I don\u2019t think is unique. Having said that, I have a lot of confidence in the strength of our supply chain team. I think they are navigating the current situation phenomenally well. And as Ken mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve invested in our supply chain, really starting over a year ago, that\u2019s helping us right now. So there is no doubt there are going to be some challenges that we need to work around, but I have a lot of confidence in the strength of the team and the relationships that we have with our suppliers in pulling through this. And Ken, maybe provide some additional color. Ken Miller : Yes. And as we mentioned, the impact in Q1 was about 70 basis points, and that is predominantly logistics in kind of some of the COVID related costs that we\u2019ve be talking about the last couple of quarters and the freight cost for paying per kilogram are still significantly elevated versus pre-COVID levels. We expect that to be maintained over the next couple of quarters. It is difficult to predict when that\u2019s going to normalize, but I do expect that to normalize eventually, but I do think it\u2019s going to take a few more quarters for that to normalize. In addition to that, we are starting to factor in some potential costs to creep from a component perspective due to the supply constraints that we\u2019ve mentioned before. So we have factored in some costs, component cost to increase into our current forecast. We still believe 60% is the right target for us on a full-year basis for this year, despite some of these incremental costs, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching very closely and we\u2019ll obviously be managing it aggressively as we have been, and we\u2019ll continue to keep you guys updated as we go. There is a fair amount of uncertainty there, but based on our current expectations, we feel that the 60% target that we have for the year still holds true. From a revenue loss perspective, we are seeing extended lead times, so that means an order that we would book might not recognize in the same period as it would have otherwise. However, we feel that the revenue results we just posted in Q1, the guidance we just put out there for Q2 are quite strong based on the demand strength that we\u2019re seeing and we feel good about our ability to procure the supply we need to hit our revenue forecast. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thank you. I appreciate that. First, I wanted to see if maybe you could unpack your cloud vertical a little bit. And where I\u2019m going with this question is we\u2019ve gotten the impression that you tend to be disproportionately stronger and what\u2019s often called Tier 2, Tier 3 as opposed to hyperscale. Is there some insight you can offer to help us understand the dynamics of maybe breaking up that cloud vertical? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, Simon. Thanks for the question. Our position in the cloud vertical including hyperscale is actually quite unique. The share that we have with hyperscale routing, in particular, is second to none in the industry, I believe. So the strength that we saw in Q1 was actually very broad-based, certainly, hyperscale contributed to that momentum. And the nice thing about the hyperscale momentum that we\u2019re seeing right now is that it\u2019s not just about one or even two accounts, that it\u2019s fairly well distributed, there is good amount of diversification within hyperscale. After that, the cloud majors which are the smaller cloud providers, international cloud providers, they have also contributed to that momentum. So in Q1 we saw double-digit growth in routing, again, based on the footprint that we enjoy. Switching was down, but only because of a particular use case in one customer that essentially a wide area use case. I\u2019ve actually talked about that in the last one or two earnings calls, but I will note here that even in that use case we\u2019ve now started to see a resumption of spend by our large customer that deploys it in this manner. And then orders up 30%, nearly 30% year-over-year, again is indicative of the position that we have. I mean I think the way you should look at cloud providers today is, there is certainly competition that\u2019s happening for future build-out especially 400-gig, I feel very good about the competitive nature of our solutions, the engagement with our cloud provider customers. But I think will bode well for us in the future especially as you get into the second half of this year and next year. But then to benefit from the investments, the hyperscale and the broader cloud major customers have today, you need to have the footprint, and we have the footprint. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Ken Miller : And just to\u2026 Simon Leopold : Sorry. Go ahead, Ken. Ken Miller : Sorry, Simon. I just wanted to clarify in aggregate, so if you look at our cloud vertical in aggregate, our hyperscale number is the larger piece, it\u2019s bigger than our Tier 2, Tier 3, our cloud majors piece. But it is predominantly as Rami mentioned, it\u2019s the wide area networking use cases are routing footprint that we\u2019ve enjoyed there for so many years, where we\u2019re seeing growth on the cloud majors of the Tier 2, Tier 3 side is really in the data center side. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing more mix toward switching in the cloud-ready data center solutions to the Tier 2, Tier 3 and we\u2019re obviously kind of break into the hyperscale and data center side. But right now, our footprint is predominantly on the automated WAN solutions. Simon Leopold : Great. Appreciate that. Just as my follow-up. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about your intentions in terms of market share on the enterprise campus both switching and wireless LAN. What\u2019s a realistic expectation for how many points of market share? Do you think you could take in a year? And what\u2019s your objective. Do you \u2013 is your sort of goal to get to a 10% level in some time, help us understand the milestones we should look forward? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Well, I think we\u2019re focusing on areas of the campus and branch market that are fastest-growing that I think we\u2019ll see the quickest recovery post-COVID. And even now, where there are some meaningful headwinds in certain segments of the enterprise, because of COVID, we\u2019re doing really well. And I think, again this is on as a result of the significant differentiation that we have in the market. And I would also just add that, that differentiation is very difficult to replicate. I mean, we now have a five years of AI-driven solution building and learning that happened in the market, that\u2019s given our capabilities really some solid differentiation. And this is going to be the fastest growing vertical for Juniper, enterprise all up and campus is a very significant component of the enterprise. And as a result of that, we have been taking share over the last several years and I think we\u2019re going to continue to take meaningful share going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Joe Cardoso : Hi, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. My first question is just on the Service Provider vertical, it\u2019s sounding much better than when you guys last spoke on it. So first of all, is that a fair comment, and if so can you help us understand what is driving the improved outlook and visibility there? Rami Rahim : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. So obviously delighted with the Service Provider momentum in Q1, strong revenue performance, now partially explained by a need to compare relative to last year, but I would say that it did exceed our expectations, including from an order standpoint. And what I really like about our performance in the Service Provider space is the diversity, both from the standpoint of geography, that is not a North America phenomenon or a European phenomenon. It\u2019s broad-based across every geography, the diversity of solutions and technologies, so we\u2019re seeing strength in routing as you would expect, but we\u2019re also seeing strength in security as Service Provider gear up for 5G deployments; platforms, MX has always been a workhorse in the Service Provider space and we continue to invest in new line cards, new software capabilities, but we\u2019re starting to see some good PTX momentum and solid 400-gig wins in competitive bids with the Service Provider. And last but not least, I will add that. Tier 1 spending \u2013 Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider spending has actually been weak over the last year or so as we\u2019ve outlined in previous earnings call or calls. But we\u2019ve actually seen a bit more, let\u2019s say, signs of life or resumption in spending by some Tier 1 operators as well which is encouraging. Add to that the differentiation, we\u2019ve introduced the system in the Q1 time frame, our Paragon Automation suite and this really addresses a real need in the market for the types of tools that customers are looking for, for planning and provisioning and insights and assurance. And then, we also launched our cloud metro strategy, which is really our big push into the metro space, and announced two new ACX metro platforms and that we shipped, one of them already ACX7100, which is a 5G ready, high density, high capacity solution to address the future of 5G metro build-outs, and that\u2019s a net new opportunity for Juniper, that we traditionally not had any meaningful presence here, but we expect that to contribute to our revenue performance over the next few years. So it\u2019s for that reason that we\u2019re now tracking up to the high end of our long-term model for this full year 2021. Ken Miller : Yes, Joe. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we did bring the full year outlook up from a revenue perspective, it was 3% to 4% earlier in the year now, we\u2019re up of 4% to 5% on a full year basis. The vertical that actually came up the most was our Service Provider vertical. We were talking before about it being further stabilization. If you recall 2020, we were down 4% a full year basis and we thought we would get closer to zero this year from negative four to something closer to zero that\u2019s the further stabilization. We\u2019re now calling a SP based on the strength of the first half to be flat to slightly up on a full year basis, which as Rami mentioned is more in line with our long-term model, actually the high end of our long-term model, whereas previously we were kind of tracking toward the low end. So we are seeing some strength in SP, particularly here in the first half. Joe Cardoso : Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color on that. And then my second question is just on the acquisitions. You spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks, highlighting the different acquisitions you recently completed in contributing the better outlook in part due to them. I guess, just kind of diving in there, is there a particular acquisition that you guys would highlight driving the better outlook or has it been more broad-based? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, well. So we recently crossed the two-year anniversary since the close of Mist and that continues to do phenomenally well for us, and Mist is no longer a WiFi solution, Mist is an architectural approach that cloud-delivered AI-powered solution to everything from client to cloud and what we\u2019re seeing is the business all up under the Mist umbrella, doing incredibly well, right. Like I said, doubling new logos, record number of million dollar deals, et cetera. The other acquisitions are still a little bit newer, so it\u2019s still earlier. But I\u2019m very encouraged, based on what I\u2019m seeing thus far. Apstra, as an example has seen early interest from many customers. The pipeline is very solid. And it\u2019s clear that there are many customers out there that are looking for the ability to deploy private cloud, but are fearful of the operational complexity of private cloud, and Apstra provides the best solution that\u2019s truly multi-vendor. So it\u2019s not just working on top of Juniper underlay, but any vendors underlay solution to provide that seamless, easy, intent-based private cloud experience. There is a need in the market, and I firmly believe we have the best technology for it right now. 128 Technology, again there the Mist-ification of that technology, under the Mist umbrella is happening very rapidly. So we\u2019re introducing more and more capabilities. The second half of the year is going to be really important for ramping up that solution, but even on a stand-alone basis, we\u2019re closing multi-million dollar deals with managed service providers. We\u2019re seeing expansions of existing franchises that we have with 128 Technology. Federal government is especially interested in the security aspects of 128 Technology. So even though it\u2019s early, I\u2019m actually quite optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing thus far. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question. Jake Wilhelm : Hi, this is Jake Wilhelm on for Aaron. First of all, congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your visibility into your customers inventory levels? And maybe how that has changed? Ken Miller : I\u2019m sorry, you broke up a little bit there, Jake, could you repeat that the question on that\u2026 Jake Wilhelm : Sorry about that. I was wondering if you could talk about visibility into your cloud customers inventory levels and how that has changed? Rami Rahim : Got it. So yes, I mean with our cloud customers, first the momentum \u2013 since the beginning of the year has been phenomenal. It\u2019s always difficult to predict cloud demand on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, I would say that if you take a look at how their businesses are doing. I haven\u2019t seen the latest headlines today, but I suspect they are doing quite well. And I suspect, they\u2019re going to continue to do quite well and they cannot fuel that business without ongoing investments in their networks. So if the sort of the thrust of the question here is, is there demand that\u2019s happening within the cloud provider space that\u2019s trying to get ahead of some of the supply constraints in the industry? I believe, that yes, there is probably some of that that\u2019s happening right now, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s happening. I think we\u2019ve executed well. We preserved our footprint within the cloud vertical. We\u2019ve engaged as partners to our cloud customers. It\u2019s been broad-based across hyperscale and the cloud majors and it\u2019s for that reason that we now expect the full year in the cloud to be more on the high end of our long-term model. Ken Miller : Yes. And just as a reminder, we saw bookings growth in the cloud vertical nearly 30%, revenue was at a 3% clip. So clearly we\u2019re building some backlog in the \u2013 with the cloud vertical as well. We expect revenue to be up sequentially from a cloud perspective. Jake Wilhelm : Great, thanks. And then maybe kind of as a follow-up, I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but could you talk about any inflationary pressures you\u2019re seeing and component pricing? Ken Miller : Yes. So at this point, it is really difficult to predict. We\u2019re obviously working with our suppliers. We have long-term contracts in many cases, long-term pricing contracts, et cetera. So we\u2019re not expecting it to be, I would say super material. However, we are expecting there to be some impact and we are factoring that into our long-term model at this point. But it is early, it\u2019s something we\u2019re adapting on a regular basis. We do think it could have some impact. It probably will have some impact. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be enough to take us off our full year gross margin target of 60% at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Tim Long : Thank you. Two questions if I could. Rami, maybe you can update us, I think Ken mentioned something about the strength in the cloud vertical and still looking for some of those 400-gig wins in the hyperscalers. So could you kind of update us on progress there, and maybe if you could just work in kind of what you\u2019re seeing across that customer base and the rest of the customer base as far as white boxing as a risk? And then secondly on the Service Provider side, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, obviously Huawei does have some struggles and Nokia seems to be struggling a little bit as well across their businesses. So can you talk about in the context of a favorable industry backdrop, how you see kind of competitive advantages at this point? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Sure, Tim. So let\u2019s start with the cloud provider space in particular 400-gig. Things are progressing very well and 400-gig I feel increasingly confident that we\u2019re going to be able to win 400-gig footprint and this is a broader market in across both the hyperscale cloud providers, as well as the Tier-2, 3 or the cloud major, cloud providers as well. Now that the competitive solutions are out in the market, the competitive bake-offs are happening, we sort of get a good feel of what\u2019s out there and how the differentiation we had hoped to achieve is actually fairing out with practical testing and I feel good. I mean let\u2019s just say that. We\u2019re winning especially in wide area use cases. And this is across both the hyperscale as well as the smaller cloud provider. And then even in the data center, we\u2019ve one 400-gig data center use cases. We\u2019re not yet ready to announce a hyperscale 400-gig data center win at this point, but we\u2019re going to continue to aggressively go after the full market that\u2019s out there, both wide area and data center. And on the SP competitive front, there \u2013 our solutions, our strategy is very much based on the strengths and the merits of our own products, our wide area capabilities, our automation capabilities and I feel very good about that. We\u2019ve listened closely to our customers. We understand what they want. And I think we were delivering solutions and have delivered solutions that addresses their biggest needs and requirements. With Huawei sort of issue that\u2019s out there and whether that presents an opportunity for us? The answer is yes. I think we do see some opportunities right now. The results of some concerns about Huawei, they\u2019re going to sort of play out in time. This is never going to be a sort of an overnight thing, share shift typically happens in time frames of the year, but the good news is, we do see that there are opportunities and customers that are rethinking some of the decisions that they have made in specific geographies around the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the security kind of segment that you alluded to, I mean just in \u2013 I guess how far integrated or how far down the pipeline, are you in integrating 128 into kind of the portfolio, so that it can be kind of a cross-sell and cross-Mist in the Enterprise portfolio? And then just with the security portfolio have grown year-over-year without the inclusion of 128? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, so let me start and then Ken you can add some more colors on the specific question. So 128 has become an integral part of our AI-driven enterprise strategy, which is really around everything from client to cloud with ease of automation, simplicity of day-to-day provisioning and there is a security architecture element to this, because it provides visibility into applications, it integrates seamlessly with our on-prem security offering. And then over time as we introduce more cloud-based security offerings that will integrate seamlessly with that, and so that has \u2013 still early days with 128 Technology. But as I mentioned, the win rate is solid, the customer interest is solid, the pipeline that\u2019s being built is solid. And I have a lot of confidence that it\u2019s going to be a successful acquisition in the long-term. Ken Miller : Yes. Security all up, which includes products and services grew 11% in the quarter. Products actually grew better more than services, services had modest growth, products actually was driving most of that 11% growth. And yes, it would have grown without 128 T. In fact, all three of the recent acquisitions Apstra, 128 T, as well as a Netrounds, accounted for less than 10% of revenue in the quarter. On track to the full year plan, we expect it to be about a point in aggregate of growth for Juniper. So call it $45 million or so in total revenue for the year. So we\u2019re on track for that although Q1 was less than $10 million as expected. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I realize this is probably a relatively small part of your revenue stream, but I wanted to ask about your exposure in the rural broadband market. Obviously, lots and lots of new stimulus dollars coming into that space, certainly needs there, I think in terms of the LAN piece and routing piece. Can you just talk about what percentage of sales might be coming from that end market and how you might see that growing going forward? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, I don\u2019t even know if we have that figure off the top of our head. Maybe Ken can pull something up, but I\u2019ll tell you this, we\u2019ve actually had over the last two years or so as part of the sales restructuring that we did a deliberate focus on Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers with an eye on tapping into some of the broadband sort of rural stimulus dollars that are making their way into the market. So there is no doubt that Biden\u2019s infrastructure deal, if it actually manages to pass, is going to present some opportunities for us. And I think we\u2019re well prepared for it. It really is \u2013 it\u2019s not a matter of technology. We\u2019ve got the goods, we\u2019ve got the products, we have the solution. Automation in fact becomes especially important for the rural areas where typically you are going to just have to deal with a lot more density of products in sparse geographical areas, but I think it\u2019s just a matter or sort of seeing the stimulus dollars actually weave their way into actual spending. Ken Miller : Yes. Unfortunately, we do not break out our business, our automated WAN solutions business in that way. So we can\u2019t share with you the numbers, but as Rami mentioned, we\u2019re focused on diversifying that business. And we\u2019ve seen tremendous success over the last couple of years diversifying and I think we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for giving me the slot to ask a question. One thing, Ken, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about the cloud growth, and that the new guide, I may have misheard you but you said that the way it\u2019s trending, is coming in at the higher end of your long-term growth model with a cloud customer. And I know you kind of gave some granular data points regarding the revenue outlook and the Service Provider flat to slightly up, kind of I think that was the message. Could you just kind of give us the same kind of dynamic or unpack it for Cloud so to just get a better idea on what that vector looks like as it pertains to the company? Ken Miller : Yes, absolutely. So at Investor Day, we talked about Cloud, the long-term model for Cloud being plus 1% to 5%, so 1% to 5% growth on a kind of a three-year CAGR basis, our long-term model basis. This year, we actually expect to be the high-end of that range. So we\u2019re thinking closer to their 4% to 5% range, or higher end of that 1% to 5%, based on the strength we\u2019re seeing at the start of the year. Previously for Cloud, our previous guidance for the year was just, it would be growth, right. And now we\u2019re actually quantifying it to the high end of that kind of 1% to 5% range. That\u2019s a change from 90 days ago. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lloyd with UBS. You may proceed with your question. David Lloyd : Great. Thanks, guys. And if you guys covered this I apologize. My line went off for a little bit. Can you \u2013 Ken, can you kind of touch on the contribution from the acquisitions in the first quarter, and whether that show up, I\u2019m assuming most of it showed up in the Enterprise segment and it sounds like it was somewhere between $5 million and $10 million? And then just a quick follow-up on this weighing out there, but I think about sort of the commentary for the full year guidance, does it imply based on your Cloud and Service Provider commentary that some of the back half of the year. Enterprise revenue growth should be sort of double-digits, that\u2019s sort of what you\u2019re intimating by sort of the guidance that you laid out there? Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes. So on the acquisition front, I mean we \u2013 for Q1, the revenue was less than $10 million in aggregate, in line with our expectations for the quarter. So we\u2019re off to a strong start, but Q1 was less than $10 million. So relatively immaterial, and most of that would have showed up in Enterprise, given the customers, accelerate the products predominantly being cloud-ready data center and AI-driven Enterprise oriented revenue products. We\u2019re still on track for the full year to get to a 1% in aggregate growth across $45 million, give or take for the year, from revenue perspective. And we do think these acquisitions as we said before will be dilutive in FY2021 by about $0.05, and that\u2019s something that we expect to pressure in the second half and actually be accretive here in 2022. So while they are a bit of a drag on overall earnings this year, we expect them to enable us to expand margins in 2022 and beyond. Second part of your question, I\u2019m sorry, one was about the acquisitions. What was the second part of your question? David Lloyd : When you think about the rest of the guidance, does that imply sort of Enterprise revenue in sort of double digits in the back half of this year, given sort of where Cloud will be in terms of either for the rest of the year? Ken Miller : Yes, I mean so Enterprise we expect to be our fastest growing vertical. I think if you do the math, you\u2019re going to get to kind of the numbers you\u2019re talking about. We expect it to be our fastest growing vertical. We do believe AI-driven Enterprise will be double-digit growth, cloud-ready data center, we talked about being toward the middle of the long-term model, which is kind of high-single digit growth. And those are predominantly Enterprise, although, we obviously sell those solutions to Service Provider as well as Cloud. Jess Lubert : Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. You may proceed with your question. Alex Henderson : Thank you very much. So when you guys start talking about Mist, you spent a fair amount of time talking about how it generates upsell into other products imposed through a multiple of the initial sales over time. I haven\u2019t really heard much update on that. In fact, if anything in the last quarter, it seemed like it had been at the lower end of the multiple benefit. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of upsell you\u2019re seeing and I get it that it\u2019s become an architectural sale, but to what extent there is an upsell around what has traditionally been more standardized products like rackables switches and so forth? Rami Rahim : Yes, let me start and then maybe Ken you can add some more color. I honestly I\u2019m scratching my head a little bit about where your comments around sort of slowdown. We don\u2019t see anything of that nature in the AI-driven Enterprise where Mist plays. I did mention in my prepared remarks, that if you take a look at orders for Mist all up, that includes all Mist products, right, the wireless, wired switching, associated software capabilities it doubled on a year-over-year basis, and it\u2019s no longer a small business for Juniper, and really it\u2019s now starting to contribute meaningfully. The innovation is phenomenal here. I mean the pace of innovation, we just announced and launched in fact and we\u2019ll ship very shortly, if we haven\u2019t already, a new breed of campus wired switch in the form of EX4400, which is our first true cloud native, Mist-optimized wired switch that\u2019s intended for rapid, fast adoption, zero touch provisioning, all the aspects of the Mist solution that you\u2019ve come to expect and love and their access points now applying to this next generation wired solution, and that\u2019s just us really pouring fuel on the fire of the AI-driven business that is essentially powered entirely by Mist today. Ken Miller : Yes, I would just add that we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our EX pull-through related to Mist is actually a record in Q1. So we have a lot of EX that we\u2019re selling are because of the Mist kind of solution is actually the all-time high. And we\u2019re obviously continuing to sell more subscriptions as well, and the subscriptions, they don\u2019t show up in revenue right way, obviously they are recognized gradually over time. So a big part of our ARR growth that we mentioned of 28%, is also very much tied to the full Mist solution, not just necessarily the Wi-Fi. So in aggregate we talked about in Investor Day that we think the lifetime value of the kind of the pull-through, if you will, the non-wireless LAN solution is about 2.5 times the Wi-Fi business. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re still in very early innings of that. And we\u2019re still leading largely with Mist itself, and then pulling through the rest of the solution. But as we see the lifetime value and these customers continue to grow with EX and other parts of the portfolio. We feel confident in that kind of 2.5 times ratio that we put out there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : Thanks, guys. Appreciate you squeezing me in. Question for Ken or question for Rami or both of you, total gross margin, it sounds, if you already stated this, I apologize, but it from what I read it doesn\u2019t sound like, but it seems your guidance. But if I go back to last quarter, you did sell more constructive looking out beyond this year. Any changes you\u2019re thinking about where gross margin could go and what timeframe? Ken Miller : So you\u2019re right. We have not changed our guidance for gross margin. We did change our guidance for revenue. We increased it by a point and we\u2019re not bringing gross margin up, and typically you would expect with volume, you would see some increase in gross margin and some of the reason for that Paul, is some of these supply constraints, some of the semiconductor shortages, we are factoring in some incremental costs and quite honestly, there is still some uncertainty there. So I just want to, at this point we\u2019re keeping our margin targets the same. Beyond this year, I think on things we control like software mix and optimization within our services organization, et cetera. I feel very good. That said, some of the things that have less control on whether it be COVID-related freight costs or even some of these semiconductor shortages, it makes it very cloudy. So at this point, we have really no update beyond this year. We expect to be able to manage to the 60% target for this year, but beyond that, really no change to our outlook at this point. Rami Rahim : And Paul we have... Operator : Ladies and gentlemen... Rami Rahim : I think Paul, he had a question for me, but maybe we lost him already. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over for closing remarks. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Network's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President Investor Relations. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2021 results. We reported better than expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across vertical customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improved trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million especially in the Enterprise vertical. I would call out three factors driving our momentum. First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience what we call experience first networking is resonating in the market. Our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that is enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the enterprise campus and the data center markets. But also in Service Provider and Cloud verticals. By leveraging software control point like Mist, Astra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience. We are not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platform that pulls through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As a global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming and many new ones are starting Cloud and Service Provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers, especially in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers longer-term plan as a positive development.  Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis, despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. Our strategy is down and we are investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwinds over the next few years. The first area, we're winning is the enterprise transition to AI driven cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless, and since the acquisition we have brought the same automation insight and agility to the wired land and now the win. This unique client to cloud approach for AI [ph] off delivered superior end user and operator experiences which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as WiFi, wired SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with the large existing accounts. While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time including a purpose-built microservices cloud architecture, sixth generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the LAN wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI driven support led by the industry's only conversational assistant, Marvis. This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue at the $20 billion campus and branch market transition to AI driven cloud architecture in the years to come.  We're also continuing to see success with our 400G offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across Hyperscale, Service Provider and Cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture net new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400G deployment to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. In addition, we are optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as ACX metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new Metro portfolio and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. Now, I'd like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a Customer Solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution. While revenue slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment.  We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400G solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprints, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year with supply to likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. Our Cloud-Ready Data Center solution has experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over a $1 million after exceeded expectations for its second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market. This is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins.  Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. For the year, we believe our Cloud-Ready Data Center business is now tracking at to slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. Finally, our AI driven Enterprise Solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market, as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our Mistified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated DX pull through nearly doubled year-over-year and we saw another quarter of record. I believe the Mist pull through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX4400, a groundbreaking new access that combines true enterprise grade, scalability and performance with the ease of AI driven cloud operations. Mist also positively impacted our Branch Security business, which performed well in Q2. And we continue to make progress with 128 technology, which we are integrating with our SRX secure branch gateways under a common cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD WAN opportunities remains strong thanks to these technology differences coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud Enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation, insight and action. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continued to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI driven enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals.  We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market leading differentiation, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI driven enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our Security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and those product families. Our Connected Security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our Security business to achieve our growth objectives. Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2, as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions, solid updates of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box Flex licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period, driven by combination of Mist subscriptions, ratable security software offerings and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. Based on the momentum we're seeing we remain confident in the long term Software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis, due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of [indiscernible] orders during the second quarter, with significant strength across all verticals and Customer Solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. With year-over-year growth across all verticals and Customer Solutions. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis Service Provider grew 2%, Cloud grew 12% and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. From a Customer Solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year. While PTX product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. Cloud Ready Data Center revenue increased 28% year-over-year, as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. And finally, AI driven enterprise revenue increased to 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. Total Security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security Product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, Forever Cloud, Fiber Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better than expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter, which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, Which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital returns perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance, as I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time we believe we will have access to sufficient for Senect [ph] Vector supply to meet our full year financial forecast. Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period, despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full-year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better than expected Q2 results and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full-year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%, Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9% and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and cost related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full-year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Please proceed. Joseph Cardoso : Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So my first question here is on the guide. You reiterated your guide for Service Provider revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year, which implies revenue for that vertical is likely to decline or to be flat in the second half of the year which optically would appear conservative given the expectations for Service Providers to ramp spending into the second half of this year. Can you help bridge that variance there and maybe how that thinking is wrong? And then I have a follow up. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, let me start, Joe, and then maybe Ken would like the WAN. So we had a solid first half of the year for Service Provider. Our Q1 performance was exceptional, Q2 was also I think in line with expectations. We're entering the second half of the year with solid backlog. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing across the business internationally, and both those tier 1 Service Providers strength in this country, in the US, also encouraged by the number of wins, 400G, wins which aren't really contributing to revenue in a very meaningful way yet, but I expect that to change in the second half of the year. Technology strong, new products both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up, certainly a great start of the year. There are a lot of dynamics around the second half of the year supply being one element of that dynamic that we just have to keep a watchful eye on. And all of that has been into the outlook that we provided for the SP segment. Ken, you want for? Ken Miller : Yes, I would just reiterate that supply constraints are factored into our full year guide. To your point, Joe, the full-year guide is unchanged. We are seeing stronger-than-expected bookings. So the momentum is quite strong, that's resulting in improved visibility, improved backlog levels. That said, because of the supply constraints, we feel at this time keeping the guide kind of where it was on a full-year basis is the most prudent thing to do. That visibility and increased backlog will ultimately result in revenue for us, but at this point we see that perhaps beyond this year. Joseph Cardoso : Got it. Appreciate the color. And then my second question is on the supply shortages. Given that the supply shortages appear to be here today for a couple of quarters, curious to hear if you guys are pulling on any levers to offset it like price increases or if you plan on passing on any pricing to customers and whether any of that is baked into the better top line we're seeing here. Rami Rahim : Yes, so we have recently adjusted some price -- list price and changes for our products. We do that periodically. We did a pretty significant uplift in many of our products in the Q2 time frame. That will take some time to play through. As you know, we do have a fair amount of backlog that was on previous pricing levels, but still need to kind of ship. But as we continue to increase our bookings going forward, we should see a positive impact from our recent pricing changes. It wasn't across the board for all products, but it was a good percentage of our products in an attempt to offset some of the pressures we're seeing but it will play out over a fair period of time. Something we do periodically, making sure we have the right price for the right value that we deliver to our customers is something we're very focused on and something that we expect to play out in the form of improved profitability over time. It didn't have an impact on Q2 results, the price change came towards the end of the second quarter and really will play out over the next several quarters rather than have any impact on Q2. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you. I was hoping to unpack the gross margin dynamics a little bit. It sounds as though we should be thinking 59.5% for the third quarter and fourth quarter. At the same time, it also sounded like the intensity of the supply constraints was most acute in the third quarter. So maybe little pricing increase plus [indiscernible] just mean that higher volume in the fourth quarter ought to be higher? Ken Miller : Yes, so Q3, we definitely think that supply constraints are particularly tight, and we mentioned that on the prepared remarks and obviously factor that into our guidance. Both our top line guidance as well as our gross margin guidance. Q4, while we haven't given specific Q4 gross margin guidance, we have provided the full year and I think your math is pretty directionally correct where it applies somewhat flattish Q4 as compared to Q3. That said, it's a little bit too early to call with any more specificity than that. We do expect the volume to be up. Our software mix should be up, which would be obviously tailwinds and potentially positive drivers to gross margin improvement, potential gross margin improvement. However, given the supply dynamics and the quite honestly the unknown aspects as we continue to work through this, we think it's prudent to kind of keep the guidance where we have it on a full year basis. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, thank you. And my second question would be on the visibility that you have. It's nice to be in a position having a little bit additional visibility than usual. On the other hand, that invites questions like this one. How durable do you think the relative strength in your revenues are for this year? And these trends that should persist into 2022 and beyond, or do you think that this is a little bit of a cyclical uptick for us all? Rami Rahim : Yes, let me start. It's a good question. We're entering the second half of this year with really strong momentum. What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos. It cuts across our Customer Solutions. It cuts across the vertical segments. So we're firing on all cylinders on that front. There is definitely a COVID related element where customers are, let's say, making sure that they're getting ahead of potential supply constraints. But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demands on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well, so we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the markets. So, those -- that improved market condition to something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective. I have confidence that the combination of market dynamics and our own execution, product differentiation, go-to-market strength is all going to work for us on a sustainable basis. Ken Miller : Yes. And from a revenue perspective, I would say that our durability for revenue growth is actually having a stronger belief that that's going to happen, then I would have had to say a few quarters ago given the bookings that we saw. So clearly the booking strength in the first half is setting us up well with an increased backlog, increased visibility in second half, which gives me confidence that our revenue strength that we've seen in the first half of 8% growth is going to result in a very solid year. We've raised the year now to 6% on a full-year basis, the second time this year since February that we've raised the full-year guidance on the revenue side, and part of that confidence is the strength we're seeing and the momentum that we have pretty much across the board. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Bala Reddy : Hi, this is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, congrats on good quarter and guide here. I don't think we touched on geography here. Now EMEA has been strong the last year quarters, but if you look at Americas the number is -- the number looks good here. Could you may be tie this thing to different verticals and see if we are expecting to see an improvement in, let's say, Service Provider because of the stronger Telco CapEx guidance? And I have a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the question. So the strength that we've seen in Q2 is broad based. It cuts across every geography. The Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. You're right. EMEA has been especially strong, growing 10% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame and that is true -- we saw growth across all verticals and all solution areas in EMEA. But even in the Americas, we saw growth in every vertical and we saw special strength in Data Center opportunities and the AI driven enterprise opportunities across those verticals. And in Asia Pacific, I think we are executing extremely well there as well with growth in the Cloud vertical, in the Enterprise, and strength in Data Center, AI driven enterprise solutions. So I'm very encouraged, as I just mentioned earlier, with the diversity of the strength that we're seeing across geographies. There is definitely a market dynamic where things are working to our favor, but I think there's a result of this -- the fact that we are executing extremely well to capture that market opportunity. Bala Reddy : Okay. Secondly on the natural opportunity in Service Provider. So if we talk about ACX new products and looks like there are more products that you plan to launch in the near term. Could you talk about the interest levels that you are seeing there? I know this is [indiscernible] opportunities in Italy new for Juniper. So could you maybe give some more insight on the past? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, absolutely. I'm quite frankly very excited about the Metro opportunity and the solutions that we're bringing to market today. We already have elements of that solution or available shipping with very solid early entrant. Despite the fact that the solution is not really fully complete we plan to round out that solution over the next year, year and a half or so with more and more products that will enter into the market. I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the Service Provider segment for next year. And again there is a very important elements of our automated WAN solution that is software, and this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time. So the net of it is, I think it's going to be a wonderful opportunity for us and I'm quite bullish about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Irvin Liu : Hi, thanks. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I also had a question and a follow up. And on the topic of the constraint semiconductor supply environment, I was wondering if you can perhaps quantify what sort of impact this had on your Q2 revenue and on your forward revenue guidance as well? Essentially, if supply shortages impact your ability to fulfill orders. And from a gross margin perspective, do you see supply headwinds improving or deteriorating versus the 50 basis point headwind you saw in June? Rami Rahim : Yes, maybe I'll start and then Ken you can talk a little bit about what color we can provide in terms of quantification. It's clearly a worldwide shortage. It's affecting many industries, not just IT and networking. It has resulted in extended lead times, but quite frankly all of our customers have now come to expect these challenges and as a result of that they providing us with much better visibility into their future purchasing and that's a very good trend for us quite frankly, especially in this constrained environment. And I -- just while I have you. Our supply chain team has been doing a phenomenal job, all things considered, navigating these challenges which change from a month over month to week over-week basis sometimes in terms of where those constraints are. And I personally have been very much involved in trying to alleviate challenges by working with our strategic partners. And I'll let Ken there start from there. Ken Miller : Yes, so from a revenue perspective, I don't believe it impacted our Q2 results materially. We're very pleased with the results we posted of $1.172 billion, which is towards the high end of our range. Obviously, the profitability metrics were also quite strong in Q2. So I don't believe it had an impact on our future results. That said, it is something we're considering as we set the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. We did increase the full year revenue guidance again for the second time this year up to 6% full year year-on-year growth and previously we were at 4% to 5%. So we are able to secure the supply, at least we believe we'll be able to secure the supply to go ahead and increase our revenue guidance. So it's not impacting us very negatively. However, it is part of that guide. We are definitely considering our ability to secure supply when we set our forward guidance. From a gross margin perspective, what's happening as we talked on the last call, at this point in time we clearly knew it on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of supply constraints. But we also expected at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with the increased component costs that we're seeing and the expedite fees, et cetera has resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. So, I do believe these are temporary transitory costs if you will. they should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in the quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover this in the longer term and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion, as well as earnings growth to be faster revenue. So we -- the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures, as these pressures alleviate they just allow us to double down on our profitability goals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed. Tim Long : Thank you, and two if I could as well. First, I did want to go back to the kind of this Q4 implied revenue guidance. I understand the supply chain impacts, but it does seem like you guys were able to kind of beat numbers on the top line the last two quarters. So you were able to fight through that somewhat. Sounds like you have supply for the year and clearly the orders are there. So maybe what's changing with the ability to continue with mid-single or mid to high single-digit growth in Q4 compared to what you were able to do in the prior two quarters? And then secondly, if we could just dig a little bit more into the enterprise. Rami, you talked about the million dollar deals. Can you just give us an update there? Maybe scale that a little bit, talk a little bit about win rates and where you are with salesforce. Is this more to grow from here or is it also getting more at-bats? If you can give us an update on Enterprise. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, maybe I'll start with the second question first and then Ken I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related question. So, Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance and we have been doing well, performing well through -- from of the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There is no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better and elements of the Enterprise market that have essentially shut down. Like take for example, traditional [ph]carpeted enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge and that will open up net new opportunities for us and it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven enterprise, of course missed being a very important component of that. But I also want to emphasize that there is another leg to the Enterprise stool and that is Data Center. Now we've always done quite well in the Data Center space and the Enterprise, but I think now with the addition of the Astra Team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So, from a Mist standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist Solutions revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, grew at nearly 2X year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we are now over $400 million. So, it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Astra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations and quite frankly the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So, I think that Astra and the Data Center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019. Ken Miller : Yes. And on the Q4 guide perspective. as you mentioned, Tim, we had a very solid first half, Beat our midpoint of guidance, both in Q1 and Q2, raised guidance in Q2, and raised again in Q3 here on this call and raised the full-year at 6%. So we're pleased with the execution and the momentum we're seeing on the revenue side. That said, supply constraints are tighter now than they were in the first half. A lot of this has to do with our own inventory levels. And clearly we were anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stock, some of the redundancy efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and they're going to continue to help us in the second half. However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis and Q3. So, I'm pretty pleased with the result. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we build, not only are we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY21, but it is likely to leak into FY22 as well. So, I think it gives us a good head start, this bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now, there's a line for a solid 6% revenue growth, well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed. Alex Henderson : Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to clarify a few things. You just stated the earlier question that you didn't see any impact to your numbers from the supply chain. And I think that that's kind of a misstatement. Clearly you did, but it may have been in line with what you had expected. Therefore, you're saying we didn't see a variance from our expectations. And I don't think that was the question that was asked. I think the question was asked was if you had no supply constraints, how much impact would it -- how much larger would the revenues have been? So could you clarify that point because I think you're answering a different question than what he was asking and what analysts probably heard relative to that key question. The other thing I wanted to clarify is you give growth rates in software, both in revenues and ARR, you also gave revenue growth in security products. Can you give us what the organic growth rates were on those two? Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes, I'll take this one. So from a -- yes, just to clarify. The comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So, we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right in that we -- the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2.  The one area that is impacting the results and we called it out in prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So, yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. On the organic, we don't break out in organic versus non-organic . I'm trying to understand when you say non-organic, are you really referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last three quarters or so, and I can tell you those are on track. We're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add a point of revenue growth. So that's is in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers on a quarterly basis aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and-or our security growth. They're a significant minority as compared to the strength we have on our Security business and our Software business. They are a big part of our future, both Software as well as Security, but to-date the Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there is a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the Software side in particular, zero impact to Security. But on the Software side, Mist is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a service business, which is embedded in that number. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed. Simon Leopold : Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to first ask about the Cloud vertical in particular and essentially the group that we often refer to as the Tier-2, Tier-3 cloud builders, and just for illustrative purposes, I'm thinking of operators like Oracle and IBM. So not the hyperscalers. I want to confirm first of all that you would put those kinds of operators in your Cloud segment that's not as opposed to the Enterprise or Service Provider segment. And then regardless of where you put them, how do you see that group of the smaller Cloud builders behaving for you? How material are they in your business and how are they spending with you? And then, I've got a follow-up. Rami Rahim : Sure, Simon. Let me start. So first, we had a phenomenal Cloud quarter in Q2. It was a record quarter for us in that timeframe. Our cloud orders in fact were up over 100% year-over-year. So we're seeing real great strength there and it's broad based. We indicated in the last quarter that there has been a resumption of spend by our largest cloud provider customer that continued into the Q2 timeframe, but it also is true for the rest of the hyperscale customers as well as what we define as cloud majors, so Tier-2, Tier-3 cloud providers where the defined as customers whose businesses depend on deliver -- delivering some sort of cloud services; it continues from there. Momentum and strength double digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing WAN and Data Center. And then 400G wins. the momentum we're seeing in 400G wins across large Tier-1 hyperscale customers, as well as the broader cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And there I would say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system it's evolved to our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiated, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design points that we have chosen that we've decided on, are actually paying off for us. So this is why all up, we're now anticipating that we're going to grow faster than the full year guide that we provided for Cloud provider in the last Analyst Day. Simon Leopold : Thanks. And then just my follow up is, on the surface the product mix this quarter was unfavorable relative to what we would expect in terms of gross margin. Because normally routing has the better than average gross margin. So I'm -- in managing that you're Software business is contributing more favorably or disproportionately to Data Center and Enterprise segments and that's helping those segments have better gross margin than they have historically. I don't necessarily need some complete breakdown of Software by segment. But could you help us understand the distribution of Software in the reported segments? Ken Miller : Yes. So, I do -- you are right in that our software mix absolutely did help overall gross margin. Mix is the biggest determinant, product and-or vertical is a highly correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where your more advantage than other periods of time, maybe they're geographic, as an example, where we did have a higher margin and say the US Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there is a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix in aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly off box higher margin software is a little more as a percentage a little higher in our Enterprise -- our Cloud Ready Data Center AI driven enterprise businesses than it is our traditional service provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and as less margin impact overall. So that is part of the mix going forward. And last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw very strong Services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. The product margin came in largely in line with our expectations. Even with the mix shift that you're talking about, the Services exceeded our expectations which resulted in the overall increase from mid-point. Jess Lubert : Operator, we're going to take two more questions. Operator : Okay. Our next question this is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. The first thing I just wanted to ask was regarding some of the orders that some of your customers are submitting earlier than they normally would, I think you made that comment, Rami. Have most of your customers have been doing this with most of the networking equipment vendor base? And a follow up to that is, is there any optionality the customers have to potentially postpone or full on cancel their order in the event that another vendor is able to deliver on any kind of routing or networking equipment? Rami Rahim : Yes, hi, Sami. Thanks for the question. I think the first question. sorry, I've already forgotten the first question. Ken Miller : Are orders getting earlier. Rami Rahim : Yes. I think very difficult for me to comment on what is -- what our customers are seeing from our peers in the industry. All I know is it's very likely that the demand, sorry the supply constraints and the challenges are broad based. They're felt across our peers, they're felt across the entire industry and many other industries. We have to understand that these supply constraints are very high upstream in the overall supply chain, all the way to the silicon fabrication houses that are around the world. So it's most likely the case that our customers are seeing very similar trends from all of our peers in the industry. Ken Miller : Yes. And our orders are cancellable. However, most orders would come with cancellation fee if a customer returns to cancel. And I would say that our history of cancellations is extremely low. We're quite confident in the strength of our backlog. We do not expect that cancellation activity to increase in any sort of significant way. And we feel that customers are just giving us advance or giving us better visibility to their true deployment needs as they're aware of our published lead times obviously and they want to make sure they get their orders in our hands in time for us to deliver against those stated goals. So I don't expect there to be any sort of disruption to our backlog or bookings from a cancellation perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you all squeezing me in. A couple clarifications. I apologize if this is repetitive of what's been said before. My line has come in and out. On the pricing, on pricing, any meaningful change, Ken? Ken Miller : Yes, we did change a fair amount of our products in Q2 time frame, late in Q2, we did increase list prices. I don't want to say across the board, Paul, but in a majority of our products we did see a price increase in Q2. That's going to play out over the next couple quarters, but it is something we did do in Q2. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate that. And then, Rami, if I understood you correctly, maybe I didn't, but with respect to the web scalers, did I understand you to say that you have product wins with the web scalers? I assume you're talking about other than intra-data center switching, the related question was where they the primary driver, not the only driver of the improved outlook? Ken Miller : So from a quarter standpoint, I think that the trends and the momentum are broad based, certainly they're very strong in the Cloud provider space. But from an order standpoint, double-digit growth in Service Provider, double-digit growth in Enterprise as well. And then I just provided you with a color of over 100% growth in order in the Cloud Provider segment. So, clearly it's broad based and it's very encouraging and it bodes well for future quarters in terms of revenue. In terms of visibility that we have. You're right, in terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN an inter data center that is not yet intra data center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue. And the rest of the Cloud Provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, Data Center Interconnect as well as inside of the Data Center. Rami Rahim : Okay. So I think that was our last question and maybe I'd like to close with just a couple of thoughts. I'm very encouraged by the momentum in the business. I like the diversity and the strength that we are seeing it speaks to our strategy, it speaks to the smart investments that we're making, it speaks to the strong execution by the team which I'm very proud of. I believe that our end markets are recovering and that we're set up to benefit from that recovery. And I also think that the demand strength that we're building as well as the backlog that we have now allows it -- sets us up to deliver greater improvements in profitability next year, especially as some of the transitory supply chain related costs start to recede. So this remains a very important focus area for myself and my management team. And with that, I just want to thank you all for your time and the confidence in us. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a great day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host. Jess Lubert, you may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon. And welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2021 results. We experienced very strong demand during the September quarter and delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, even though supply chain challenges impacted revenue in the period.  Orders saw another quarter of mid-teens year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead time. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter. And our ending backlog is now increased by more than $1 billion at compared to year-end 2020. Order momentum was strong [Indiscernible] vertical, customer solution, and geographies. With each of these categories experiencing growth well into double-digit territory.  Needless to say, our team is executing extremely well. Our strategy is working. And investments we have made in technologies that enhance customer operations and improve the end user experience, what we call experience-first networking are allowing us to differentiate across the markets we serve. we serve.  This technical differentiation along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization are paying off and enabling us to take share and capitalize on some of the big market transitions that are beginning to unfold across the verticals we serve.  This is particularly true in the enterprise market, where customers are increasingly recognizing the value delivered by platforms such as Mist and Astra, that dramatically reduced deployment time, eliminate trouble ticket, and reduced meantime to resolution for network problems.  These platforms are not only enabling us to win new logos in the campus and the datacenter, but also to pull through other Juniper products that present meaningful opportunities to expand with customers over time. In the Cloud and service provider vertical, we're seeing strong early adoption of our 400-gig capable platform due to the strength of our Juniper bulk operating system, our differentiated silicon capabilities, and the deep engagement we maintained with these important customers.  These factors are not only enabling us to maintain our core franchises, but also to secure new footprint, including a large new Hyperscale wind deployment that should present tailwinds for our business over the next few years.  I'm also encouraged by the early customer interest in our metro routing portfolio, which did direct a large and fast-growing market where historically we have in place. We expect this opportunity to steadily ramp through the course of next year as new products come to market and service provider 5G investments steadily increase.  The bottom line is that I remain very optimistic regarding our future prospects despite the supply chain challenges we are currently navigating. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory in nature. And the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed set's us up extremely well to deliver improved growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond.  While it remains early, and we'll provide a more detailed 2022 outlook when we report our Q4 results based on current backlog and the August strength we're continuing to see in the market. We currently expect to deliver at least mid-single digit sales growth and at least a point of Operating Margin Expansion in 2022.  Our expectations for 2022 do not assume a material improvement in supply chain constraints. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective.  Starting with our automated WAN solutions, while revenue declined year-over-year due entirely to supply chain constraints, we experienced another quarter of strong order growth with solid momentum in both our service provider and Cloud segment.  We saw healthy demand across both our NF and PTF product family and strong adoption of our newer products, as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabled us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure new wins that includes several large opportunities with our Cloud customers, including the hybrid scale opportunity I previously referenced.  Driven in part by these opportunities, our Cloud orders saw a second consecutive quarter up triple-digit growth year-over-year. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated LAN solution, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges.  As a result, we continue to expect revenue from this segment to be within the range of our long-term model calling for a 1% decline to a 3% growth this year despite the strong demand, we are seeing. Our Cloud-Ready Data Center solutions experienced 26% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3, and another quarter of encouraging order trends from our Cloud enterprise and service provider customers.  We continued to see strong momentum with new logos and deal greater than $1 million. As I mentioned last quarter, Astra is creating a significant buzz in the market, which is not only leading to more software opportunities, but also full-stack datacenter wins. Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high. And we continue to be optimistic about the outlook of this business. Based on the momentum we are seeing; our Cloud ready datacenter business is now tracking to meet or exceed the high end of our long-term model looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year.  Finally, our AI driven enterprise solutions significantly outpaced the market and grew 35% Year-over-year. Our mid AI differentiation continues to win in the market as wireless orders experienced another record quarter with triple digit growth and a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our mystified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through, nearly doubled year-over-year. And we experienced record EX pull-through in the period. With this pull-through revenue growing more than 200% year-over-year.  This momentum enabled EX to achieve the highest level of sales since 2014. We expect this momentum to continue in future quarters as customers increasingly recognize the value of AI driven Cloud operations, including new and innovative features such as EVPN - VXLAN fabric management in the Mist Cloud, which has launched this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our mystified revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. We're also seeing very positive results with our AI -driven SD-WAN solution, which earned Juniper distinction as the only visionary in the Gartner WAN Edge Magic Quadrant published last quarter.  We saw a record quarter for our Session Smart Router portfolio acquired from 128 technology with triple-digit year-over-year growth and [Indiscernible] in various sectors like retail and banking, plus especially strong traction with the federal government. In addition, branch SRX developed last quarter hit a two-year high.  The pipeline for our AI-driven SD-WAN is strong, as both prospects and partners are gravitating towards the unique benefits provided by Juniper AI off with assured client to Cloud experiences. We are particularly encouraged by the number of full stack multi-million-dollar wins we're seeing in the campus and branch.  Where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access, and [ inaudible 00 :10:45] retailer and leading international construction company in Europe and managed services providers in North America and Europe. This highlights the value of our AI driven enterprise offerings to customers and partners across all verticals and all Geo's.  We believe that this AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation, including self-driving operation and predictive actions driven by our virtual network assistant, Marvis, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I am very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in this business. And now we expect our AI driven enterprise solution to see at least 20% growth in 2021.  Our security revenue experienced strong results in Q3, with total revenue growing 9% year-over-year. Product revenue increasing by 16% year-over-year, which marks a third consecutive quarter of double-digit product growth. Strength with broad-based across our high-end, mid-range and branch SRX products, as well as our virtual SRX offerings.  Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage. And we continue to receive third-party accolades on our solutions from organizations such as ICFA and Net fax open often besting all competitors in head-to-head tech.  We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software momentum, accelerated in Q3.  Software and related services revenue grew 67% year-over-year as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses, and strong sales of certain perpetual onbox licenses. ARR grew 34% year-over-year, driven by a combination of mid subscription, ratable security software offering, and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced a record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and customer solutions. Momentum is strong in both rattible subscriptions offerings, as well as on bluff flex licenses.  Based on the momentum we're seeing, we're currently tracking ahead of the long-term total software and ARR target we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis, due to strong renewal and service to tax rate.  Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners, and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper.  I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and [Indiscernible] some color on our Outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2021 at $1 billion 189 million in revenue.  Slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, but up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The modest revenue shortfall as compared to our guidance, was due to the negative impact of supply chain constraints.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46 in line with our guidance. During the third quarter, momentum and product orders remained strong, showing exceptional year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter.  We saw significant order growth across all verticals, all geographies, and all customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed.  Even, after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown in the mid-teens year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of mid-teens bookings growth after adjusting for early orders. It's important to mention that our backlog has increased by more than $1 billion relative to the start of the year.  Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud grew 20% Enterprise grew 7%, and service provider declined 6%. We've got double-digit Year-over-year order growth in service provider. However, the timing of shipments due to supply constraints impacted revenue.  Turning to customer solutions on a Year-over-year basis, Cloud-Ready Data Center increased 26% and AI-driven enterprise increased 35%. Automated Land Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by supply constraints and declined 12% Year-over-year. However, orders grew double-digits versus the last year.  Total software and related services revenue were $204 million, which was an increase of 67% Year-over-year and ARR grew 34% year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased that our software-related metrics were at record levels in the third quarter and are tracking ahead of the targets we shared at our Investor Day in February.  Total security revenue was $160 million, growing 9% year-over-year. Security product revenue grew 16% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 6 were Cloud, 3 were service provider, and 1 was in enterprise.  Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue consistent with the third quarter of 2020. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.1%, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by favorable product and customer mix. If not for elevated supply-chain costs due to COVID-19, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.5%. Non-GAAP Operating Expense increased 8% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially, slightly below our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP Operating Margin was 16.6% for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our expectations.  We exit the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $137 million in the third quarter. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the third quarter. Now, I would like to add some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. Consistent with prior quarters in 2021, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components is impacting many industries. Caused in part by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing component shortages, which has resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs of certain products. We continue to work to resolve the effect of the supply chain challenges at an increased inventory levels and purchase commitments. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of recent disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters.  While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semi-conductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to grow 3.5%. This would be at the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We expect our fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin to decline sequentially due to higher costs related to supply constraints and product mix. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we would have forecasted non-GAAP Gross Margin of approximately 61%. We believe these elevated supply chain costs will prove to be transitory over time, but will likely remain elevated for the next several quarters.  I'd like to point out that despite an expected sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in Q4, on a full-year basis, our guidance remains approximately 59.5%, which is in line with what we provided previously.  While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty, we would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2022. Presuming no further COVID-19 related economic deterioration, based on the current order momentum we're seeing and the anticipated Q4, 2021 ending backlog, we expect at least mid-single-digit revenue growth on a full-year basis in 2022.  In addition, we expect to see at least 100 basis points of Non-GAAP Operating Margin Expansion on a full-year basis. This guidance is not dependent on improvements in lead times or easing of industry supply chain constraints.  We expect to see seasonal patterns from a revenue Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP operating expense perspective. As a reminder, our Non-GAAP gross margin tends to be sequentially lower in the first quarter with gradual volume-related improvements about the course of the year. In addition, operating expense is typically sequentially higher in the first quarter due to the reset, and variable compensation and fringe costs.  In closing I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Especially in this challenging environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We also remind everyone to limit themselves to only one question. One moment, please, while we pose for questions. And our first question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to check the number on automated WAN if that was down Year-over-year in the quarter, but then it seems like you've got a lot of opportunity as you head into next year.  And I just wanted to see what you're thinking, what happened in the quarter? Maybe you give us a little bit more color, but also was it -- was that supply mainly, and how does that look for you next year as you look out the next 12 months? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Rod. So, the short answer is, it's absolutely supply-chain limited. It just so happens that as you might imagine, for automated when the predominant product is routing, routing is when a more complex products that we need to build.  They use the most amount of the sophisticated semiconductor components. And for that reason, the discrepancy between revenue and orders is going to be greater for automated WAN and by connection also for the service provider.  Having said that, I'm very pleased with both our service provider and our automated WAN momentum, especially from a booking stand point I should mention every solution area automated WAN Cloud ready datacenter and the AI driven enterprise had order growth of over 50%.  It's just that the automated WAN had a biggest impact from when it came to supply chain challenges. I really like the fact that our newer products that we've introduced into the market line cards for the MX, line cards for the PTX are performing very well.  That's something that we monitor closely. We've talked a lot about the Metro opportunity, which in large part hasn't really positively helped us in any significant way that really, I think next year and year after it's when if kicked in. But nonetheless, we're seeing very solid early momentum with record orders for our ACX product line, which is predominantly used in that metro opportunity.  And the last thing I'll say about automated WAN which is very encouraging, is our 400-gig win rate. So, while we don't necessarily see a tone of revenue yet, with 400 gig deployments, we are looking at very solid wins and also growing orders at this point, which is reflected in the automated WAN order growth. Rod Hall : Okay. And thanks for that, Rami. And can I just -- just following that up, could you comment on the backlog, as I know you said it's a billion-dollar increase, I think year-to-date, is most of that backlog increase in this quarter in the automated WAN area where -- you're just seeing that across-the board. I'm just curious about the composition of the backlog? Rami Rahim : Yes. So, we've been building backlog throughout the year and it did grow quite healthy in Q3 as well as you noted, Rod. It is really across the board. I mean, backlog is up across all customer solutions. I would say that the automotive WAN is up a little bit more than the others, but it really is an across-the-board backlog build with a little bit more slanted towards automated WAN.  So, we are entering the fourth quarter, and I believe next year with a very healthy backlog across all products, but automated when it is, I would say, the healthiest, if you will. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, guys. Thank you very much. Rami Rahim : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Q - Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to start off by asking on pricing. What kind of actions have you taken on that front? If you can just break that down in some different verticals. Where are you finding it easier to take pricing, where it's been more difficult and in relation to the supply chain driven headwinds on gross margin when do we get to a point where you can be more net neutral with the price -- the pricing actions that you take? Another follow-up, please. Ken Miller : Yeah. So, I'll take that. Thanks for the question to me. So, we are expecting the supply-chain costs to remain elevated throughout next year. I still believe there transitory and I could be positively surprised where we might see some of that reduction, maybe late next year. But at this point, we're presuming that it's going to remain elevated on the cost side.  On the pricing side, we are absolutely taking pricing actions to try to protect our Gross Margin. At this point, I feel that we are going to be able to protect much of our Gross Margins a little too early to call exactly how that's going to play out.  The other thing I would also add is the timing. I do expect that the cost to hit us a little earlier as you can see from the results. Costs have already started to hit us and the pricing actions will take some time to feather in, particularly because we have such a large backlog at the old prices.  So, we need to burn through the backlog at kind of legacy pricing if you will. And as we make pricing actually going forward, but we will realize that benefit in 2022, but it might not be evenly throughout the year. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. As far as a follow-up, you are guiding the 5-plus in revenue growth and mid-single-digit as you call it, revenue growth in 2022. In the past, you've given some color about growth expectations by the vertical, just wanted to -- I can see different drivers, you have Cloud, you have the benefit of 400 gigs is Momentum and service provider as lenders.  If you can help us think about directionally which vertical is probably going to be your strongest growth vertical and rank order them in terms of growth for next expectations for next year? Rami Rahim : Let me take that and maybe Ken would add some more to it. First, I would say we're not really guiding to mid-single-digit or a 5% growth, as you mentioned. We're guided -- we're providing an outlook of at least mid-single-digit growth. And just keep in mind that we are supply chain limited right now. So that outlook that we provided assumes no meaningful improvement to the supply chain situation. If the supply chain situation does start to materially improve next year, then I think there is upside to that number. So, I would just start with that. In terms of where that growth comes in. Every vertical is performing extremely well, and every solution area is performing extremely well. In enterprise, I'd say it's going to be a significant growth driver for us. So, assuming against supply chain goes our way, I think the differentiation that we have in the market, the win rate, the net new wins we're getting sets us up to perform extremely well.  A service provider, I think could actually do exceptionally well and even compete with an enterprise standpoint -- with the enterprise vertical just from the standpoint of the significant backlog that we built thus far.  So, it's going to be very difficult to predict exact stack ordering of contributors to that growth, primarily because it's going to be very much determined by the supply chain situation. Ken Miller : The only thing I'll add, we'll provide more color on our next call as we typically do in the beginning of 2022. So, our Q4 call, we'll provide more color on FY '22 at that time. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you for these clarifying remarks, Rami, and thank you, Ken. Thank you. Ken Miller : Okay. Operator : And our next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Clinton : Hey guys, this is Q - Clinton for [Indiscernible] Thanks for taking our question. Maybe touching base again on the Enterprise side, we've seen some really strong quarters, especially within the [Indiscernible] business. How should we think about the puts and takes of the Enterprise strength? Is it driven more by kind of delayed projects returning or are we seeing Juniper gaining more share? Are winning more against the incumbents? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, thanks for the good question. So, I'm very confident that we're taking share in the enterprise space. You saw our enterprise routing performance, 7% year-over-year. But I think the big difference between our revenue, and I think I said enterprise routing performance, I mean enterprise revenue performance 7% Year-over-year.  Order performance is actually significantly more than that and the difference is driven primarily by the fact that we had some weakness in enterprise routing due entirely to the federal space where there's still uncertainty of our budget. So, if you remove that, our strength in the enterprise is phenomenal.  We're seeing significant wins of net new opportunities and there are two things that are driving that today. One is our AI driven enterprise solution, campus and branch that includes the Mist for wireless, wired, and WAN that's achieving new records every single quarter.  Triple-digit revenue growth for Mist, the first triple-digit bookings quarter for Mist wireless, significant EX wired switching pull-through of the Mist portfolio, all of these are contributing to that portion of the Enterprise business.  The second vector of growth within the Enterprise is a datacenter, there as well, over 50% year-over-year order growth. Significant differentiation with Apstra as the management solution for the datacenter, very solid win rate. So, I just think that we're taking share because of the strength of our portfolio which has never been this differentiated I mean, at least in my time at Juniper. Ken Miller : And I just want to add on to that a little bit. So as Rami mentioned, Enterprise from a revenue perspective was up 7%. We already talked about automated WAN and service provider being a little bit stunted because of supply. And I just want to make sure everyone is aware that all cuts, whether it's Enterprise Cloud or SP, or Automated [Indiscernible] Cloud Ready Datacenter [Indiscernible] than Price. All numbers are actually lower from a revenue perspective than we would otherwise expect if it were not for supply constraints.  We're not going to give you an absolute number, but it could have been, but in one way to look at it is the difference between our adjusted bookings on a product perspective, which is 15% or mid-teens in Q3 year-over-year as compared to our revenue growth on a product perspective of 5%.  So, it's easily to imply that there's an extra 10% of revenue growth that did not happen due to supply constraints. and that would have really lifted all boats, Enterprise, Cloud, NSP. Clinton : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James, please proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk about the general trend in your input costs and specifically what I'm pondering is the components, particularly chips that you're ordering now or ordered during the quarter, are likely to show up in 40, 50 weeks at higher price points. So, want to get a better understanding how to think about the impact of that particular headwind in 22 gross margins. Is that something you could help us with? Ken Miller : Yes. So, as you can see from -- we provided the actual reported gross margin of 60.1 this quarter, which was above midpoint due to product mix being favorable. But we also talked about what it would have been if it weren't for the elevated costs which would have been close to 61.5%.  So, these elevated costs are hitting us now. And one thing I would say, Simon, yes, we have purchase orders throughout all of next year. In some cases, out 50 weeks, in other cases, out 80 weeks, in an attempt to secure supply.  And these are non - cancelable committed purchase orders with pricing. That said, this pricing environment is taking that and throwing it out the window. We are seeing costs going up despite the fact that we have orders in place. So, we are expecting -- the orders we have in place are not necessarily the price we are going to pay. Whether it's disguised in the form of an expedite fee or purchase price variance, etc., we're seeing costs going up in advance of those orders being fulfilled if that makes sense. Simon Leopold : I think it does. Just to clarify, all else being equal your mix the same, customers the same, gross margins for products would be lower in 2022 than they are right now. Is that fair? Ken Miller : Not providing 2022 specific gross margin guidance at this point, there's just too much uncertainty. You could count on us giving you a better understanding 90 days from now on our next call.  I will say this, we're not dependent on gross margin improvement next year for us to hit our commitment of at least 100 basis points improvement in operating margin. So, we're very committed to expanding profitability next year and we're not dependent on gross margin to do that, but we are very committed to expanding profits. Simon Leopold : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. Ken Miller : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, as I listened to the call, you guys have turned out a lot of numbers. Certainly, some eye-popping stats, I think, in terms of the additional billion-dollars in backlog, triple-digit order rates across a number of your business lines and customer areas, and yet we're talking about mid-single-digit growth for next year.  Certainly, I think you caveated that at least mid-single, but I guess I'm trying to understand sort of the delta between all these numbers. I mean, it seems like at some level you expect that some of your customers have double and triple ordered with you. And I guess I'm wondering like how you see that dynamic and how does that play out going forward? Rami Rahim : Hi George. I'll start. So, I mean, you said it. We're really not guiding or we're not providing an outlook of mid-single digits. We're providing an outlook of at least that number, and we're doing it with the major assumption that supply situation does not in fact get better.  If the supply situation, in fact does start to improve, and it could by the second half of next year. Then I think you will see an upside to this outlook that we provided.  That's really the net of it. At this point in time based on visibility, we felt that it would be prudent for us to provide you with an outlook based on the supply situation not improving. However, that could be a false assumption. Things could actually be better next year. Ken Miller : Absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt that the limiting factor or the primary input into our guidance or outlook for next year is supply. This really has to do with how much supply we think we're going to have access to next year.  And that's where we came up with at least mid-single digits. If it were purely a demand equation, the number would be much greater than that. And that that holds true to nominate next year. But also, this year. George Notter : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Meta Marshall (ph.) with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : Great thanks. I'm trying to see where you were seeing the most traction with the App Store business and was its enterprise or just -- or were you seeing kind of any attraction on the hyperscale side or on the cloud side. And then maybe just a second question if you could just remind us how much of the Q3 year-on-year growth would be inorganic? Thanks Rami Rahim : Yeah. Let me start with your question about Astra. So first, I'll just say very quickly that we never anticipated that Astra would be a significant opportunity in the hyperscale space. Primarily because the top 5 hyperscale customers tend to develop their own automation software.  That being said, everything outside of hyperscale : Enterprise, service provider, even Cloud major, is an opportunity.  Where we have thus far seeing the quickest win rates, the biggest pipeline build is in the enterprise, large to mid-size enterprise companies. and as I mentioned earlier, it's extremely encouraging the rate at which we are taking down new opportunities. There is absolutely a demand for this kind of automation technology for the datacenter space. And there are some very unique aspects to our Astra software offering.  First and foremost, it's the only open solution in the market today. None of our peer automation solutions work on anything but their own switching infrastructure. Astra works on our own switching as well as sonic as well as our competitor switches. that turns out to be a highly desirable feature of the technology. Apstra is designed ground-up to scale to the largest datacenters.  That's very meaningful for large enterprises especially in financial services, and manufacturing, and other similar verticals. And Apstra invented -- pioneered the concept of intent-based networking so from an operational experience standpoint, there really is nothing as good as it in the market. So, I'm very, very pleased with the performance thus far, and I think this is going to be a great growth driver for us in the future. Ken Miller : Yes, and your second question on organic versus inorganic. When we started the year, we called out that we believe the inorganic acquisitions in aggregate, all 3 of them would add about 1% of revenue growth to Juniper.  We know it's about $50 million and that's holding exactly as we expected. So, you can take that 50 million. I am not going to give you the exact number in Q3, but if you start with a $50 million for the year and quarterize that, that gives you some indication of the inorganic revenue in Q3. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks, guys. Ken Miller : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Michael Fisher : Hey, guys. Q - Michael Fisher on for Amit. I was curious on one of the comments on the AI driven enterprise revenue growth. You mentioned both Mist and EX product families grew year-over-year. I was curious, if you can give some more color on the trajectory there and whether growth rates are accelerating, decelerating, not moving around too much for each of those products, families? Rami Rahim : Yeah, I sorry, you glitched there for a second. I think you're asking about Mist Wi - Fi, and then also the. Michael Fisher : Yes. Rami Rahim : Got it. Thank you. So first, I think by any measure, Mist has been an incredible acquisition for Juniper Networks, and it really has put our enterprise business on a significant growth and take share of trajectory. Q3 was no difference in terms of the quarter-over-quarter record we continue to make. This was a record AI - driven enterprise orders quarter and record AI - driven revenue quarter for us.  Order growth is well into double-digits and Growth in all customers verticals, SP Enterprise and Cloud providers that are all bracing the technology. And I think I did mention that it's not just about WIFI, although Wi-Fi 33 in and of itself was a record and it hit triple-digit bookings for the first time in the Q3 timeframe.  We saw a record number of EX pull-through, both in units, but also in revenue as well. So that has always been the strategy for Mist, not just about Wi-Fi 33, it's that entire client to Cloud connection that includes Wi-Fi___33, wired, and WAN. We're seeing the full benefit in wireless and wired, as we integrate 128 technology into the LAN, which is really going to happen by the end of this year. And the first part of next year, I think we'll see a similar pull-through effect happening on that side as well. So, the momentum has just been really strong. I expect that to continue for sure. Michael Fisher : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question is from David Vod with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. David Vod : Great. Hey guys. Thanks for the question. So, can I just go back to the commentary about product order growth versus actual product revenue. Are you suggesting that in 3Q there was roughly 70 million of deferred product revenue that shows up in your product backlog that you're going to recognize next year?  And if I do that same math in the June quarter, it's probably about 60 million or maybe 55 million. So, is that revenue that you think it will be recognized next year? Is that the right way to think about it? And then I have a quick follow-up. Ken Miller : Yes. So, I think those numbers you're referring to are in the ballpark from an adjusted bookings perspective, our actual backlog is growing much faster than that. We've talked about greater than a billion. So much bigger numbers.  But if you just go to our adjusted bookings number, which is that mid-teen number, that delta the revenue or the numbers you just quoted and those are the revenue that we could have or arguably should have recognized already, right, in Q3. That plus 10%, that $70 million you were referring to. That if there were not supply constraints, we would have recognized approximately that much more revenue is really the math I want you to understand. From a backlog build is much greater than that because customers are placing orders at a faster rate. David Vod : So then maybe just as a quick follow-up. So that's 70 million given your backlog, I guess would be recognized in calendar 2022. So, when I think about your commentary about at least mid-single-digit revenue growth, that sounds like about a 0.5 of that growth comes from the backlog pushed from, let's say 3Q into 4Q. What I would imagine, you're expecting something similar in Q4. Is that the right way to think about your '22 revenue outlook? There's some push-out from 3Q and 4Q that's going to benefit in 2022? Ken Miller : I do think that the backlog build, whether it's the adjusted bookings backlog build or even the unadjusted, for that matter, is going to ship essentially. So, I think that gives us confidence in our revenue outlook of at least mid-single-digit revenue growth. The reason why we're not guiding more than at least single-digits is supply constrained. So, we are supply constrained today and we're expecting to be supply constrained next year as well. So how much of that backlog and how quickly we are able to ship it is still uncertain at this point, but we feel very good about at least mid-single-digit growth due to the strength of our backlog, due to the strength of the momentum we're seeing on the bookings side, quite honestly, the execution we have in the field and depart differentiation we enjoy.  So, there's a lot of reasons to be more bullish, the one reason to be somewhat prudent is supply and that's something that's keeping us kind of at the at least mid-single digit level at this point. David Vod : Great, thanks for the color. Ken Miller : Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Bajaj Najam with MGM Partners, please proceed with your question. John Najam : Thank you for squeezing me in. I apologize I missed much of the call so if I'm repeating, I apologize. but I just want to get a better sense on your gross margin trend. In terms of -- can you give us some color on pricing environment, and how much of a percentage does that offset to a degree the component and freight costs that are impacting your near-term gross margin and how do you think the pricing environment plays out next year? I suspect it's probably favorable when -- and if anything, if I look at some of your peers like Cisco who highlight is significantly benefit in the fourth quarter for the pricing environment, I suspect you are also likely to benefit from that. So, can you give us a color on how that plays out versus component costs? Ken Miller : So, we already are seeing some of the elevated cost rates are component shortages, freight, etc. and we expect those costs to remain elevated throughout next year. In some cases, bringing up perhaps get a little worse application is actually a little better, but we expect elevated costs throughout all of next year and we're already experiencing those.  Now we've given you a Nano -meter Gross Margin reported by the Adjusted Gross Margin, just to account for that, those extra costs which we do believe are transitory. However, at this point, we're assuming it's not going to go away in 2022 it'll be beyond that. On the pricing side, we are taking actions. I think many of our competitors are taking similar actions, but will take some time for us to -- for those actions to really hit our P&L. I do expect them to be beneficial to 2022, but the timing will be a little more back-end loaded because we are carrying such a large backlog.  We have nearly $1.5 billion of backlog. We talked about growing it over a billion, we started the year with $420 million, so we're nearly at $1.5 billion. That takes some time to burn through and that's not going to be impacted by the pricing actions as much as the future of orders will be, so you'll start to see some benefit. How that all plays out is something we're -- it's just too early for us to quantify and provide outlook on. But what I am confident on is our profitability overall next year and op margin will expand by at least 100 basis points. John Najam : Can you share how the customer feedback has been on the price hikes, especially like are you getting a lot of pushback? Can you give us some color on the discounting environment, is it more discipline across the market? And should that all else being equal, if you have a favorable discounting environment, wouldn't that a good degree significantly offset the component headwinds that you've highlighted? Ken Miller : Yes. So, we are taking the pricing actions with that goal in mind to protect our gross margin, and I think to a degree at will. How much degree as what we're still working through and not willing to provide an outlook at this point? But absolutely, it should help offset and protect our gross margin, and that's why we're taking the actions. From a customer acceptance perspective, I think overall, I would summarize it is they're not surprised. They're seeing it across the board, across most of their suppliers. We're seeing it across our suppliers.  This is something that's upstream and not surprising. Obviously, I don't think that they are necessarily jumping up for joy when we talk about price increases, but I think their understanding of it. And we feel that we'll be able to capture much of that price increase and be able to protect margins to the best of our ability. David Vod : Appreciate the answer. Thank you. Ken Miller : Yeah. Operator : And our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. My question is your outlook for next year is very encouraging. I think you said at least mid-single digit. Can you just recap this year and next year the amount of organic versus inorganic, I think sometimes the timing layers in a little bit organic versus inorganic and I just assume, but maybe you can answer next year's outlook is not including anything not announced or pending or things like that for acquisitions. Thank you. Ken Miller : Yeah. Next year's outlook does not assume any new acquisitions. The acquisitions we made approximately 12 months ago are now baked in to our run rate and baked in to next year's outlook. Those businesses are growing. And so, you would see a year-on-year improvement if we were to break that out, which we're not. But we have back that into our at least mid-single-digit Growth. But this is an organic Juniper as today, outlook for next year does not require any additional M&A. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Ken Miller : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you squeezing me in all I do apologize if this has been asked and answered. First off, with respect to web-scale customers, I know 60 of your top 10 customers were Cloud and I know there has been pretty typical with presiding quarters but are all 4 of the Web Skill Johnson among those 6. Ken Miller : Are all 4 of the hyperscale\u2019s. What scale giant amongst those 6? We don't break out that love detail as you know, Paul, I mean, I think it's a fair assumption that where the Capex is where you're going to see our biggest customers. So, where the spend is likely going to be where our top 10 customers are. But I'm not going to get into any more detail and say, 6 of our top 10 are Cloud customers. Rami Rahim : I do want to add just Paul, that our Cloud provider businesses is performing incredibly well. second quarter of triple-digit order growth. And I love the broad-based strength that we're seeing. So, we're seeing an expansion within Hyperscale of opportunities and diversity across the four or five big hyperscale customers.  So, it's not just our traditionally largest Cloud provider customer that's driving that growth, is also other hyperscale customers and add to that, that Cloud major Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers that are also performing very well.  There's an additional element of strength and broad-based diversity and net is in the technology space. So, routing, switching, and security are all performing really well within the cloud provider segment. Paul Silverstein : So, Raleigh, to that statement, I assume -- I recognize, as you just pointed out, you've got more than just routing, but I assume routing is a big portion of those large -- of your business with this large Cloud operators. Where I'm really trying to go with this and I'm trying to be too clever by half clearly is in light of Facebook's massive, was the $10 billion to $15 billion increase in calendar '22 CapEx. I was trying to discern to what extent, if any, you were leveraged.  I assume you do have leverage, but I suspect you're not going to be willing to answer that. If you are, great. If not, I would like to ask you -- Let me pause and let you respond, and then I have a quick follow-up. Rami Rahim : Well, I am not going to answer a question that specific to a customer. However, I will say, I'm looking at the hot off the press earnings results from our -- the Hyperscale Cloud providers looking at their capex rates and feeling very good about that because as long as their business is performing well, they will need to invest in their infrastructure to maintain that strength, to keep up with the demand that they're seeing and we will benefit from that.  The simplest that our footprint in routing within Hyperscale is phenomenal. We've maintained that footprint despite many attempts by competitors to take slices of it away from us. And then as you get into the top 10 and Cloud major, it's not just about routing, it's about routing and switching for us. Paul Silverstein : And just a quick follow-up. I assume -- assuming that increasing number of customers are, in fact, providing longer-term forecasts, as I believe is [Indiscernible] for you and most others. I assume your forecast, your outlook for '22 is relatively more solid. There's more knowledge underlying, and let's hope relative to last year and proceeding years. Is that simply given? Ken Miller : Yeah, I think given the strength of our backlog and that's the most tangible way to look at it. I mean, we have a hard order in place for a much greater percentage of next year's revenue than we normally would entering the year. So, I think that absolutely gives us better visibility than we are accustomed to as we enter in future periods. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate the responses [Indiscernible]. Thanks, guys. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Paul. Operator : In our last question would be from Alex Henderson with Needham 40, whichever question. Alex Henderson : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the broader pricing environment. Not necessarily in context of what you're doing, but rather what you're seeing from your competitors and to what extent your actions are under an umbrella or are ahead of the umbrella and just can you talk about your price in your categories relative to what they're doing. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes. I don't want to get super specific on what others are doing individually, but I can tell you pricing actions, whether they'd be list Price actions, discount controls, or other types of actions or absolutely something that many Companies, I assume not just Juniper group, but even in other industries where they're getting input costs are rising pretty dramatically.  Many companies are exploring and implementing it. And I can tell you that so far, we have taken some actions, we'll continue to look at opportunities going forward. All in an effort to protect our gross margin. The [ inaudible 00 :55:41] costs are absolutely rising. I think that's not a secret.  It starts upstream with the wafers, and the fast, and then moves into our component suppliers, and they're seeing higher cost, and are looking to pass those on to us, and we're looking to pass those onto our customers. And so far, we feel that -- feel confident we are going to benefit from the actions we're taking, but it's just too early to commit to gross margin input -- gross margin outputs for next year. Alex Henderson : Certainly, I understand the mechanics of that. And I think everybody on the call does. There shouldn't be any surprises there. But the real question is, are you more aggressive and trying to push price or are you less aggressive versus your competition? And I don't -- I'm not asking for you to describe it on a per specific person or company.  But rather in general, are you more aggressive or less aggressive on pricing than your competition in the categories that you are competing? And particularly, can you focus a little bit on the campus market, which is particular important here, Growth steam. Rami Rahim : Yeah, Alex, let me take a stab at it. It's very difficult to answer that quantitatively because we don't know in a lot of detail what everybody else is doing. But to the extent that our peers are attempting to do what we're doing, which is essentially to offset cost increases, then I think first order of magnitude is going to be all roughly in line with each other.  And that's sort of how I would answer that question. And then in the campus and branch in particular, yes. There are going to be cost pressures there just like anywhere else. But the thing about campus and [ inaudible 00 :57:23] that makes me feel very good is, the level of differentiation.  And this is software-led differentiation has never been stronger and it allows us to win -- to compete and win on value. So, there are opportunities that we are winning now fairly routinely, where we're not price leaders, and yet we are able to garner a greater price dip because of the differentiation that we have with that solution. Alex Henderson : With all due respect, I think there are large differences between the locations where Price actions are being taken by your competitors, and necessarily your exposure to them so that there could be meaningfully differentials between categories.  And my guess is that campus is an area, that prices have gone up more rapidly, but the interest is if you have any thoughts on that point? Rami Rahim : No additional thoughts at this time. Thanks for that input, Alex. I appreciate it. Alex Henderson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rami Rahim for a closing remark. Rami Rahim : Briefly, I just wanted to thank everybody for participating in the call today and for the great questions. I will just leave you with a couple of thoughts.  First, I remain very encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in the business especially the diversity of the strength that we're seeing across market segments and technologies and solution areas. I think the team is executing extremely well and I'm very proud of our Juniper team for doing that. And last but not least, I think the demand strength we're seeing coupled with the backlog that we built right now sets us up for a great next year, both from the standpoint of achieving revenue growth, but then also our commitment to expanding profits as well. So, I'll leave you with that thought. Thanks again. Operator : And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Q4 2021 FY 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we'll open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2021 results. I hope you and your families are well, and my thoughts go out to all those who continue to be affected by the global pandemic. We delivered strong results during the fourth quarter, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share both exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, despite continued challenges from a supply chain perspective. Demand remained strong and exceeded our expectations with orders seeing high teens year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead times. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a third consecutive quarter, and our ending backlog increased to a record level of more than $1.8 billion. Order momentum was strong across all verticals, all customer solutions and all geographies with each of these categories experiencing strong double-digit order growth year-over-year. Our Q4 results capped a very strong 2021, which saw us grow our Enterprise business for a fifth consecutive year, grow our Cloud business for a third consecutive year and return our Service Provider business to growth. Not to be overlooked, we also expanded our non-GAAP operating margin year-over-year, despite absorbing material increases in both supply chain and acquisition-related costs. Our teams are executing extremely well, and we are entering the new year with strong momentum. This momentum is being driven by our strategic actions, and there are four pillars that give me confidence as we look forward to 2022. First, our commitment to experience first networking and delivering technologies that simplify customer operations and improve the end user experience. While our experienced first journey started with Mist and then 128 Technology in our AI-Driven Enterprise portfolio, we subsequently extended this vision to the data center with the Apstra acquisition and the service provider market with our Paragon Automation suite. These software-centric solutions give us important strategic control point that not only create new recurring revenue opportunities, but also differentiate and pull through other Juniper products, creating a multiplier effect that will benefit growth in the years to come. Our experience-first vision is a key point of differentiation for our product that we believe is resonating across customers and providing confidence in our future prospects. Second, we are highly focused and aligned to three major use cases, Automated WAN, AI-Driven Enterprise and Cloud-Ready Data Center solutions, and we are enabling security to be seamlessly embedded within all of them. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years, focusing our company from a product management to engineering to go-to-market on a handful of meaningful and growing opportunities, enabled us to accelerate our growth in 2021. This focus also enables us to continue to deliver the technical differentiation and new innovations to capitalize on the big market inflection that we see unfolding in 2022 and beyond. Third, our go-to-market transformation is yielding meaningful results. This started with a change in sales leadership back in early 2019, which was followed by a meaningful increase in quota-carrying sales reps during 2020 and incremental sales development and enablement capabilities in 2021. We have also made meaningful investments in our channel, increasing the total number of Juniper channel partners by more than 30% since 2019. This investment not only resulted in record channel sales this past quarter, but also more than 100% increase in year-over-year deal registration, which reflects robust demand generated solely by channel. These investments in our sales and channel organizations have enabled us to accelerate our growth and should position us to do so again in the upcoming year. To be clear, we view our go-to-market organization as a competitive advantage where we will continue to invest to capture share. Finally, we continue to transition our business to a more software-centric model. This includes transforming more of our perpetual offerings to term-based licenses, introducing more ratable subscription offerings and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack. While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced encouraging momentum in the Q4 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grow 41% year-over-year and orders increased by more than 100% year-over-year. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 32% year-over-year due to strong demand for Mist and certain security subscriptions. We are encouraged by the progress we're making in our efforts to capture more software revenue, which we view as critical to not only accelerating growth, but also improving customer stickiness and margin. Our strategy is well- aligned against a backdrop of healthy end markets that should position us for growth over the next few years. This growth is being driven by the strategic importance of the network, which is only likely to increase in the coming years as enterprise, digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate Cloud and Service Provider 400-gig upgrade, build momentum and Service Provider 5G investments expand beyond the radio access layer to the Metro, Edge and Core portions of the network. While I'm encouraged by the market dynamics we're seeing, I strongly believe the products we are delivering, the customer engagement we've developed and the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization will position us to gain share and deliver sustainable growth in the years to come, regardless of end market conditions. As you can tell, I am very optimistic regarding our future projects, despite the supply chain challenges we're continuing to navigate. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory, and the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver solid growth and improved profitability in 2022 and beyond. Based on our recent order momentum, current backlog levels and our assumptions regarding supply, we currently expect to deliver 7% to 9% sales growth and at least a point of operating margin expansion in 2022. Our expectations for 2022 assume current supply chain challenges persist and that we are unable to work down backlog during the year, potentially creating longer-term tailwinds for our business once the supply chain improves and backlog returns to more normal levels. While we would expect gross orders to decline in 2022 as lead times stabilize and we start seeing fewer early orders, we expect adjusted orders to grow for the year. Now, I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our Automated WAN Solutions, which saw strong momentum from both a revenue and order perspective, particularly with our Cloud and Service Provider customers. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and strong adoption of our newer products, as well as our Paragon Automation portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well, and we now have more than 200 wide area wins that should present building tailwinds from a revenue perspective in the years to come. We are continuing to invest in our Automated WAN portfolio, and just recently announced next-gen custom silicon families for our MX and PTX platform that will offer industry-leading throughput, power efficiency and logical scale, all while maintaining investment protection. We are also continuing to invest in our ACX Metro portfolio, where we continue to see strong early interest that should further build as we complete the portfolio later this year. These investments are resonating with our Service Provider and Cloud customers, who appreciate that no single silicon family is optimized for all use cases and prefer to purchase systems with silicon that is purpose built for the job at hand. We are playing to win across all areas of automated LAN solutions and making the investments needed to capitalize on our customers' Core, Edge and Metro requirements that we believe present opportunities for growth over the next several years. Our AI-Driven Enterprise revenue significantly outpaced the market, growing 29% year-over-year in Q4 and 27% on a full year basis. It has been especially exciting to see our Mist solution go from a cool technology to a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless access, with top scores in both vision and ability to execute, buoyed by several unique architectural differences, including leading AIOps and a modern microservices cloud, we continue to see record numbers in our wired and wireless access business. For example, our wireless revenue more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, and the winning continues as we recently closed a multimillion dollar win with a major multinational bank based on simplified operations via AIOps and location services that leverage our patented virtual BLE technology. We're also seeing strong Mist pull-through of our EX switching portfolio, which experienced record orders and units sold in the fourth quarter. Our Mistified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through more than doubled in Q4 as compared to last year and our annualized order run rate surpassed $600 million in the quarter. On a full-year basis, our Mistified revenue was approximately $300 million in 2021 and nearly doubled year-over-year. Our AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which combines the unique Session Smart Routing technology acquired by 128 Technology, with the automation and inside of Mist AI is following in the same footsteps. We saw triple-digit year-over-year revenue and order growth in Q4, with key wins in various sectors like retail and banking and strong traction within the federal government. One new customer deployed 300 sites the week before Christmas, highlighting the ease and scale of the Juniper SD-WAN solution driven by Mist AI. With new product enhancements announced this month, including day 0 and 1 operation via the Mist Cloud, new SSR hardware platform and bundled security capabilities, we expect demand to further build in future quarters. Of special note are the full stack, multimillion dollar opportunities we continue to win and deploy where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access and WAN Edge needs. Based on our recent order momentum, third-party validation and the technical superiority of our AI-Driven Enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook for our AI-Driven Enterprise business during the upcoming year. While our Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue declined in Q4 due solely to the timing of shipments related to supply chain challenges, we experienced another quarter of encouraging order trend, driven by broad-based strength across verticals and geographies. We continue to see strong momentum with new logos, and we secured a record number of deals greater than $1 million. 400-gig momentum remains strong. We now have more than 60 400-gig data center wins that include cloud majors, large enterprise and service provider accounts. Key to our continued growth in the data center is Apstra, the industry's leading intent-based networking solution that provides users with a superior experience versus our competitors across day 0, day 1 and day 2 operation. Apstra remains the only open-fabric management platform on the market, which is not only creating software-only management opportunities, but also driving full stack data center win. We're investing in sales enablement and the tools needed to accelerate our Apstra-driven success during the upcoming year. Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high, and we continue to be optimistic about the growth prospects for this business in the upcoming year. Our security revenue was essentially flat in Q4, but orders saw double-digit year-over-year growth. We remain confident in our connected security strategy, and believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another impressive quarter, and our services business continues to grow year-over-year due to record renewals and strong attach rate. Our customer satisfaction scores once again set new all-time highs, and our service margins came in better than expected due to higher revenue and lower costs. On a full year basis, our service margins achieved a new all-time record of 65.8%, up 170 basis points as compared to the prior year. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud-delivered insights to not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and customer experience. Before I conclude, I\u2019d like to state that our mission at Juniper is to power connections and empower change. Now, more than ever, we are committed to ensuring networking is a force for good in this world, that includes building global resilience to combat climate risk throughout our business and supply chain and enabling solutions for a low-carbon future. We continue to make, monitor and report our environmental, social and governance progress through our annual corporate social responsibility report and CDP responses. Today, we are responding to the need for urgent and bold action. We are committing our global facility to be carbon neutral by 2025. You can follow our progress on our new climate web page, juniper.net/climate. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2021 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2021 at $1,300 million of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56, both above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 9%, sequentially, exceeding our expectations despite the challenging supply chain environment. These strong results were driven by solid execution by our global team. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see significant order growth across all verticals, geographies and customer solutions. Gross orders saw a third consecutive quarter of greater than 50% year-over-year growth. Some of this order strength was attributable to ongoing industry supply chain challenges, causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total part orders are estimated to have grown in the high teens year-over-year. Due to the strength in orders and the continued constraints related to component supply, we ended the year with record backlog of more than $1.8 billion. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Cloud grew 19%, Service Provider grew 8% and Enterprise decreased 3%. While Enterprise revenue declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, Enterprise orders posted strong double-digit year-over-year growth and exceeded our expectations. Turning to customer solutions. On a year-over-year basis, AI-Driven Enterprise grew 29%, Automated WAN Solutions grew 8% and Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue declined 9%. This decline was entirely due to timing of shipments as Cloud-Ready Data Center orders experienced strong double-digit order growth year-over-year. Total software and related services revenue was $242 million, an increase of 41% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year, and we exited the year with $206 million in ARR. This strength reflects our efforts to transform to a more software-centric business. Total Security revenue was $162 million, flat year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, but product orders posted strong growth year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of total revenue as compared to 30% in the fourth quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.5% in the fourth quarter, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by a favorable product and software mix. If not for elevated COVID-19-related costs, we anticipate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were due to a onetime $5 million expense related to the postponement of our sales kickoff event as a result of the recent surge of COVID-19 cases. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $116 million for the quarter. We paid $64 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $148 million worth of shares in the quarter. Moving on to full year results. Total revenue for 2021 was $4,735 million, which was up 7% versus 2020. Despite the pandemic and supply chain constraints, we saw growth across all of our verticals, customer solutions and geographies. Our Cloud business grew 14%, while Service Provider and Enterprise both grew 4% compared to last year. From a customer solution perspective, AI-Driven Enterprise increased 27%, Cloud-Ready Data Center grew 7% and Automated WAN Solutions grew 3% on a full year basis. The top line strength we experienced across verticals and customer solutions is driven by the technology investments we have made, as well as our focus on transforming our go-to-market organization. Total software and related services revenue was $761 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. Total Security revenue was $657 million, which grew 8% year-over-year. Security Product revenue was up 14% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total 2021 revenue as compared to 30% in 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by service gross margin expansion. If not for elevated COVID-19-related supply costs, we estimate we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61% in 2021. 2021 operating expenses increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to higher variable compensation and the costs associated with the acquisitions of Netrounds, 128 Technology and Apstra. Despite these increased costs, operating margin increased to 15.9%, an improvement of 40 basis points versus last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.74, an increase of 12% compared to 2020. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $690 million, an increase of $78 million compared to 2020. We repurchased $433 million worth of shares and paid $259 million in dividends for a total capital return of 117% of free cash flow to shareholders during 2021. I'm very pleased with our financial performance, both in the fourth quarter and 2021. The performance is a testament to our team's dedication and resiliency through these challenging and dynamic times. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We expect first quarter revenue of $1,150 million, plus or minus $50 million, which is growth of 7% year-over-year. We are still experiencing significant supply chain-related headwinds associated with rising component and elevated freight costs, which are expected to continue at least through the first half of the year. While we have taken pricing actions to offset these headwinds, we do not expect these actions to have an impact until later in the year. Therefore, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 58%, plus or minus 1%, a sequential decrease. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.31, plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 332 million. Turning to our expectations for the full year of 2022. Given the strong order momentum we are experiencing and our exiting backlog, we are updating our revenue growth expectations for 2022 from at least mid-single-digits to 7% to 9% growth. This guidance assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year, similar to current levels and does not further deteriorate. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially throughout the course of the year. We expect supply chain constraints to be particularly tight during the first half and remain challenged throughout the remainder of the year. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels and largely unchanged throughout the year. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of 58% to 60%, which is a slight decline from 2021 levels. We expect gross margin for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of the range due to the elevated cost of components and logistics. I'd like to mention that we see potential for non-GAAP gross margins to trend to the high end of the range in the second half of the year as volume increases and the pricing actions we have taken flow through to the results. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand by at least 100 basis points versus 2021. That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities, and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis, consistent with the guidance we provided during our third quarter 2021 earnings announcement. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. And our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow faster than revenue on a full year basis. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Tim Long from Barclays. Tim Long : Thank you. I did want to follow up on the orders here. Rami, if you could just talk a little bit about still over 50%, but a little down from the prior quarter. So, can you talked a little bit about what you're hearing from customers? Are they not buying out as -- ordering out as far as they were previously? And how do you see -- do you see new orders to be volatile and correct? But how do you see kind of shipments for a lot of some of these larger companies as you go forward? And then second, for the follow-up, just touch on the Service Provider business, which seems to have turned around pretty nicely this year. It seems like most are expecting a pretty solid in the next few years there as well. So, can you just touch on your outlook there and particularly as you push more into the Metro Edge? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly. Thanks for the questions, Tim. So, I'll start with the first one around order momentum. And I'll just say that orders have been strong for the last year, the last three quarters over 50% year-over-year growth in orders. And they remain strong now. Our order momentum, what we're seeing in the market, the opportunity out there is very solid, very encouraging and it's true across all of our key strategic vertical market segments, Cloud, SP and Enterprise. So, I'd love to be able to say that we're going to continue to see over 50% year-over-year growth on a continuous basis forever. I mean, that's unrealistic. We have been clear that there is a certain amount of early ordering that happened over the last year. And that will eventually -- we don't know exactly when, but will eventually start to gradually decline. But that said, on an adjusted basis, our organic order, the true reflection of the health of the business will grow this year, and that's because of the strong demand environment, in addition I think to the great differentiation that we enjoy in our solutions. On the SP side of the house, I'm very pleased with the performance that we're seeing in our business. Orders grew well into double-digit territory in the Q4 time frame. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Orders for a full year basis was also very solid. We're exiting 2021 with record backlog in this area as well. The strength has to do with the broad-based nature of our go-to-market focus. So, it's not just Tier 1 carriers here in North America where we are actually seeing some encouraging momentum, but also Tier 2, Tier 3, cable and international accounts. 400-gig, which we've talked about a lot as an opportunity, it doesn't only apply to the cloud provider space. There are some significant opportunities out in the Service Provider space, especially in the core segment, and we are winning good amounts of those opportunities right now. And I think that will bode well for us in terms of tailwinds for revenue in the future. And last but not least, you touched on Metro. If you think about the part of the network that will benefit the most from 5G RAN deployments that are happening today, it will be the Metro, which is why we've made a strategic decision to invest in this space. And we don't yet have the complete portfolio, but we have certainly seen encouraging signs that we're on to something and something significant. And just as a data point, I'd tell you that our Metro-focused aggregation switch, which is the ACX family of products, now hit, for the first time, $100 million in bookings run rate in Q4. And that's solution, which I anticipate we will have by the end of this year. So that's a very encouraging data point that suggests that we should see some good tailwinds from the Metro opportunity later this year and especially next year. Operator : The next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. George Notter : I guess, I wanted to ask about your pricing increases. I heard what you said in terms of the timing of those coming in later in the year. But can you just talk about customer receptivity? I would imagine that some of your Enterprise customers are a bit easier in terms of taking pricing, but maybe more of a negotiation on Service Provider and Cloud. Can you just kind of walk through like what you're seeing there? Ken Miller : Yes. Thanks, George. I think, I mean, you\u2019re -- what you're imagining is largely playing out. I mean, we did do the pricing increases last year that we referred to. I would say customers aren't happy about price increases. I think that's an obvious statement. But they are understanding, right? And for the vast majority of the cases, we are able to implement the pricing actions as we expected to. So feel good about what we've done, feel good about the market reception overall. And it should pay off for us as that starts to go through the top line, which we anticipate more of that rolling in the second half of this year. George Notter : Got it. And then, the Service Provider and Cloud Provider pricing negotiations, so I guess, to underline this, they are taking higher pricing from you guys. Is that fair? Ken Miller : Yes, it is fair. I mean, we are doing it deal by deal and sometimes customer-by-customer situations, but we are seeing acceptance across the board. George Notter : And then anything you can tell us about -- if I remember correctly, you guys raised pricing initially back in Q2 of last year or maybe towards the tail end of Q2 last year. Should those pricing increases be benefiting you earlier this year? Ken Miller : Yes. So, we did an action in the first half of last year around June. There was a partial action, if you will. It didn't impact all of our products. The action we took in Q4 was more expansive and impacted all of our hardware products. So, we did take two actions. We are seeing some of the realization from the first action, but the second action was, I think, would be more impactful for us. Operator : The next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I want to see if maybe you could unpack the cloud vertical a little bit more in terms of maybe some color on the behaviors of what you guys have termed the cloud majors as opposed to the hyperscalers. Just give us some sense of what the contributions are like and if there are differences in their trends. And just as an easy follow-up, within the forecast of 7% to 9% sales growth, how much of that are you assuming is coming from the price increases? Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Simon. Let me start on the question around the cloud, and then I'll hand it over to Ken to talk about the contribution of price increases to our revenue growth this year. So, I'm delighted with the momentum we continue to see in our cloud vertical. I think the thing that I like the most about what we're seeing in this area is the diversity of the success that we're seeing, not just within the hyperscalers and the cloud majors or between those two, within each of those categories. So in hyperscalers, we traditionally, as you all know, had a very large customer that generated a lot of the growth over the last several years. It's now really much more distributed across a number of significant hyperscale accounts. And I think that speaks to the strength of our footprint, the strength of our technology and the engagements, the solid engagement that we have with the hyperscale accounts. We have, in addition to hyperscale, been very much focused on broadening within the Tier 2 cloud provider space or what we call the cloud major space, and we've made really great progress. The good news is, much of the technology that we develop for hyperscale applies very much to cloud majors, including a lot of the 400-gig wide area networking and data center investments. But in addition to that, our automation portfolio, so the Apstra technology that makes the act of developing or deploying and running a data center very simple now actually has strong applicability to our cloud majors segment. So, it really is strength across the board, and I'm delighted to see the momentum that we have here. Ken Miller : Yes. And on the pricing action, we have considered that when we provided the guidance of 7% to 9% growth this year. And we haven't quantified exactly how much it is. But just to let you know, the majority -- the reason why we did the pricing action was really to offset as much of the price increases as we can. So, it's really more about protecting margin and trying to offset some of those margin headwinds. It will result in some revenue growth, obviously, and is factored into the overall guide. Operator : The next question is coming from Tal Liani from BoA. Tal Liani : I have just one quick follow-up question before I ask my other question. The F5, when they reported, they said that there was a further deterioration in the last 30 days of the quarter when it comes to getting specialized networking gear like FPGAs and CPUs and others. Do you see the same deterioration in the ability to source supplies components, or do you see same environment today as it was before? Ken Miller : Yes. We haven't seen anything notable in the last 30 days. I would say we've seen pretty constant supply constraints for the last few quarters, right? So we have seen, I'm not going to say it's a good environment. It still remains constrained, but we haven't seen anything noticeable in the last 30 days. We expect lead times to remain extended we expect the cost obviously is definitely going out on the cost of components, et cetera. The one thing I would point out, although we comment that it's going to be remain contained for the year, particularly in the first half, we do believe we have line of sight to absolute volume increases year-over-year, right? I mean, we're guiding to a full year growth of 7% to 9% revenue growth. So, at this point in time, even with the constrained environment, and we're not getting as much supplies as we would like to get, we do believe we're getting enough to satisfy that revenue outlook. Tal Liani : Got it. I want to ask you about market share, specifically in routing. So, the environment is getting better. You spoke about new products in certain areas. Can you talk about, maybe break it down, your expectations, areas where you expect to gain share in routing and areas where you don't expect market share like unique market rate dynamics. And I'm referring to end markets, like Cloud, Enterprise, Service Providers, Cloud, et cetera. Rami Rahim : Right. I want to make sure I understand the question. Are you referring to the Service Provider segment specifically and then sort of different layers or opportunities within the Service Provider space? Are you really talking about Service Provider, Cloud and Enterprise as three separate segments? Tal Liani : We can take it anywhere. I'm trying to take the routing market after being down -- sort of flat to down for so many years, and I understand there's going to be a cycle now. I'm trying to break it down. And I'm trying to understand what are the areas -- and you can take it anywhere you want. What are the areas where you expect growth and expect share gains, and what are the areas where you believe that the market dynamics will remain kind of the same as before? Rami Rahim : Got it. Got it. Okay. And specifically to routing. So, in routing, whenever you're talking about routing, you should really be focusing on two market opportunities in particular, and that's Cloud and SP. There is obviously also routing that goes into the Enterprise space, but I think our key focus is on Cloud and SP. The big inflection point that's happening right now in both of these segments is around 400-gig. And that is an opportunity for us to take share in that area. But in addition to that, specific to the SP is the Metro opportunity. So, let's talk about 400-gig. I want to be very clear. I am very confident, based on order momentum, right? Not yet seen in revenue because it's still early days in terms of shipping and deployments and building out these networks, but in terms of actual order momentum, where we've seen well over 50% growth for the last three quarters, we're taking share. I am very confident we're taking share. And now add to that in the SP space, the Metro, where there is no way but up for us because it's essentially a brand-new market opportunity for us. It's the fastest-growing subsegment of the routing opportunity within the SP space because that's where most of the 5G traffic needs to flow through. That is another area where I'm very confident we will take share, especially as that portfolio comes together throughout this year. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Paul Silverstein : Yes. To begin with, I've got a broader question with respect to share gain versus market growth. And I appreciate it's hard to delineate, if not impossible. But the strength you've been referencing across every aspect of your business, Rami, Ken, how much of that do you attribute to a confluence of very strong trends with networking in virtually all of your customer markets, albeit of a different nature? And how much of that is the fact that in a number of cases, such as with Mist for wireless LAN, as well as the pull-through impact on other products? How much of it is a function of share gain? Any insight you can offer there before I have my follow-up? Rami Rahim : So Paul, I think you touched on the one area, the AI-Driven Enterprise and Mist within that area, where I believe our competitive differentiation has never in the history of this company been this strong. And the order growth rates have been phenomenal. Even in revenue for the Q4 time frame, we posted strong revenue results. And for the full year, we've shown strong revenue results, even in the face of very difficult supply chain challenges that we have had to overcome. There is a couple of key reasons for this. One is the strength of the technology, and we're sitting on some true underlying architectural differences in how we have built these solutions using a scale-out cloud native architecture that can scale to the largest enterprises in the world, exceptional leadership and really solid sales execution because we've invested in our sales, in our channel and our enablement team. So, again, very confident that we are taking share. And I honestly think that that share taking can accelerate as more of those orders that we posted translate to actual revenue and we start to draw down the huge backlog that we built. Paul Silverstein : Rami, on the enterprise piece, given your comments, risk of different details, but similar in terms of the strength they're seeing and then Cisco being the largest -- obviously, largest incumbent, they are not -- they have been very bullish about their business as well. As I parse on this as we look out longer term beyond 2022, well beyond 2022, there's a lot of what's going on in enterprise from a market standpoint. Does this go back to when there was an incredibly pregnant pause that lasted for years, as many enterprises were not sure, were evaluating what to do with respect to cloud. How many applications to keep on-prem? How much to move to public clouds, et cetera? And that cause a really pregnant pause in the enterprise decision-making with respect to network architecture, network deployment decisions. Are we now seeing the -- is the industry seeing -- or are you and peers seeing the reverberation that that pause is passed and now there's this multiyear investment cycle as enterprise catch up above and beyond the share gains that you've been referencing? Rami Rahim : Yes. It's a great question. First, I'll say -- I'll sort of break it up into two time lines. Over the last couple of years, there were certainly segments or elements of the Enterprise that were actually affected. They experienced headwinds as a result of COVID. But we did a really nice job of pivoting to subsegments that, not only were not affected, but in some cases, had to invest more. So take big box retailers, college campuses, public sector. I think those subsegments experienced an increase in the need to look at networking more strategically, and we captured that opportunity with really differentiated solutions. Now, let's look forward. And as things start to normalize, albeit, of course, very gradually, I don't think that enterprises and CIOs and CTOs of those enterprises are going to be rushing towards the legacy on-prem complexity of the past. They are looking for cloud-delivered, AI-driven solutions for the enterprise. They are also looking for simple data center operations. And I think, honestly, we are best equipped to capture those inflection points. So, yes, I view that the tailwinds in the Enterprise will only increase going forward relative to what we've experienced in the last couple of years. I'm talking about the market tailwinds here. Operator : The next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler. James Fish : Look, great quarter. I'm not going to try to pick on something, but the one part we could is data center and security a little bit with security being roughly a quarter of that data center product business. The security space hasn't been this strong in terms of the spending environment since arguably 2015. And I get orders are growing very nicely. But why is this business as well as the switching side within that data center business really not growing faster? Is it just prioritizing the other segments given higher cloud and service provider mix? And is there any way to break out what you would have grown in these segments this quarter, excluding the supply chain issues versus do we have a demand issue for Juniper security specifically? Rami Rahim : Okay. So, I think the question, if I understood, James, is both about around data center switching and sort of more broadly security. And let me first address the easier part of your question, which is the second part. Everything would have grown if it weren't for supply chain constraints. Literally everything. Because we are currently supply chain constraint in terms of what we're able to ship and, of course, that ties to our revenue. Our data center switching business is performing very well. Throughout all of last year, we have grown orders well into double-digit territory. Our revenue grew for the full year last year as well. Our revenue declined in the Cloud-Ready Data Center in Q4, purely because of the timing of orders relative to the availability of specific parts in this somewhat crazy world we live in from a supply chain standpoint. So honestly, I don't -- I'm not concerned at all about demand or about the solutions that we have available to capture those demands and to compete with our peers in the industry. On the security side, there again, I think look at our security from two standpoints. There's sort of a more mainstream, broad-based security that attaches to our enterprise offerings. That actually grew very nicely. There is also a larger high-performance security segment, which is really characterized with these very large high-performance products, our high-end SRX product line that are just lumpy. They're going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. And you're going to -- you saw some of that in the Q4 time frame. But again, the true reflection, I think, of the health of our security business is in product orders, and that grew well into double-digit territory. Ken Miller : Yes. The only thing I would add on the security front is if you take the full year view in our product business, security business grew 14%. So, you are seeing this kind of an anomaly in any given 90-day period with the Q4 results. We're pretty pleased with the overall security performance throughout the course of the year. Operator : The next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex Henderson : First off, I want to compliment you on the way you've handled the duration question versus new gross orders. It's a lot clearer than most other companies are handling it. And it's obviously very nice to see that acceleration from roughly 15% adjusted growth to high teens. What I -- my question though is on the increase in the guidance for the full year. Given you have already baked in the price hikes that you did last year, there's nothing changed on that front. And given the commentary around the supply chain hasn't changed at all, so you've been -- very nice order growth, but you're still supply constrained. So, I guess, the question is what allows you to take your growth rate and revenues up from mid-singles to 7% to 9% if there's no improvement in availability? Is it a function of software, having much higher growth and a shift towards software growth being higher? Is it a function of a mix shift within what you're expecting? Is it a function of redesign? What allowed you to take the revenues up by a couple, 2%, 3% with no change in outlook for supply chain improvements? Ken Miller : Yes. No, thanks for the question. So, our 2022 revenue guide of 7% to 9% is absolutely constrained by supply. If we could access more supply, the guidance would likely be much higher, given the demand strength that we've seen, given the backlog that we\u2019ve built out. So, it is a supply-constrained forecast, if you will. Now, what we said -- nothing's changed and that we still believe the supply chain is going to remain challenged. That said, our confidence in our line of sight to procuring the supply that we need for the year has changed a bit, right? So we were talking about at least mid-single digits. We just had a little more volatility in our assumptions 90 days ago. Now that we're 90 days forward, we feel better about saying 7% to 9%. So, we did raise it from at least mid-single to 7% to 9% basically on our confidence level and our ability to procure supply we need to deliver that revenue goal. Operator : The next question is coming from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Thank you. First, I just wanted to double-click on something you said earlier, Rami, and you've alluded to this twice on this conference call, which is the Metro opportunity and solution set. Can you just expand on all of this? Like, what is required? What are telcos, cables, other SPs, what are they going to need for this? What are you guys specifically looking to add to portfolio and just so we can better understand why this isn't actually in position yet and where it's really going? So that's the first piece. The second piece is on Apstra. And maybe you could just tell us -- I think you mentioned earlier that some of your cloud customers are actually using this. But maybe you could expand if this could actually be much more all encompassing for all your customers to potentially use. Could you just kind of help us understand these two things? Rami Rahim : Absolutely. Thanks for the really good questions, Sami. So, on the Metro opportunity, and the question specifically is what do we need? So, we have great routing technology. We have a fantastic routing stack, our Junos and Junos Evolved operating systems, are all really critical ingredients. What we need are price and form factor optimized systems to capture the end-to-end Metro opportunity because in metro, you're putting or deploying platforms and sort of the outer reaches of the Internet closer and closer to residential customers and business customers and so on. So you can think about it from a technology development standpoint, it's relatively low-hanging fruit. We have a lot of the most complex pieces. We just have to optimize it in terms of power form factor for that specific opportunity. And that's exactly what we're doing. Why didn't we do it earlier? Simply because we had priorities of investment elsewhere, and now we are making this as a bet. And we're essentially lining that bet with the emergence of the 5G opportunity. And I should also just mention that very importantly in the Metro, there is a software component, a management and day two operations components that we're becoming really good at based on the experience that we've built with Mist in the AI-Driven Enterprise, and more recently, Apstra in the data center. Okay. With -- that leads us to then the second question with Apstra. Apstra today is primarily focused. The bulk of the business and deployment that we have on the data center, not 100%. We do have some campus and other opportunities. But really, it's the data center is the primary opportunity. Apstra is the only open-management solution for the data center in the industry. It's the best from an operational experience standpoint. They wrote the book on intent-based networking, and it's the higher scale. It scales to the largest customers in the world. And that's the differentiation that's allowing us to win more and more full stack data center opportunities or just pure software opportunities. Eventually, we might look at expanding the reach of Apstra beyond the data center. But right now, quite frankly, I'm much more focused on the data center opportunity. We've got formidable competitors in this space and we want to make sure that we continue to deliver the best possible solutions for our customers. Operator : The next question is coming from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is Max Sanfer [ph] on for Rod. Thank for taking my question. I had a question -- more specific question on the supply constraints, and we're wondering how tight to higher-speed MX router lines supply currently is? And is it worse or better than the previous quarter? And maybe you can even comment which of the -- chips are in shorter supply. Ken Miller : Yes. So supply constraints are really across the board, and you are seeing ebbs and flows as we solve a particular problem, maybe another problem pops up. As it relates to MX specifically, you could see from the revenue results anyway, Q3 was actually down overall in kind of our SP business and Q4 was up. So we did ship more in Q4 than we did in, say, Q3. But that's going to vary quarter-to-quarter based on timing of orders, but more importantly, timing of supply. So I don't feel there's a unique supply constraint or situation with our MX line cards. It really is kind of across the board, across all of our products and solutions. Operator : The next question coming from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : I just had a question on the operating margin expansion. Does -- some of the companies that we talked to indicated that there's rising compensation costs for '22 to retain employees. Is that baked into your guidance for the at least 100 basis points of expansion? Ken Miller : Yes. So, we have factored in our total operating cost expectations for 2022, not only for investment purposes, but also retaining employees. So yes, that is factored into our fall plans, including our expansion plans to expand operating margin. Operator : The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Michael Fisher : This is Michael Fisher on for Amit. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious that you mentioned gross margins would have been 61.7%, I think, without COVID-related cost, so about 220 basis-point delta versus what you reported. I'm wondering, is there any way to kind of break down that 220 basis points between input cost inflation versus other factors like freight or anything else that's having an impact? Ken Miller : Yes. So, I'll tell you that both, freight is a big chunk of it, as well as just component costs and expedite fees. So I would categorize component costs and expedite fees is kind of the same bucket. If you look at that as a combined group versus freight, both are effectively equally impactful to that number. Operator : The next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Erik Lapinski : This is Erik on for Meta. I guess, just when we look at the strength in Automated WAN, if we can go back to that, was any of that driven by new web-scale customer projects you've noted, or is that mostly from existing customers? And I guess, if a new customer, would there be any project-based volatility that we should be mindful of? Rami Rahim : Yes. It's actually a great question. I think a lot of the strength and the momentum that we've seen over the last year has actually been more driven by existing footprint, existing deployments that we have within both our service provider and our cloud customers. But having said that, we have been competing for and winning new 400-gig opportunities in both segments. And we alluded, I think, starting a couple of quarters ago, to a fairly large hyperscale cloud provider WAN, in other words, routing win. Those opportunities might have contributed to some extent to our orders and to our backlog but not yet to revenue. So, the quick summary is most of the strength and the momentum thus far has been existing footprint, but great win that will continue to give us tailwinds throughout this year and next year as those opportunities start to actually deploy. Operator : The next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you. Following up on that topic, I actually was going to ask directly about that. I remember a few quarters ago, Rami, you were very excited about some hyperscaler lab work and design wins and such. And I was going to ask you about the time line of that. Is it typically like a 12-month and then we start to see revenue recognition? Is it longer? Does COVID kind of play into some of those hyperscale, what I would consider new greenfield customer and relationships? I'm just trying to calibrate expectations for when we start to fold that into your revenue model. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes. I think it's fair to think of this as deployment will happen throughout this year, probably more in the second half of the year. Typically, the sequence of events is there's a testing period as part of an RFP process. There is winning the opportunity and then there's a certification period where you work closely with the customer to do use case-specific testing and getting it ready for early feed trials and then ultimately into deployment. So, maybe sort of second half of this year time frame. And that's typically true of most large-scale WAN wins, whether they be in the cloud provider space or the service provider space. Operator : Okay. I'd now like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Well, listen, I just wanted to thank everybody. I appreciate the time and the interest, as well as the confidence that you placed in our -- in myself and in my management team. I hope you can see the confidence that we have in our prospects, both in terms of our ability to deliver revenue growth as well as profitability, and not just for this year but on a sustainable basis. So, thank you. And we'll talk soon. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we\u2019ll open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss our Q1 2022 results. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to provide a brief statement on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. My thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic war, particularly our colleagues in the region and those with loved ones who have been impacted. When the war began, we quickly suspended all sales and services within Russia and Belarus. Given the complexity of the events, we\u2019re continuing to closely monitor the situation and hope for the restoration of peace and safety. In the meantime, Juniper and its employees made contributions to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, and the Juniper Foundation made a donation to UNICEF to help its vital work in the region.  Turning to the quarter, we delivered strong Q1 results. Revenue growth accelerated year-over-year, and we met the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, despite continued challenges from a supply chain perspective. Our teams continue to execute extremely well and are focused on delivering solutions that simplify the life of network operators and delight network users, what we call experience first networking, continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is evidenced in our Q1 results, which not only benefited from a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in cloud, but also an exceptional performance by our enterprise business, which saw revenue grow nearly 20% year-over-year. This enterprise performance is particularly noteworthy, as it was the first quarter in Juniper\u2019s history to enterprise what\u2019s the company\u2019s largest customer vertical. Cloud and enterprise strength more than offset a modest decline in our service provider vertical, which was due entirely to the timing of shipments as a result of supply chain challenges.  Demand remained strong in the March quarter, with orders estimated to have seen double-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for certain large customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for extended lead times. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 35% year-over-year, and our ending backlog increased meaningfully on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Order momentum was strong across all customer verticals and all customer solutions, with each of these categories experiencing strong double-digit order growth year-over-year.  While some of the strength reflect healthy customer spending patterns across each of our core customer verticals, where the importance of the network has never been more clear, we believe much of this demand is attributable to our strong execution across our product management, engineering, and go to market organizations, which is enabling us to capitalize on significant customer initiatives. Examples of these initiatives that continued to see strong investments include enterprise digital transformation and office reopening project, 400-gig upgrade at cloud and service provider customers, and the broad adoption of cloud-based services and associated network architectures.  As we enter the June quarter, momentum is strong and I remain optimistic regarding our prospects for the year, despite the various supply chain challenges we are facing. I continue to believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory and the strong order momentum we\u2019re seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver solid growth and improve profitability in the 2022 timeframe and beyond. Based on a recent order momentum, current backlog level, and our assumptions regarding supply, we still expect to deliver 7% to 9% sales growth and still are targeting at least 8 points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2022. Our expectations for 2022 assume current supply chain challenges persist, and that we\u2019re unable to work down backlog during the year, potentially creating long-term tailwind for our business once the supply chain situation improves and backlog returns to more normal levels.  Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some key developments we\u2019re seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with Automated WAN, while this solution set experienced only modest Q1 revenue growth year-over-year, due entirely to the timing of shipments, demand for these solutions remains exceptionally strong as we experienced at least double-digit order growth across all customer verticals and all major product families including our MX, PTX and ACX offerings. We\u2019re continuing to see strong 400-gig momentum with our cloud and service provider customers, which should present building tailwind for our business over the next several years.  In this most recent quarter, I was particularly encouraged to see strong early interest in several of our newer Automated WAN solutions. To this point, our MX10k product family experienced a record quarter and our new LC9600 programmable 10-terabit, 400-gig capable line card, which leverages our latest Trio 6 silicon experienced the strongest adoption of any Automated WAN product launched over the last five years. We also saw another quarter of triple-digit order growth for our ACX Metro portfolio, and growing demand for our Paragon Automation software. With additional Trio 6 based MX products and new ACS Metro offerings expected to launch over the next several quarters, and new PTX products leveraging our next generation Express 5 silicon also coming to market next year, I am optimistic regarding the long-term growth potential of our Automated WAN solutions, and our ability to capitalize on our customers Core, Edge, and Metro requirements. Our cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 20% year-over-year revenue growth during the March quarter due to broad base strength across customer verticals and geographies. Orders were exceptionally strong in Q1 due to the momentum we\u2019re seeing with cloud major customers, as well as certain service provider accounts. Our 400-gig solutions are resonating in the market and we have now secured more than 70 data centers switching opportunities that span across clouds majors, enterprise, and service provider accounts. One opportunity, which I believe speaks to the strength of our data center switching systems and software capabilities is a meaningful new data center win with a top 10 cloud provider. This deal is already generating orders and is likely to drive meaningful revenue over the next few years. Customer interest in our cloud ready data center portfolio remains high and given the wins we\u2019ve already secured, we\u2019re increasingly optimistic regarding our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years.  Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to materially outpace the market growing 33% year-over-year. This strength was led by our Mist-ified portfolio, which surpassed a $400 million annualized revenue run rate in Q1, as both the wireless business and the related EX wired switching flow through more than doubled year-over-year to record level. Mist-ified revenue grew at 135% year-over-year, and we continue to see exceptional order momentum due to the success with existing customers and new logos. As a reminder, Juniper leverages the industry\u2019s leading Mist AI engine, a modern micro services cloud, and a proven AI-driven Virtual Network Assistant Marvis to improve customer operations across the smallest to the largest customer environments. The ability to scale cost effectively, to reduce IT helpdesk tickets, to quickly remediate problems, and to rapidly introduce new business enhancing services are among the reasons customers of all sizes are swapping out the competition and standardizing on Mist AI. While many of these capabilities are well known, Juniper also delivered industry-leading location-based services based on Mist AI, which is incredibly important to certain verticals such as retail.  We\u2019re also seeing strong interest from enterprises, as they readied their offices for return to work. Recognizing this point of critical differentiation, Gartner recently lifted Juniper mist as a Magic Quadrant leader for location-based services, making us the only vendor to make the leaders Quadrant for both wired and wireless access and location-based services, which is an important validation that we believe is likely to further benefit demand. Despite our lead, we are continuing to invest in our Mist AI differentiation. In Q4 of 2021, we acquired WiteSand, a small private company with exceptional talents that will accelerate our development of a cloud native network access control solution. We believe this solution will prove highly attractive to many customers, which has grown frustrated by existing on-prem solutions, which are expensive and difficult to both deploy and manage. And not to be overlooked, we continue to make progress Mist-ifying our 128 Technology SD-WAN solution. The completion of this process is expected to further cement our ability to provide the industry\u2019s best assured and secure connectivity experience from client to cloud. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum that 128 Technology is experiencing with recent wins with Fortune 200 enterprises in the US and the large financial services organizations in Europe. Based on our recent order momentum, third party validation, and the technical superiority of our AI-driven enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook of our AI driven enterprise business. Our security revenues slightly declined in Q1 year-over-year, but I continue to expect growth for this business. My confidence is fueled by the efficacy with performance of our firewall products, which were recently ranked number one by ICSA, a leading third-party independent security testing company, for a fifth consecutive quarter with 100% detection rate against cyber threats that top results achieved but all other security peers. Customers are telling us that in light of ongoing geopolitical difficulties, 100% security effectiveness is more important than ever, and give Juniper a unique competitive advantage. I believe the convergence of networking and security will only increase across the markets we serve and I\u2019m confident that this will present a competitive advantage in all of our strategic customer use cases. Importantly, we continue to make progress transitioning our business to a more software-centric model by transforming more of our perpetual offering to turn-based licenses, introducing more radical subscription offerings, and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack. While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced another quarter of encouraging momentum in the Q1 timeframe, which saw total software and related services revenue grew by 60% year-over-year to account for 20% of our total revenue. Software orders were also strong in the period increasing by more than 80% year-over-year. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services, increased 30% year-over-year, due to the strong demand for Mist and security subscriptions. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in our efforts to capture more software revenue, which we view as critical to not only accelerating growth, but also improving customer stickiness and margin. Our services team delivered another impressive quarter due to strong services renewal and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also delivered record service margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and it\u2019s focused on driving innovation through automation and cloud delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and the customer experience.  Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on our Silicon Photonics efforts, which had been focused on disrupting the optical component market through unmatched optical integration that would result in lower cost and superior power efficiency as compared to traditional solutions in the market. Through our investment, and working closely with customers and partners, we\u2019ve validated the advantages of our integrated hybrid laser technology and the broad market opportunity with applications and networking data center disaggregation AI, LiDAR and beyond. However, we learned that the full potential of this opportunity would be best realized if we could enable a large ecosystem of partners to design on the technology and derive volume economics. In order to capitalize on this broader opportunity set, we have created a new company that has launched the first open foundry platform for integrated Silicon Photonics. Synopsys has acquired a majority interest in this new company. They are an ideal partner to launch this company, as they bring deep expertise and customer presence, as a leader in intellectual property licensing and semiconductor design. We believe this new entity will be better equipped to target the broad array of Silicon Photonics opportunities that technology can address through both discrete components sales and licensing models. We will also maintain an ownership interest in the new entity that will allow us to benefit from its product as well as the business\u2019s future financial success. Finally, you may have noticed our announcements that our Chief Revenue Officer, Marcus Jewell, has decided to leave Juniper for a new opportunity. Derrell James, Executive Vice President of Customer Experience, will assume the role on an interim basis. I\u2019d like to thank Marcus for his services and the contributions he\u2019s made to the company over the last few years. Marcus leaves our sales organization in excellent shape and I\u2019m confident we have the talent and the organizational tools to navigate the transition and maintain our momentum without any disruption. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2022 at $1,168 million in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 9% year-over-year. Non GAAP earnings per share were $0.31, in line with our guidance and increased 3% year-over-year. Product orders remained strong in the first quarter, posting greater than 35% year-over-year growth, and we again saw double digit order growth year-over-year across all verticals and customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges, resulting in customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for the extended lead time. After adjusting for these early orders for certain large customers, total product orders are estimated to have grown double-digits versus last year. Our backlog increased more than $300 million on a sequential basis. Looking at our revenue by customer solution, we saw revenue growth in all areas on a year-over-year basis. Automated WAN solutions revenue increased 1% versus the first quarter of 2021, cloud ready data center revenue increased 20% year-over-year, and AI driven enterprise revenue increased 33% year-over-year. Turning to revenue by vertical, momentum in our enterprise business continued and grew 19% versus the first quarter of last year. For the first time in our history, it represented our largest customer vertical. Our cloud business grew 13% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. While service provider revenue declined 2% year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, orders increased double-digits versus the first quarter of last year. Total software and related services revenue was $228 million, which was an increase of 60% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR grew approximately 30% year-over-year. Total security revenue was $161 million, down 1% versus the first quarter of last year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were cloud, six were service provider, and one was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 32% of total revenue as compared to 31% in the first quarter last year. In the quarter, we had one cloud customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.5%, which was below the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to the unfavorable product and customer mix, partially offset by an increase in service margin. As expected, COVID-19 related supply costs continue to be elevated. And if not for these costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis increased 5% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. Non GAAP operating margin was 11.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Cash flow from operations was $193 million for the quarter. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. We also repurchased $112 million worth of shares in the quarter. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2022 was $1.7 billion. I\u2019m very pleased with the financial performance in the first quarter. The performance is a testament to our team\u2019s dedication and resiliency through these challenging and dynamic times. Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We expect second quarter revenue of $1,255 million, plus or minus $50 million, which is growth at 7% year-over-year. We continue to experience significant supply chain-related headwinds associated with elevated component, freight and logistics costs, which are expected to continue throughout the year. We also expect to see a decrease in service margin on a sequential basis. Therefore, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 58%, plus or minus 8%, which is up sequentially at the midpoint. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.45, plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 330 million shares. Turning to our expectation for the full year 2022, I like to echo Rami\u2019s sentiment with respect to the war between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, I\u2019d like to point out that we do not expect this ongoing conflict to have a material impact on our business. Given the strong order momentum and current backlog, we continue to expect 7% to 9% revenue growth for the full year. This assumes the supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year, similar to current levels, and does not further deteriorate. We expect revenue to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year. We expect supply chain constraints to be particularly tight during the second quarter and remain challenged throughout the year. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels throughout the course of the year. Moving on to non-GAAP gross margin, which can be difficult to predict due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We expect to see sequential improvement through the year. However, given our current view of freight costs and other pressures on supply chain costs, we now expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be below the midpoint of our 58% to 60% range. We remain committed to discipline expense management and will target full year non-GAAP operating margin expansion of at least 100 basis points versus 2021. That said we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis, consistent with the guidance we provided previously. Our non GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 20% plus or minus 1%. Our non GAAP EPS is expected to grow faster than revenue on a full year basis. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is live. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if maybe you could unpack a little bit about what\u2019s going on with your cloud customers. So notable that you talked about a 10% customer breaking in but I wanted to see if you could dig into the patterns or behaviors of the cloud majors and what\u2019s going on with that group in terms of what are they buying and how do you see them growing in their contributions to your cloud vertical? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah, thanks for the question. What I\u2019m seeing within the cloud vertical is strength and momentum in ordering and in just our ability to compete and win that new opportunity. I think that strength is broad based. We\u2019re capitalizing on existing footprint that we have in both our tier one as well as our cloud major space. Most of that footprint, as you know, in hyperscale, is in routing, but beyond that, it\u2019s in both routing and switching. So while we have footprint, I think the fact that this customer class continues to invest is something that bodes very well for our business and continues to do so.  But then the other thing that\u2019s really notable that I think we\u2019ve provided several updates on key wins that we\u2019ve had of net new footprint in the cloud provider space and there\u2019s one notable one that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. This is a top 10 cloud provider. We were already a routing supplier for this customer and then we had an opportunity in essentially one net new datacenter footprint that\u2019s quite meaningful, from an order standpoint thus far, but eventually it will become a revenue standpoint. And I think we won based on the strength of our engagement in routing that essentially translated to an opportunity in switching. We won based on the strength of our sales engagement, and also our ability to provide equipment in a timely manner, which was very important for this project as well. So it\u2019s a combination of real good solid industry tailwinds coupled with excellent execution of our sales and engineering team. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vod from UBS. Your line is live. David Vod : Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. So just quickly on service provider and cloud ready data center growth, it looks like the timing of the shipments due to supply chain had an impact in Q4 and then a snapback this quarter. How should we think about normalized growth rate for cloud-ready datacenter going forward, given sort of the volatility in the supply chain is sort of a 5% to 9% CAGR still the right way to think about it? And then, along the same lines, it looks like SP was impacted by similar dynamics this quarter, and also heard Automated WAN. Should we expect a similar recovery next quarter, like what we saw in this quarter in cloud data? And I\u2019ll just stop there. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay, let me start, and then maybe, Ken, you can jump in as well on this one. So I\u2019ll start with service provider. From an orders standpoint, I think we performed exceptionally well, the slight decline in revenue is entirely due to the timing of shipments, when we were basically able to provide product to our customers and this after the Q4 timeframe, where we actually saw strong service provider revenue performance, primarily, again, there because of the timing of shipments in that timeframe. All in all, I feel very good about where we are with our service provider customers, the strength of our solutions, the pickup of net new technologies that we\u2019ve just recently introduced into the market. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a new MX line card based on our latest generation silicon technology that we recently introduced into the market and it\u2019s seeing the fastest adoption of any new MX products in the last five years. I think that speaks again to the health of the market, as well as to the strength of the technology that we\u2019re offering. So, I still think that in terms of the long-term outlook for this particular vertical minus 2% to plus 2%, we\u2019re at if not better than that going forward. I think the other part of the question was around the cloud ready datacenter. There, from a revenue standpoint, we did very well, 20% year-over-year growth, and from an order perspective, even better. And I think there again, it\u2019s a combination of good industry tailwinds, solid execution. I talked about the cloud provider data center win in top 10. That\u2019s net new for us. That\u2019s just an example of the kind of win that we\u2019re able to achieve these days. Rapid adoption of new merchant silicon technologies in our product offerings. Apstra is a key piece of the end to end differentiation that brings industry leading automation intent-based networking to our solutions. So there\u2019s a lot we have going for us in the cloud-ready data center vertical right now. And again, there, our long term view is 5% to 9%. I think we\u2019ll do at if not better than that long term view.  Ken anything else you\u2019d like to add? Ken Miller : Rami, I would just reiterate, I think for all of our verticals, including service provider, and all of our customer solutions, including CRBC, we haven\u2019t given specific FY22 revenue guidance but I do believe all verticals, all customer solutions could be at or better than the long-term model that we put out there. In any given quarter, you\u2019re going to see a little bit of anomalies, which is really going to be shipment based or supply chain based and you mentioned a couple of you saw last quarter and this last Q4 and that will continue. But for the long run weeks, we feel very good about all verticals, all customer solutions. David Vod : All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Rami. Ken Miller : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check back on the sequential product gross margin weakness. I know you guys talked a little bit about customer mix, and also the cost. But I wonder if you could dig into the mix side of it a little bit and talk about how much of that is temporary, give us any more color you can give us on the mix and how that affected the margins? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Absolutely. And if you go back, if you\u2019re looking at on a trend basis, the biggest impact to product gross margin by far are going to be these kind of COVID-related supply constrained related costs that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. And even in Q1, the most recent quarter here, we posted 57.5% gross margin, it would have been approximately 250 basis points higher, nearly 60% if not for some of these costs that we do believe will be transitory. But if you compare it to the guidance, I mean, obviously, we knew about much of that cost, so we set our guide at 58% and we came in at 57.5%. That is a systems mix or kind of a hardware mix issue.  And in particular, MX was down a bit and this was from a shipping perspective, obviously, it has to do with our ability to procure the components and ship the product. We don\u2019t have the demand issue with MX, it was actually very strong and we\u2019re building a lot of backlog. But from what we shipped in Q1, we shipped a little bit less MX than we anticipated and we shipped a little bit more missed access points, which at the time of shipment carries a relatively low margin compared to the rest of our portfolio but obviously, as we sell more software and we recognize that software, which happens over time, it is margin positive over the long run. But in Q1 specifically, a little less MX than we expected to ship and a little more access points, not really the primary driver in the 50 basis points miss from our guidance. Rod Hall : And then maybe follow that up with just an additional question on that same topic. Do you guys have any line of sight to that supplier? Is it just all these disruptions that make it impossible to know when supply there gets a little bit better? I know that\u2019s been kind of an ongoing supply issue for you, so just wondering what the visibility looks like here. Rami Rahim : Yeah, it\u2019s difficult to predict in any given 90 days what we\u2019re going to shoot more of or less of, it\u2019s even difficult to predict beyond that. I mean, I would say from several quarters now, we\u2019re seeing is kind of a series of continuous disruptions, whether it\u2019s COVID related shutdowns or material shortages, logistics bottlenecks, even the war in Ukraine, and we\u2019ve even had some system outages with some of our suppliers and partners. We continue to navigate through these disruptions to the best of our ability. At this point in time, I think it\u2019s prudent to presume we\u2019ll have more unpredictable disruptions for the next couple quarters. I have to admit, I was a little more bullish on potentially seeing improvements in the second half of \u201822 at the beginning of the year than I am now. I now don\u2019t anticipate significant improvements throughout the entire year and I do think we\u2019ll see improvements in 2023. I still feel we\u2019ll get the supply necessary, obviously, to get to our revenue goals of 7% to 9% this year, and that will be up year-on-year. We will grow revenue faster this year than last year as an example, so supply will be more plentiful and absolute, but it\u2019ll still be very constrained as compared to what our demand signals are and our ability to ship even more. Rod Hall : Are you guys -- given that change, are you guys expecting the 1.8 billion a backlog? I know you said to kind of exit the year with that amount. Do you -- is there upward pressure on that now? Do you think maybe the backlog you exit was a little bit higher than that or are you still thinking that you can kind of stick to that? I guess it was 1.8, if I\u2019m remembering right. Rami Rahim : Yeah, it was 1.8. We did grow it greater than 300 million this last quarter. It\u2019s hard to predict, Rod, with any certainty where we are going to land. But I will tell you this, it will be significantly elevated, whether it is 1.8 or 2.1 somewhere in that order of magnitude would be my expectation as we exit the year. So if supply does not get better later this year, obviously that will result in even more opportunity in 2023 and beyond, as we exited the year with significantly elevated backlog. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks. Just following up on that last question first, just curious as I think in your 10-K filings you noted that the backlog that you\u2019re carrying definitely extends out 12 months. That 2.1 billion plus that you\u2019re carrying now, how would you characterize the duration of that relative to what maybe you saw coming out of last quarter? And I have a quick follow up, if I can, as well. Rami Rahim : Yeah, I would day the duration is similar to what we saw last quarter. Just to clarify, I mean, customers are largely looking for the product sooner than we\u2019re able to supply. So that kind of 12 month horizon is unfortunately a -- because of the supply constraints we\u2019re seeing and the lead times that we\u2019re dealing with, customers are actually interested in getting product sooner than we\u2019re able to deliver. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. And then as a quick follow up, going back to Simon\u2019s question on the data center footprint, it sounds like a big deal. I think, Ken, in the past, you\u2019ve been reluctant to think about data center switching wins as a big opportunity for Juniper inside some of the major cloud vendors. Has your opinion changed on that? And how would you characterize or what was the competitive -- was it a competitive displacement? Just any kind of further additional color on that seemingly large cloud win? Rami Rahim : Yeah, Aaron, that\u2019s a good question. So we have been reluctant to call a hyperscale data center win because there are very few number of hyperscale customers that are -- that use OEMs for their data centers. So let\u2019s just say there are very few at that, which we are completely continuing to compete for, but at this point in time, we\u2019re just not announcing any. That said, we\u2019ve all along said that the opportunity beyond hyperscale is large with many at that. And we absolutely saw that is a strategic opportunity for us to go in to compete for, to take more than our fair share, and we\u2019re doing just that.  So this net new is a perfect example of a non-hyperscale, top 10, very meaningful in terms of orders and revenue, where we competed on the strength of our switching technology, the engagement that we already have with the customer in the routing side that we were able to translate into the switching side, the ability for us to do when necessary achieve pretty difficult tasks of getting the supplies, when it was in fact required and requested by the customer. So, all of the above led to a sizeable win. And I want to be clear that we continue to see a large net new opportunities before us, both in hyperscale and in cloud majors beyond hyperscale, in routing, and in switching that we\u2019re competing for, and I feel very good about our opportunity to win more of these types of really lucrative deals just based on all of what I\u2019ve mentioned. Aaron Rakers : Great. Congratulates. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is live. George Notter : Hi, thanks a lot. I guess I wanted to ask about pricing. I think you guys looking back have taken a couple of pricing actions. But could you give us an update on where you stand there? How much extra price have you embedded into the price list and maybe talk about when that flows into the model and is there some potential for additional pricing increases going forward? Rami Rahim : Yeah, we have taken a couple actions, pretty significant actions last year. It will take some time for that flow into the model, given the strength of our backlog, but we do expect to see some benefit of last year\u2019s actions in the second half of this year. So we\u2019ll start to realize some of that here in a few quarters. As far as future actions, we are always looking at opportunities that we think makes sense for us to take advantage of nothing to announce on this call, but you could count on us continuing to look at all options and making pricing decisions that we think make the best sense for Juniper moving forward. And we haven\u2019t quantified the previous actions but really our intent here is to offset some of the gross profit dollars that we are going -- that we were losing due to the cost increases that we\u2019re seeing. There is a timing lag here where we\u2019re seeing the cost increases hit much sooner, and some of these pricing actions are going to take a few quarters to materialize. George Notter : Got it. And then also one of the things I noticed you guys seem to be hiring pretty aggressively just looking at your headcount numbers. I know there was a little acquisition in here also, but can you talk about where the sales and marketing investments are going and when you expect to start to see the yield out of those investments? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah, no, it\u2019s a great question. I mean, headcount is up and we talked about this year OpEx, we expect to be up as well, on a full year basis compared to last year. We do absolutely expect to remain very prominent in our OpEx spending and we absolutely expect to outpace -- revenue to outpace OpEx this year, which is why we feel confident we could expand our operating margin, and we continue to target 100 basis points improvement in operating margin. From a headcount perspective and where are we investing in general, the majority of it is go to market, the majority of it is in the enterprise space, where we believe we have an opportunity to really take advantage of the portfolio differentiation that we have, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re thinking beyond this current quarter and next quarter and thinking for the next several years to make sure we take advantage of the opportunity that we see in the marketplace. These do take -- when you hire sales, folks, obviously, there is a learning curve and a productivity ramp and we\u2019ve modeled a lot of it in and we feel very good that we could continue to outpace the market in enterprise like we have been and continuing to invest everything who does give us years of revenue momentum to come. George Notter : Got it. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question. Is just full staff is always a bit of a debater on the durability of demand that you\u2019re seeing. So, Rami, if you look at your backlog, which is north of 2 billion, I think which you said, if you just talk about the quality of this backlog and your comfort and confidence around this, I mean, I guess if I look at the trajectory of how this backlog has built up, it should imply normally you see high single digit top line growth in \u201822 but perhaps even for the years after that. So, walk me through the puts and takes around in terms of does this enable you to see high-single digit growth on a multi-year basis versus just a one year? Rami Rahim : Yeah, so we\u2019re not prepared to provide you know, specifics on 2023. I will say this, last year, we did 6.5% revenue growth on a full year basis, this year we\u2019re expecting 7% to 9% growth on a full year basis and we are expecting to exit the year with significantly elevated backlog, so that does give us a lot of confidence in 2023. We\u2019ve been outperforming the model and I think there\u2019s really no reason to believe we won\u2019t just continue to outperform in 2023, especially if supply chain starts to normalize because we do have the backlog built up and the opportunity to turn into revenue, I think will be with us for not just 2023, but quite honestly, a few years to come. Amit Daryanani : If I can just kind of follow up on this, when you think about this outperformance, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s accelerating over here right now for you. What do you attribute that because I don\u2019t think that end markets are doing some degree growth that I\u2019m guessing. From a Juniper perspective, do you think it is share gains or is it you are just able to get somewhat better suppliers than some of your peers and that\u2019s somewhat helping you out? So I\u2019m just curious, what do you think are the components of enabling the share grain for you right now? Rami Rahim : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I do think we have done a really good job of managing what is a difficult supply situation, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary factor. I think the primary factor is a number of things. One is healthy demand dynamics in the market, really strong product differentiation, solution differentiation, in the use cases that we are maniacally focused on and have been focused on for the last several years, and then solid execution. I mean, take, for example, our AI driven enterprise business grew 33% year-over-year in terms of revenue, and also exceptional order growth. That\u2019s driven by what is as a market leading, very differentiated. No longer just Wi-Fi, it\u2019s really an enterprise architecture that\u2019s cloud delivered AI-driven solution based on the Mist acquisition, but expanded to include EX switching and SD-WAN, it really is the best solution in the market.  I can also say the same thing about our data center now, with the combination of Apstra for automation, and our Underlay switching technology. The differentiation is solid. It addresses the key pain point for our customers and it\u2019s working. And an even an Automated wAN, where we have these new product introductions in the MX with brand new silicon technology, so we\u2019re essentially starting just now a new product cycle associated with the MX and PTX continuing to perform I think the strength of that solution is helping us out tremendously in winning net new opportunities in the market. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is live. Jim Suva : Thank you. In your prepared comments, Rami, you mentioned some new wins and I think you\u2019d mentioned the word they could be significant or material. Were those new wins after you gave your full year 2022 guidance, are they kind of new since then? And I\u2019m just trying to get a view when you say significant, are you talking like top 10 customer? So just any clarity to help us, I guess, that calibrate the excitement and optimism around that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah, so I\u2019ll take the question. We\u2019re very excited about the win and the opportunity, it absolutely has been meaningful to our orders strength, and it will soon be meaningful to our revenue results going forward from a size of customer perspective. That said, Jim, honestly, our revenue guide of 7% to 9% is more based on supply than anything else and our supply picture has not changed. If anything, I would say, my optimism that might get better in the second half is probably a little lessons today than it was 90 days ago. So it\u2019s really a matter of who gets the supply, not so much if we have incremental customers and incremental demand, can we upside our revenue, because the supply is kind of fixed at what it is. But this customer has the potential to be a very meaningful customer for us, I would say, yes, a top 10 customer for us in certain quarters, depending on when products ship. Ken Miller : And just to add, Jim, I\u2019m excited. Cloud-ready data center grew 20% year-over-year. I don\u2019t think that the market is growing that fast at this point in time. And I\u2019m excited not just by this specific win but what this win, in addition to the ones prior to this one that we\u2019ve also talked about, means for us in our ability to win even more going forward. We\u2019re now competing with new technology that\u2019s in the market, technology that we have been working with our teams together on for years that\u2019s now in the market. And so we have a much better understanding of the competitive landscape, what we\u2019re up against in terms of pure technologies. And the fact that we are able to win these new solutions in a competitive space gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to do even more going forward. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Ken Miller : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. A couple of questions for me. One, just any additional context you could give on what you\u2019re seeing as far as supply chain constraints on maybe more of the specialized networking tips versus some of the general componentry and just if there\u2019s any different trends there. And then the second question may be builds upon that of last quarter, you guys had had some availability kind of free up on the service provider side. And so just kind of wondering, is it some of the constraints on the service provider side just coming from the new products or just what has kind of changed from maybe categories of semiconductors that you\u2019re waiting for? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah, so when it comes to kind of chips versus general components, I really -- the answer is it, unfortunately, it\u2019s a bit of a whack a mole game. I mean, it really does kind of go back and forth a bit depending on the situation, depending on the quarter. Right now, I would say we\u2019re constrained pretty much across the board, I would say relatively equally between some of our higher end ASICs, and some of those lower end transistors, if you will. We are scouring the market and like everybody to try to procure as many parts as we can across a broad spectrum of components. It\u2019s -- yes, we were able to ship more in Q4, but kind of a higher end rounding portfolio as compared to say, Q1 and our Q1 expectations, but that\u2019s really just a -- it\u2019s just a timing of shipments thing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a material change. I mean, we\u2019ve been -- we would have liked to ship more in Q4 than we did, right. I would still argue we were short supply in Q4. We were perhaps a little bit more short in Q1 but the shortages are persistent. And it\u2019s just really a matter of what we can build when we could ship and that\u2019s going to kind of fluctuate quarter to quarter. Meta Marshall : Got it. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is live. Paul Silverstein : Two quick questions if I may. Guys, I recognize that Mist in and of itself seems to be a significant differentiator for Juniper and your product portfolio in enterprise is far larger than when you entered enterprise, if I recall, back in 2008. But my question is, when you entered enterprise, way back when, in 2008, you had a [indiscernible] span where you took that business from ground zero, to, if I recall, about $850 million of revenue, it was phenomenally successful. The product launch was extremely exciting at the time. Again, I recognize it was just campus switching but it then proceeded to flat line when you hit 2015, 2016. My question for you is above and beyond the breadth and depth of the product portfolio today, which is very different from back when or so it seems, what\u2019s the risk that from a channel go to market or other factors perspective because it\u2019s never straightforward as it appears? What\u2019s the risk that notwithstanding the significant momentum you have an enterprise today that\u2019s similar to what happened back when that you get to replay of that scenario? And I realize the numbers would suggest that\u2019s far off but if you could address that question. Then I\u2019ve got a quick question about the Aurrion, Synopsys. Ken Miller : Okay, Paul, I\u2019m going to take a crack at that. I think the big difference today is three key things, maybe four, actually. One, the talent that we have leading the enterprise business that has unbelievable firsthand experience in what it takes to win all up from a solution, go to market, channels, you name it, really have talent with the right depth and breadth that can do it. Second, we did not just set out to solve the technology differentiation that we know is necessary to win but we set out to solve the go to market requirements that we understood based on the lessons that we had learned some painful ones in the past on what it takes to win and to win sustainably. And this, by the way, includes not just the direct selling motion, but the channel selling motion and keep in mind, again, new talent, new leadership to understand what it takes to win, and to create a fabulous channel motion to get this technology to continue to perform well in the market.  And then finally, of course, it\u2019s the strength of the solution itself. I think the level of differentiation that we enjoy right now in the AI driven enterprise in particular, but I would also include data center with Apstra is second to none. I have not seen this magnitude of differentiation, qualified not just by internal analysis, but by our customers, by third party independent analysts ever in the history of Juniper. So I have utmost confidence that this is not a short-term thing. This is a long-term sustainable, competitive advantage and growth vertical for the company. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate the response. And then on the Synopsys JV, those are in assets, I assume there\u2019s a decent amount of OpEx you\u2019ve been putting into that since you acquired Aurrion back, I think it was in \u201816 or \u201817. But can -- is there going to be a benefit to OpEx, now that I assume it will be shown as a minority interest on the income statement, you\u2019ll get rid of whatever R&D and any sales and marketing that you put into that and if you could respond to that. And any concerns from China lockdown? Ken Miller : I didn\u2019t catch the last part. Concerns on what channel, what? Paul Silverstein : China. China lockdowns. Ken Miller : Oh, China, sorry. So on the on the RNPCS [Phonetic], if you look at just our Silicon Photonics spend, it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s going to go to zero here since this transaction was closed, so year-on-year, we wouldn\u2019t see less OpEx spent on Silicon Photonics internally, than say last year. That said this transaction was contemplated for a while. We\u2019ve been working on it for several months now and it was factored into our plans for the year, so factored into our long-term guidance. We talked about OpEx being up year-on-year and absolute total OpEx, predominantly in go to market, as we continue to invest to take advantage of the opportunities that Rami just mentioned earlier about our enterprise motion in particular. So it is factored into the long term targets, Paul, is the short answer.  On China, we have not seen any real impact due to the more recent shutdowns, COVID-related shutdowns, obviously something we\u2019re watching very closely. We have reduced our footprint -- manufacturing footprint in China, but we still have some dependence there, particularly on the component side, but for the most recent shutdowns, we were so far unimpacted. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, but it is something we\u2019re watching very closely. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you guys. This is [indiscernible] for Jim Fish. Thanks for taking our question. Just thinking about the security business, we\u2019ve seen some recent deflated growth despite the strong market demand but you noted opportunity for growth kind of longer term here. Can you help us understand what you\u2019re seeing that makes you confident that we can return to some sort of security strength? And then any color you can provide in terms of how sustainable this is? Is it a one or two quarter bump or is it something that can kind of persist through \u201822 and \u201823? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m actually glad you asked. So I think first, it\u2019s important to understand that the way we look at our security business, primarily is that it\u2019s an attach business, to our strategic solutions, in particular, our AI driven enterprise, and our cloud ready data center solutions. And it\u2019s already absolutely helping and contributing to the success and growth of those particular businesses. Also, security has a strong software attached, that\u2019s good for gross margins, it\u2019s a profitable business, there is an element of our security business, that\u2019s high end, that sells to a relatively fewer number of cloud and SP accounts and that just tends to be cyclical. It really depends on the purchasing and deployment patterns of these large accounts that tend to buy sort of in bulk orders every now and then that makes the security business just somewhat lumpy. So based on the fact that we continue to see strength in our solutions that competitive -- the attach of security, I think, bodes well for us in the future and why I remain confident about this business. Unidentified Analyst : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to CEO Rami Rahim for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Rami Rahim : Thanks very much. I just want to say that I continue to be very encouraged by the strong momentum we\u2019re seeing in our business. I believe that our end markets are performing well. They\u2019re healthy. I think they\u2019re even recovering in areas that were in fact affected by the pandemic. I love the diversity of the strength that we\u2019re seeing across solution areas, across vertical market segments. And I believe that the demand strength we\u2019re seeing as well as the execution sets us up well to do very well relative to our long-term outlook that we\u2019ve already provided. So I want to thank everyone for the opportunity and the time today. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2022 results. We delivered strong top line results during the June quarter as total revenue of $1.270 billion exceeded the mid-point of our guidance and product revenue saw a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth despite ongoing challenges from a supply chain perspective. Demand remained strong and exceeded our expectations with product orders seeing double-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead times. While gross orders experienced a single digit year-over-year decline, this was better than expected given the difficult comp in Q2 of last year, when the duration of customer orders began to extend. Total product backlog increased meaningfully on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis to end at a record level, setting us up well for future revenue growth as this backlog eventually begins to normalize. Our focus on delivering solutions that improve customer operations what we call experience-first networking continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is evident in our Q2 results, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all customer verticals. Demand signals remain healthy and we are seeing attractive opportunities across our Enterprise Cloud and Service Provider markets. With that said, we are particularly encouraged by the Q2 momentum in our enterprise business, which not only delivered a record revenue quarter, but also saw orders increased by 20% year-over-year. We believe this strength is reflective of our sustainable differentiation and technology and user experience, both in our campus and our data center offerings, as well as the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization. We believe these factors should enable us to gain share and deliver sustainable enterprise growth in future periods even if macro headwinds start to affect our markets. Another highlight in the quarter was the increased diversification within our Cloud vertical, where we saw improved momentum with multiple hyperscale providers and continued success with Cloud major accounts, both of which are adopting our 400 gig technology. Of our top 10 customers in the June quarter, six of them were Cloud accounts, which illustrates the diversification we are seeing. We view our increased Cloud diversification as a positive development, which should position this business for sustainable long-term growth. Not to be overlooked, we continue to see healthy momentum in the service provider vertical and just recently secured a new 400 gig core win with one of the Tier 1 U.S. carriers. We're also making progress in the Metro market where we recently introduced several new platforms that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the market. Our teams are executing well and we continue to feel good about our ability to capitalize on big opportunities tied to enterprise digital transformation and clarification initiatives, 400 gig upgrades at Cloud and Service provider customers and the broader adoption of Cloud-based services and network architectures. Based on my conversations with customers, these opportunities represent key strategic initiatives that should present a durable tailwind for our business over the next several years. While revenue was a bright spot and customer demand remained strong, margin and EPS came in weaker than we expected due to higher than expected supply chain costs and lower than expected perpetual software revenue, both of which I'd like to address. First, from a supply chain perspective, the availability of remained extremely challenged during the June quarter, as we saw a meaningful uptick in the volume of supplier decommits. In order to secure access to additional parts and get products to customers as soon as possible, we incurred higher costs than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. While some of these actions will impact profitability over the next few quarters, they are also enabling us to access more parts and better satisfy customer demand, which should have positive, longer term implications for our business. Secondly, our software revenue mix came in lower than we expected, even though software revenue still grew 24% year-over-year. We believe the outlook for our software business remains strong and we are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing with our Junos Space Flex software, out-of-the-box subscription software and software-as-a-service offering, such as Mist. Much of this momentum can be seen in our deferred revenue from customer solutions, which grew 7% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. The truly ratable component of this deferred revenue, which accounts for more than half of the total, grew even faster, nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. In summary, demand remains strong and given the backlog we've built, along with the actions we've taken to secure more supply, we're now incrementally more confident regarding our top line outlook and our ability to ship products to customers. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 10% sales growth in 2022 and at least mid-single digit revenue growth in 2023. While non-GAAP operating margin is likely to be flat to slightly down in 2022 due entirely to the lower than anticipated non-GAAP gross margin we now expect, we still expect non-GAAP earnings to grow. We remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect margin to expand in 2023. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with Automated WAN, we delivered strong results in the Q2 timeframe and orders once again, exceeded expectations, but did decline year-over-year. Revenue grew year-over-year across all customer verticals, all geographies and all major product lines, including our MX, PTX and ACX families. We are continuing to see strong 400-gig momentum with our cloud and service provider customers, including the new 400-gig core win with the U.S. Tier 1 provider that I previously referenced. This win was secured based on the strength of our PTX product family, which delivered the superior scale, embedded security and power efficiency this important customer requires. I was also encouraged to see another quarter of strong demand for our newer MX platform leveraging our 306 silicon, including the MX10K, the LC 9600 line card and the MX304. These platforms deliver the industry-leading logical scale, embedded security and power efficiency necessary to meet the needs of the most demanding multiservice edge environment. We also saw another quarter of triple-digit order growth for our ACX Metro portfolio and introduce several new platforms such as the ACX7024 and the ACX7509, both of which provide industry-leading performance and expand the number of Metro use cases we can address. We plan to further enhance our Metro portfolio with new hardware, software, and automation capabilities in future quarters that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the service provider market. Our cloud-ready data center revenue was flat Q2 due entirely to the timing of shipments. Orders exceeded expectations, but did decline year-over-year due to an exceptionally large deal with a hyperscale account in the year ago quarter. Excluding this customer, orders experienced double digit year-over-year growth, and we continue to see healthy momentum with large enterprise and Cloud major accounts. Our 400-gig solutions are resonating in the market, and we have now secured approximately 80 400-gig data center switching opportunities that span across cloud majors, enterprise and service provider accounts. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains high and given the wins we've already secured, I am optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years. Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to materially outpace the market, growing 17% year-over-year. This strength was led by our Mist-ified portfolio, which grew more than 60% year-over-year, achieving another record quarter for both Mist Wi-Fi and Mist-ified revenue. We are especially encouraged by the traction we're seeing with large customers across the globe with wins at a global financial bank, a global car manufacturer, and a global furniture retailer, each of which recently purchased a combination of AI-driven wireless, wired, security and/or SD WAN products from Juniper. To build on this AI-driven enterprise momentum we continue to deliver groundbreaking new products that optimize both end user and operator experiences such as a recently launched EX4100 family of access switches. Like the EX4400 family announced last year, these are truly enterprise grade access switches born in the cloud with native AIOps ensuring easy setup and management coupled with best-in-class scalability, security and performance. In addition, we brought AIOps to indoor location services with recently announced features that simplify wireless access point placement and orientation and we are now delivering six generation AI driven actions to address even more common networking problems, such as DHCP failures and wired authentication errors. Based on our recent order momentum, third-party validation and the technical superiority of our AI driven enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook of our complete client-to-cloud campus and branch business. Our security revenue declined in Q2 due largely to supply chain constraints on our hardware platforms and a difficult comp in the year ago quarter. Despite these challenges, we saw healthy momentum in our mid-range firewall portfolio, as well as our software-only security offerings. We believe the performance of our products is industry leading, which has been validated by a number of independent tests. Most recently receiving a AAA rating from cyber ratings with a 100% block rate for our cloud firewall offerings. We remain confident in our connected security strategy and believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to deliver better results over the next few quarters. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered a record quarter due to strong renewals and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also achieved another quarter of solid service margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and the customer experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2022 at $1.270 billion in revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.42 below the midpoint of our guidance range due entirely to lower than expected gross margin. We continue to be in a supply constrained environment with unprecedented costs to procure components and deliver our products. We prioritize delivering products to our customers as timely as possible, which resulted in higher costs and lower gross margin. Product orders remained strong during the second quarter and exceeded our expectations. As a reminder, we are experiencing some order strength attributable to industry\u2019s supply chain challenges resulting in customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for the extended lead time. While product orders declined single-digits year-over-year due to a difficult comparison. Adjusted orders grew double-digits year-over-year, and our backlog increased more than $250 million on a sequential basis. We saw particularly strong demand and enterprise vertical with both gross and adjusted orders growing on a year-over-year basis. From a customer solution perspective, Automated WAN Solutions and AI driven enterprise revenue both grew 17% year-over-year. Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. Looking at our revenue by vertical, all verticals grew sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Revenue in Enterprise grew 15%, followed by service provider growing 6%. And our cloud business grew 3% on a year-over-year basis. Total Software and Related Services revenue was $213 million, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR who approximately 34% year-over-year and reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were cloud, three were service provider, and one was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 34% of total revenue as compared to 33% in Q2 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, which was below our guidance range primarily due to elevated supply costs related to the challenging supply chain environment and lower than anticipated software mix. We experienced a greater volume of supply de-commitments in the quarter, which resulted in increased expedite and component costs as we prioritized delivering products to our customers as timely as possible. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would\u2019ve posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 59%. We expect the supply chain environment to remain challenged through at least the second half of the year. Moving on to operating expense, on a non-GAAP basis, which increased 4% year-over-year, and 1% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 13.9% for the quarter, which was below our expectations due to the lower than expected gross margin result. We had $267 million in cash outflow in the quarter. The cash outflow in the quarter includes approximately $165 million of additional payments to suppliers and prepaid deposits as well as strategic inventory purchases and an attempt to meet our customer delivery demands. Approximately $115 million of lower customer collections related to invoicing linearity and approximately $75 million of additional cash tax payments related to the capitalization and amortization requirements for research and development expenditures of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, which went into effect on January 1, 2022. While we expect to be cash flow positive in the second half of 2022, some of these items are likely to also negatively impact second half cash flow results. Over time, we do expect cash flow timing differences to normalize and our cash flow results should be relatively in line with profit levels. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. For the third quarter, we expect to see revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year driven by the strength of our backlog, strong demand and an improved supply outlook. Our better than expected supply outlook is the result of strategic actions we have taken to improve our access to components. We will continue to prioritize delivering products to our customers as timely as possible. The higher costs we are incurring to secure supply will negatively impact margins over the next several quarters. In addition, we expect to see a similar software mix in the third quarter as we saw in the second quarter. These factors will continue to pressure our gross margin and overall profitability. Turning to our expectations for the full year 2022. Given the strong order momentum we have seen coupled with our current backlog, as well as an improved supply outlook, we are raising our revenue growth expectation for the year to approximately 10%. This assumes the current supply chain environment does not further deteriorate. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels through the remainder of the year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the full year 2022 is expected to be approximately 57% down from our original expectations of 58% to 60%. As a result of the supply chain constrained environment, we now expect to absorb approximately $155 million of elevated component and freight costs in 2022, more than 50% higher than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We believe these elevated costs will be transitory over time. In addition, software as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year is expected to remain close to Q2 2022 levels. In 2021, we implemented some pricing actions, which have begun to parse the offset some, but not all the increased costs we are incurring. We are planning to take additional pricing actions to further offset these incremental costs. However, given the size of our backlog, these actions will take time to positively impact our results. We remain committed to disciplined expense management, and we expect operating expense to grow slower than revenue. That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and our non-GAAP operating expense is expected to increase on a full year basis. Given the pressure we are seeing in non-GAAP gross margin, we no longer have line of sight to at least a 100 basis points expansion of non-GAAP operating margin. Our current expectation is non-GAAP operating margin will be flat to slightly down for the full year. We still expect non-GAAP EPS to grow on a full year basis. While the current global macroeconomic environment and the ongoing pandemic posed some uncertainty. We would like to provide some early color on our outlook for 2023. What the order momentum we are seeing our elevated backlog and current expectations for supply, we expect revenue growth of at least mid-single digits on a full year basis in 2023. We also expect improved profitability and margin expansion in 2023. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] First question is coming from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is live. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. I hate to ask you about supply chain, but I guess I will. Ken and Rami, what changed and I \u2013 at the risk of asking you to speak for not just yourselves, but other companies. There appears over the last year or two have been somewhat of a randomness in terms of a general trend of either stability or in some case modest improvement, but one or a handful of companies being impacted. We just heard [indiscernible] this morning, where stability. And I'm not throwing stones. I get it that it's a challenged environment out there, but what's accounting for the difference. And what changed in terms of the decommits for you? Ken Miller : Yes. So the supply chain environment remains very challenged as it has been for the last several quarters. Lead times from suppliers and to us are extremely extended. Sourcing supply is proving to be very difficult. And at times is coming at an increased cost. We did mention on the prepared remarks that in Q2 in particular, we did see a higher volume of decommits from suppliers. And this really forced us to pay more expedite fees and heavily leverage the broker markets more than we historically have. And that comes at a higher cost. So the good news for us is, I feel very proud of our abilities to navigate these curve balls and these situations. And we actually \u2013 as you saw, we actually beat our revenue midpoint for the quarter. And based on these actions we're taking, albeit, they do come at a cost. We feel confident that we are getting access to more supply. And we actually raised our guidance for the full year. So we do see supply getting improving from an absolute volume perspective, but it is coming at an incremental cost and it's difficult. I mean, every quarter seems to be a different challenge, but we seem to be doing a pretty good job in my opinion, navigating those challenges. Paul Silverstein : Key, can you give us a rough idea of how many decommits you're talking about and how that compared to the previous quarter? Ken Miller : Yes. It's difficult to quantify. I'll tell you that we had some large strategic suppliers that we were expecting supply early in the quarter than we received. We received some of it later in the quarter. The other impact we had was linearity in the quarter from a shipping perspective and invoicing perspective was also negatively impacted. So it was definitely greater than normal, Paul, but we haven't really given these numbers in the past, so it's hard to compare to historical norms. Paul Silverstein : All right. Can I ask one follow-up on \u2013 Rami, I think I heard your reference momentum or progress with hyperscalers. Can you give us any insight \u2013 more granular insight on what you're referring to? Rami Rahim : I'd be happy to Paul. So I'm actually really pleased with our results with our cloud providers all up. I think the name of the game for us in the cloud provider space is diversification. I think we're seeing increased diversification among the hyperscalers to Tier 1 hyperscaler. So if one of our top hyperscale accounts goes through period of digesting orders that they've placed in the past or finding is another one will step in and compensate for that with more orders. And that happened \u2013 some of that happened in Q2 and then brought more broadly, our cloud majors customers saw great momentum and not just in routing, but also in data center switching and in 400 gig opportunities. So all up, I'm very pleased with the momentum we're seeing and I'm optimistic about the cloud provider vertical going forward. Operator : Up next we have Tim Long with Barclays. Tim, your line is live. Tim Long : Thank you. Just wanted to talk on the enterprise business a little bit. So Rami, just if you could talk a little bit, obviously it's been a great market, good results this quarter. Talk a little bit about kind of the sustainability of the elevated growth there and a little bit on how you're continuing to invest and go to market and how you're pulling through whether it's traditional wired products or some of the SD-WAN or other new technologies that you're bringing into the enterprise. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yes, I'd be happy to. So needless to say, I'm incredibly proud of the team for the results that they're continuing to deliver in the enterprise segment all up, very strong growth, both in terms of revenue, but also in terms of orders that grew 20% year-over-year, diversity in terms of the technology offering. So obviously we're seeing continued momentum with our AI driven enterprise solutions, but even our automated WAN saw a really great momentum this quarter. And a lot of that was driven by a resumption in spend by the federal government, which was kind of weak for the last several quarters. And I do expect that some of that is going to continue. So I'm actually quite optimistic about that. We are absolutely keeping a close eye on any sort of early warning indicators from a macro standpoint, any sort of headwinds, but so far, and you can see it from the order momentum we're seeing, we're not seeing any of that at this point in time. And I think the team has done a really nice job of just focusing on more macro resistant segments of the enterprise market. I think that's working in our favor. I also believe that the kinds of technologies that we're offering to our customers be it cloud delivered AI driven solutions, highly automated data center solutions are the kinds of solutions that I think our customers or prospects view as very strategic to their digital transformation initiatives. And so \u2013 and of that, I think you're going to see just more resilience to any sort of issues that might come our way in the future. So for all those reasons, technology differentiation, our go-to-market team, just crushing it focusing on the right sub-segments of the market, I continue to be very bullish about our enterprise business going forward. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, one of the things that some of the companies I\u2019ve talked about, I\u2019d love to get your perspective is signs that macros and impact demand. Are you seeing any of that? I know the European revenues were a little bit weaker. But I\u2019d love to just understand if you\u2019re seeing anything in terms of elongation of sales cycles or anything on the macro side. And then just related to that I\u2019m curious, what gives you the confidence and the conviction to give at least an initial framework for calendar 2023 this earlier in the process? Rami Rahim : Yes. Amit, let me start and I\u2019m sure Ken would like to weigh in as well. So order strength remains robust and it remains robust across all of our segments. So I know when it comes to macro indicators, I think people are mostly concerned about what might happen to the enterprise, but you saw there, enterprise revenue double digit growth, enterprise orders growing at 20% year-over-year. We\u2019re not going to be immune to any sort of major macro changes that happen. But we\u2019ve got our early warning indicators sort of \u2013 we\u2019re sort of scoping and making sure that there isn\u2019t anything to be concerned about. And thus far I\u2019d say there is not. I think we are playing in markets that are large, that where we have relatively small share where there\u2019s tons of opportunity for us to compete. And we\u2019re competing with solutions that I think are very strategic, especially in a situation where there are going to be cost pressures and the need for IT teams to start cutting costs. So for these reasons, I actually think even in the event that there were challenges \u2013 macro related challenges we can do quite well. And with that said, I\u2019ll just pass it on to Ken for additional commentary. Ken Miller : Yes. On the FY2023 kind of framework, over the last several quarters, as you know, we\u2019ve built up an exceptional backlog. This is definitely providing us much greater long-term visibility than we historically had. Our backlog is now more than $2.4 billion, which is approximately 6x normal levels, so an exceptional backlog build. Also the investments we\u2019re making in the supply chain we believe are starting to pay off. We did raise the full year this year, the second half we raised to get to a 10% full year guide in 2022. And we believe we\u2019ll have access to supply to get to at least mid single digits next year. We haven\u2019t provided FY2023 guidance as of yet. The only guidance you kind of have would be our long-term model, which was at least low single digits, which we provided over a year and a half ago. And we felt at this point, given the demand signals we\u2019re seeing, given the supply that we believe will be able to procure, we think mid single digits is the right framework at this time, at least mid single digits. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you very much. Ken Miller : Sure. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod, your line is live. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi guys, thanks for the question. I had two for you. One is just the implied gross margin in Q4. We calculate about 1.3 percentage points, maybe 1.5 percentage points increase sequentially there off of Q3. And I\u2019m just curious what you guys \u2013 what makes you expect that? Is it visibility on cost or is it pricing or kind of what the driver is there? And then I have one follow up. Ken Miller : Yes. So without getting specific on Q4, I\u2019m sure your models are pretty accurate Rod. We do think the year would be about 57%. Really we expect there to be a volume benefit in Q4. We also expect to see more and more of the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken play out as time passes. So those would be the primary factors. Again, I\u2019m not providing specific Q4 guidance. I don\u2019t have exact mix prediction at this point. But I do believe 57% for the year is the right place to be right now. Rod Hall : Yes. Just if we plug in Ken, the Q3 guide that\u2019s kind of what we get \u2013 what spits out of Q4. Ken Miller : Yes. And I\u2019m sure your models are close. Yes. I just don\u2019t have the model in front of me. Rod Hall : Yes. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is DSOs are up a lot in the quarter, and I wondered if you could comment on linearity in the quarter and also, the driver for the DSOs is just supply shortage or was there\u2019s some backend linearity there as well. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. So linearity in the quarter from an order\u2019s perspective was very normal, right? We saw a very strong demand and bookings throughout the quarter. And we really didn\u2019t see any sort of abnormally from a linearity perspective. That said, from a shipping and therefore invoicing, we did see a pretty backend loaded quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had some supplier de-commitments and we had to kind of recover and react to that. So we did ship later in the quarter than we normally do that had an impact on DSO. It had an impact on the cash flow, but also had an impact on freight cost as we had to take faster routes to get products to customers in the commitments we made to them. So it had a negative impact on a few of our metrics. Rod Hall : Got you. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Ken. Ken Miller : Yes. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex, your line is live. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. So $2.4 billion plus in backlog is an enormous backlog relative to the historical norms of the company. And as we look forward if I were to run what the equivalent of a bank stress test on your outlook for a CY2023, it looks like you could produce 20%, 30%, 40% declines in orders for the next three or four quarters and right through to the back end of 2023, still hitting at least mid-single-digits or plus revenue growth and still end up with a backlog that\u2019s 250% to 300% of normal, is the backlog likely to increase as we go into the back half of the year? And how do you view these year-over-year declines versus the ability to sustain a book-to-bill somewhere in the broad vicinity of 1.0 as we go through the end of the year, because that\u2019s are really the critical variables to the stability and visibility of the 2023 numbers. Ken Miller : Yes. So, I mean, you\u2019re right. The backlog is unprecedented levels and, as how I see this year playing out, I can\u2019t give you a precise number here. I will say this, I think they\u2019ll remain elevated, kind of similar levels to where they are now. That would be my expectation as we kind of finish the second half of this year. And you are also are correct in that, the backlog should support our revenue for the next period of time, even if gross demand orders are down. And in fact, this quarter\u2019s a good example of that, where we mentioned on the call that our orders were actually down single digits. But we not only delivered 10% product revenue growth. We also grew backlog $250 million, right? So there was a fair amount of room there in orders. And that just gives us confidence in our ability to generate revenue for sustainable future. And that\u2019s one reason why we raised our guidance to at least mid-single-digits next year. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. So, the key point of the question was, can you, in fact, if you went through a stress test analysis like a bank, absorb 20% or 30% declines for three or four quarters, and still end up with that massive backlog given where you are exiting 2023, and which case the only real question then is the improvement in the supply chains, your ability to deliver on better than 5% growth and in the top line over that timeframe that you clearly have the orders. And a put note to this, just want to clarify, when you talk about the geographies in your print, that\u2019s a function of the timing of when orders came in. I assume these are first-in, first-out, and therefore not reflective of any particular change in demand in any particular geography, because it\u2019s, your backlog increased. So therefore I assume it\u2019s a allocation question, not a demand question. Ken Miller : Yes. So, you\u2019re absolutely right. If you were to perform such a stretch, test our model, our revenue model, given the backlog, we have would still sustain at those types of declines in orders, those 20%, 30% declines. So your math is correct. And again, that gives us a lot of comfort in our revenue growth sustainability for the next couple of years here. On the geo mix, I would say it is absolutely a factor of what we\u2019re able to ship? What supply we\u2019re able to procure? It\u2019s not quite as simple as first-in, first-out, because quite honestly, the supply chain is very dynamic, and we have shortages in some parts, and we have more parts available in others. So it\u2019s really about supply availability. And that really results in the revenue profiles that you see really across the board, geographically, as well as in some level \u2013 in some cases, the vertical cuts and the customer solution views is really about supply at this point. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. George, your line is live. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask about some of the mix items affecting gross margins. You mentioned lower software license sales in the quarter. Can you be more specific about what that was? I realize it\u2019s lumpy, it was bigger in Q2 getting smaller in Q3 and Q4, but what precisely was that? And what drives that the cadence of revenue recognition there? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes, George, let me take a crack at it. And then Ken, you can jump in. So total software grew at 24% year-over-year, that\u2019s a good result, but it was down sequentially. And that affected our margins because of mix in the Q2 timeframe. The software softness was really all in our perpetual offerings. And those can be lumpy, they can be \u2013 they can swing around positively or negatively based on orders of state certain capabilities from some of the largest customers that we have for routing and switching products. Subscription software importantly remains really strong, and you can see that in deferred revenue, you can see that in our ARR, which grew at 34% year-over-year. So, I\u2019m actually really confident in our ability to achieve our long-term software projections [ph], as well as our ARR. And then Ken, you can talk a little bit more about the mix issues in Q2. Ken Miller : Yeah. So as Rami mentioned, it really was a bit of a shortfall sequentially in our on-box Junos Space to perpetual licenses. These really are various features and functions of services that provide within our Junos operating system. And there is some timing of refract that's difficult to predict here. Some of it is on customer buying behaviors, whether or not some customers might buy the lowest base level operating system software at time of purchase with an upgrade to maybe an advance or premium license later. There's also some true-ups between hardware and software that happens periodically. So the timing of this recognition, it's all perpetual software, it's all recognized immediately, but the timing could vary based on what they buy and when they choose to buy it. So that's really what we're seeing here. Overall our software business continues to perform quite well. I think we're ahead of the targets we set for ourself a year and a half ago with the Investor Day both from an overall software perspective, as well as our ARR target. So I feel very good about our software transformation and moving forward, I expect us to continue to have a very strong software story. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I know last quarter, I think more of the narrative around margins was on a higher mix of missed access points, a lower mix of MX shipments, obviously components drove that mix shift, but can you talk about how MX did this quarter, how you did with access points, did the mix of those pieces go up or down in Q2? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah, so MX actually went up, so our hardware mix on the routing side and automated WAN side was up, that said some of these perpetual software licenses that I was mentioning before actually were attributed up to our automated WAN solutions. So the software mix with automated WAN was down a bit, some of these perpetual licenses that we've talked about, but overall the hardware mix was up. But it wasn't at the expense of access points. We continued to sell a lot of access points as well. You saw the results in IDE up 17%, so really strength in both the MX/automated-WAN business, as well as our IDE business. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, thank you. Rami Rahim : Yep. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from David Vod with UBS. Your line is live. David Vod : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So I have sort of two related questions on margins. So I think in the prepared remarks, you noted that supply chain going forward is getting a little bit better. So kind of against that backdrop, if supply chain is improving on the margin sort of quarter-over-quarter, along with revenue that looks like it's going to be well above trend. Why are you not seeing more gross margin leverage in the third quarter, despite the expedited fees, but it sounds like it's getting better? And if expedited fees are about 50% above your prior expectations, does that give you confidence and a line of sight into potentially a 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, just basically effectively pushing it out by year, what you'd expected for this year as we entered the year? Thanks. Ken Miller : Yeah. So on the supply getting better, is really kind of a nuanced message I want to make sure is well understood. Access to supply is still highly constrained. Lead times into us are still extremely limited. That said we've taken some action to actually procure more supply. So I think we'll have more supply than we originally expected when we started the year, which is a good thing. So that's an improvement in supply, but it's coming at cost. And that's really the offset here is that we are paying more. We're having to pay more expedite fees. We're going to broker markets and paying several times more than we should be paying for this, for that particular component in the open market.  So it is coming at a cost. So volume is improving but costs are going up is probably the short summary on the supply side. For 2023 on the supply, was it a supply related question as well? David Vod : Well, I mean, Ken, I think you said, expedited fees came in about above your expectations. So that would translate into a little bit north of $50 million or almost the point of margin. So how does that play into next year? Ken Miller : Yeah, so I do believe those expedite fees and component costs the $155 million that I referenced is transitory and exactly the timeframe is difficult to predict, but I do believe if you go out, I don't know, a couple of two, three years you'll see the majority, if not all of those costs go away. However, the timing, how many \u2013 the expedite fees we're paying, the elevator freight we're paying it's hard to predict exactly what we're going to start to see that normalize. I do think we should see some benefit in 2023, but I'm not ready to quantify how much. David Vod : Great, thanks guys. Operator : All right. The next question is coming from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon, your line is live. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if you could describe within your backlog, what do you see happening in terms of the major product categories and your market share? I\u2019m trying to get an understanding of where you\u2019re gaining market share based on your awards versus where you might be? Rami Rahim : Hey, Simon. Simon Leopold : Yes. Rami Rahim : Sorry. We\u2019re going to interrupt you. Could you repeat the question? We had a little glitch here. So we missed a part of your question and sorry to bother you, but we\u2019re going to need you to repeat it. Simon Leopold : No problem. You hear me, okay, now? Rami Rahim : Yes, we can. Simon Leopold : Okay, great. I wanted to see if you could talk about within your pipeline, your backlog, how you see your market share trends in the major category? So what major verticals or products do you see yourselves gaining share the most and where do you see yourself most vulnerable in the mix? I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about campus as an area where we\u2019ve seen you gaining share. I want to see if you could talk a little bit more broadly about other product categories and just confirm the campus? Rami Rahim : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. So I do think the one area where we are most obviously taking share is going to be in the enterprise and more specifically in the client to cloud. So that includes wired, wireless, and increasingly it\u2019s going to include a full stack solution of wired, wireless and SD-WAN because we\u2019re now pretty much integrated our 128 Technology SD-WAN solution into that end-to-end AI driven enterprise capability. So the numbers speak for themselves, double-digit revenue growth, double-digit order growth and all that. Very, very pleased there. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only place where we\u2019re taking share. I do think in terms of 400-gig opportunities now that 400-gig has moved from discussions and PowerPoints into competitive bakeoffs. I do think that we are winning share wherever there is a net new opportunity, be it for our service about our core, where I just talked in my prepared remark about our new win, new data center, cloud WAN opportunities. I do think and time will tell as this translates to actual revenue results and actual share results. I do think this is an area where we\u2019re performing very well and we are taking share. The last area that I will mention that I think is going to be an obvious place where we\u2019re going to take share, because we\u2019re really starting from very little is in the Metro. 5G is a real thing. It\u2019s driving fiber build outs by service providers. We are essentially very small players in the Metro because we\u2019ve never really had a complete portfolio and we just announced that complete portfolio and it should essentially come together and be fully in production by the early part of next year. So even in the absence of that solution, we\u2019re seeing a 100 plus percent year-over-year growth in orders for ACX. I think that will only accelerate once we\u2019ve got that complete solution. I\u2019m sure there are other areas where we\u2019re doing very well data center for example, but those the areas that I\u2019d say are top of mind right now in terms of the biggest opportunity for share take. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the questions. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Up next, we have Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is live. Angela Jin : Hi, this is Angela Jin on for Samik. I don\u2019t \u2013 I hate to ask the recession question, but I was curious how would each vertical respond in the event of a macro slowdown and what are the areas of a portfolio that you think are more resilient to a slowdown versus more aligned to cyclical trends? Rami Rahim : Thanks Angela for the question. I\u2019ll start, first, I think it\u2019s a hypothetical question, because I said, I think order strength remains very high. We don\u2019t see any obvious indicators that there is going to be macro headwinds, but of course it\u2019s our job to stay very vigilant and to just make sure that we\u2019re looking for any early warning indicators. In terms of what one would expect would be with the other challenging areas, service providers and cloud providers tend to have very strategic long-term projects. And for that reason, I would expect that they would be more macro resilient. But even in the enterprise where I would say that most people would expect that there might be the biggest risks if there were macro headwinds, there what we have going for us, as I mentioned earlier is we have massive TAMs, total addressable markets, 30 plus billions \u2013 billion dollars across our client to cloud and data center. We\u2019re relatively small player with small share, a very differentiated solution and plenty of room to grow even if there are in fact macro headwinds that affect that TAM. And I think part of the results we\u2019re posting are a little bit of a proof point for that. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is live. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I hate to do this, but I want to go back to the backlog a little bit. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, I know you disclosed it in the past that you had implemented some price increases back, I think you said in 2Q of 2021. It sounds like you're going to implement some more actions here going forward. I'm just curious considering the significant amount of backlog that's likely been built over the past year let alone the $500 million through the first half or a $550 million through the first half the year. How do we think about those price actions starting to filter through that backlog and really starting to provide, maybe the positive effect to the gross margin understanding you've got a lot of supply chain dynamics going on? Rami Rahim : Yes. So it is going to feather in over time. We are seeing more and more benefit each quarter. So Q2 this last quarter we saw more benefit than we saw in Q1. And I expect us to see more benefit here in the second half from the pricing actions. The actions we're about ready to take, we really aren't going to start to play until probably FY 2023, given the backlog. And again, I expect that to feather in overtime and be incremental over time as we move into the 2023 quarters. The unfortunate reality is the benefit we're seeing is getting more than offset by the cost, right? When we put the actions in place, we had some assumptions on the incremental costs, the expedite fees, great costs, et cetera, and we undershot \u2013 we overshot I should say or the cost overshot those expectations. So we are seeing some benefit. There is more of the pricing benefit in the backlog yet to come, that's going to continue to help us in the future quarters. But at this point we just don't see that help enough to really keep the margin range where we started the year at 58 to 60. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And as \u2013 and just as a quick follow-up question on the continued traction that you're seeing in 400-gig, I know this quarter you had mentioned 80, I think last quarter you had mentioned 70 design wins. I'm curious if you were just asked like what inning do you think we're at in terms of kind of really volume deployments across those 80 design wins for 400-gig at this point? And when do you think actually we're halfway through those deployments, just kind of thinking about the trajectory of those 400-gig wins? Rami Rahim : Yes. It's a good question. First, I want to just clarify. The 80 or so wins are data center 400-gig wins, we've actually we're now seeing close to accumulative 400 wins across data center and wide area in service provider and in the cloud provider segments. In terms of where we are, I mean, if you looked at port mix between 100-gig and 400-gig, both in terms of orders and shipments, it's still at early innings for 400-gig. There are a lot more networks that are going to be built out with 400-gig. So we viewed these sorts of network interface happen once every several years, maybe four or five years or so. We're now at the beginning stages of one of those inflections and that's good for our industry, certainly good for Juniper. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Okay. Next we have Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe following up on the answer to George's question, you mentioned kind of some uncertainty on what addition might be elected in terms of kind of where the perpetual revenue comes in for software. I was just trying to get a sense of some of that volatility more \u2013 more pronounced this quarter just because of the amount of kind of cloud customers that you're servicing or just trying to get some insight into what is causing that volatility? And then maybe just as a follow-up question; just is this kind of quarter where you would consider inventory peaking, or do you still think that you'll be in an inventory kind of accumulation period for the kind of foreseeable future? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. So on the software volatility, we did, I mentioned buying patterns vary and the reality is in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we saw some of those above normal buying patterns where customers were either doing true-ops or maybe upgrading their software system from a base level to a more advanced or premium level. So we did see some of the, kind of the high water marks of that volatility in the past few quarters. In Q2, I think we saw a little bit more of a normal kind of hardware to software attach, and at this point I'm expecting the rest of the year to be largely similar to Q2. That said customers could surprise me and might upgrade their software stack here in the futures and will obviously be available for that when \u2013 if they decide to do that. So it's difficult to predict. I wouldn't call it out as any sort of customer pattern. It's really just more about timing of when they purchase perpetual software. And we had a couple quarters of highs and now I think we're back to kind of a normal from a perpetual perspective, as Rami mentioned, our subscription software, our SaaS software is growing well beyond normal, right. We continue to grow at extremely high levels on that part of our software portfolio. From an inventory perspective, I don't think we've seen the end of the inventory built. You know, we are still, if you look at our, open purchase orders we are absolutely putting a demand signal out there that supports what we think is our demand opportunity. And that's a, that's going to result in more inventory, what's happening out there is you're, we are definitely seeing constrained in certain parts, but there's other parts of the bill of material that are not constrained. And that's really the part of the inventory that's building up, as we start to get some of the more critical parts, we'll be able to ship, our backlog and we'll see the inventory level start to go down. So I don't think inventory's going to start to, decline until we start to see supply chains really improve and backlog levels start to come down. Jess Lubert : Operator, we'll take two more questions. Operator : Okay. The next is coming from Sami Badri with Juniper. Your line is live. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. First question is, if we were just to take the percentage of revenues in 2022, that reflect the price increase actions, what percentage of those revenues are coming through, and what is the objective of 2023, will 2023 reflect all price action increases and maybe just like a percentage mix of 2022? Rami Rahim : Yes. I'm sorry, Sami but that's not a level of detail I'm prepared to comment on, on this call. I'll say that, I would expect it to normalize by, call of four quarters out. So by the late this year, we should see some normalization from the action we took last year. But as far as the percentage of total revenue, I'm not prepared to comment on at this call. Operator : Okay. Next we have Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal, your line is live. Tal Liani : Hey, guys I want to go back to your 2023 guidance. It, I tried to look at it multiple ways and it looks to me either that you're banking or you're assuming very steep decline in revenues, in certain areas or that you're just very, very conservative. In the four quarters of this year, your growing revenues, the low is 8.3. The high is 13.5, so there is substantial growth this year. And next year we should see some of the backlog released, being released. So 5% looks, looks weak versus what we're seeing this year. And then also, if I just look at your enterprise growth, this year substantial growth, it's about 35% of your revenues plus that alone contributes 4% of revenues give or take next year. So what are your assumptions when you say 5% or better, the 5% mark, which I understand it's going to be better? What are your assumptions about the telecom market about the cloud market? When you project 5% or more, are you assuming end of projects, are you assuming declines or what are basically your basic assumptions in saying 5%? Rami Rahim : Let me start, I think the key here is that we didn't say it's 5%. We said, it's, at least 5%, or at least mid single digits. If in fact the markets play out, as we expect, and there aren't any major sort of challenges macro wise. Yes, the opportunity is absolutely there for us, not just to meet, but to exceed that's bar that we are setting for ourselves. It's just a little early right now. I don't think we typically provide color on the next year in this timeframe, but we thought we'd start at this point in time. And yes, I mean, I've talked quite a bit, even on this call alone about some of the catalysts around 5G clarification efforts, 400 gig enterprise. Yes. I mean, I think these are all catalysts that can give us the opportunity to exceed that outlook. Ken Miller : And I would just comment, its demand is not the primary driver of our revenue outlook for 2023. That given the backlog, given the strength, we seeing the momentum we have, all the things Rami has mentioned demand would definitely imply, a higher level than a, mid at least mid single digits. It's really a supply, a constrained view at this point. And the good news is we see the supply, constraints being lessened. We expect volume to improve, which is why we thought giving you a number greater than what you had historically, which was at least low single digits with the prudent thing to do at this point. Jess Lubert : Thank you, Operator. That's all the questions we have. That concludes today's call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question has a chance. With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2022 results. We delivered better than expected results during the September quarter as total revenue of $1.450 billion not only exceeded the high end of our guidance but also set an all-time quarterly revenue record for Juniper. Total product sales grew 25% year-over-year and we saw double-digit year-over-year revenue growth across all customer verticals and all customer solutions. Our gross and operating margin also exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, which was above the high end of our quarterly guidance. Our Q3 results reflect the strong demand we've experienced across customer verticals and solution since the beginning of last year as well as the actions we have taken to procure incremental supply and overcome the many supply chain challenges that continue to exist in the market. Our teams have executed extremely well over the course of the past year and these results are only possible due to the exceptional efforts from our go-to-market, product management, engineering, services and supply chain organizations, along with many others. This alignment across the company has not only helped us achieve strong Q3 results, but also should position us to deliver continued strength in Q4 and sustained growth in 2023 and beyond. Overall demand remained healthy in the September quarter with product orders being high single-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for customers placing orders early due to the extension of the lead time related to supply chain challenges. While gross orders experienced a mid-teens year-over-year decline, this was primarily due to a difficult comparison in the same quarter of last year, when there was a large amount of this early ordering, particularly amongst our cloud and service provider customers, where order patterns are now beginning to normalize as supply improves. We're paying very close attention to customers' willingness to both invest in new network projects and consume prior orders as supply becomes available, given the various economic uncertainties happening around the world. While we have seen some customers more closely scrutinizing budgets as well as the time line for certain projects by and large, we remain encouraged by the overall momentum we are seeing, which remains well above pre-pandemic levels and the expectations we had entering the year. We believe this momentum reflects the network's growing strategic importance to our customers digital transformation and cloudification initiatives, as well as certain cyclical tailwinds surrounding early-stage opportunities, such as 400 gig upgrades, where we saw accelerated momentum this past quarter with nearly 100 new wins spread across wind and data center environment. Bolstering our momentum is the most differentiated solution portfolio Juniper has ever had. Our focus on delivering solutions that dramatically simplify customer operations and enhance end user experience, what we call Experience First Networking continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is particularly true in the enterprise, while we not only achieved record revenue results in Q3, and a third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, but we also saw continued demand strength with orders growing mid-teens year-over-year. We believe our portfolio of campus, data center and wide area solutions is truly differentiated which, along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization is enabling us to capitalize on our customers digital transformation and network modernization initiatives and, in many cases, shift share from the competition. We remain focused on scaling our enterprise business, and I'm confident that our new Chief Revenue Officer, Chris Kaddaras, will bring valuable insights and experience that will further accelerate our enterprise success. Our cloud business also delivered solid Q3 results with revenue growing 24% year-over-year. Many of our cloud customers are early in their deployment of large-scale 400-gig upgrade and data center builds that are likely to present multiyear revenue tailwinds as supply improve. These customers are consuming prior purchases and forward revenue visibility remains high. The large deals we announced previously are performing, and we are competing well for several additional large opportunities that could result in additional growth in future periods. I continue to be encouraged by the increased diversity of our cloud business as we saw strong growth from four of our top five cloud accounts and continued momentum amongst cloud majors during this past quarter. I view this increased diversity and reduced reliance on any one customer as an important positive development that is providing increased confidence in this vertical's long-term growth prospects and our ability to navigate any potential lumpiness in customer spending. Our service provider business also delivered strong results in Q3, with revenue rising 17% year-over-year. We remain confident regarding our ability to grow our service provider business as our customers consume prior purchases, and we make traction with the metro routing market where our new cloud metro solutions bring superior scale, power efficiency and automation capabilities to the sizable and growing portion of the market. I'd like to emphasize that we continue to feel good about our ability to capitalize on big opportunities tied to enterprise digital transformation and clarification initiatives, 400-gig upgrades at cloud and service provider customers and the broader adoption of cloud-based services and network architectures. Based on my recent conversations with customers, these opportunities represent key strategic initiatives that we believe will present durable tailwinds for our business over the next several years, even in the event macro conditions soften. We also believe our focus on leveraging artificial intelligence and software automation tools to improve network operations and reduce cost is truly differentiated and creating opportunities to shift share. In summary, overall demand remains healthy. And given the backlog we've built, along with the actions we've taken to secure more supply, we are now incrementally more confident regarding our top line outlook and our ability to ship products to customers. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 12% to 13% year-over-year revenue growth in 2022 and at least 7% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points in 2023. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with automated WAN. We delivered strong results in the Q3 time frame. Revenue saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all customer verticals with particular strength in our MX product family where our newer Trio 6-based products such as the MX10K, the LC9600 Line Card and the MX304 continued to perform exceptionally well. We are continuing to see strong demand for our 400-gig products with our cloud and service provider customers and now have nearly 400 wins for wide area use cases across our MX, PTX and ACX products. We also saw another quarter of strong order growth for our ACX cloud metro portfolio, and our Paragon software automation suite. We plan to introduce new hardware and software automation capabilities in future quarters that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the service provider market. Our cloud-ready data center revenue also saw a strong year-over-year growth in Q3 due to the momentum with cloud major accounts. Orders with these accounts also remained strong and saw solid double-digit growth year-over-year as we continued to successfully develop new franchises and generate strong momentum with deals greater than $1 million. Our 400-gig data center solutions are resonating in the market, and our solutions have now secured approximately 100 data center switching opportunities that span across cloud majors, enterprise and service provider accounts. Our Apstra pipeline continues to build with qualified leads approximately doubling on a sequential basis. New logos saw healthy momentum, and we're seeing strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which is a positive indicator for future growth. With the recent launch of Abstract Freeform, which provides more flexible deployment options and expand the list of potential customers we can address, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for Apstra and our data center opportunity. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains high. And given the wins we've already secured, I'm optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years. Our AI-driven enterprise business continues to materially outpace the market with revenue growing 16% year-over-year and orders rising more than 25% year-over-year. This strength was led by our mystified business, which is a segment of our campus and branch portfolio driven by Mist AI and the cloud. This area saw both revenue and orders grew more than 50% year-over-year, with record sales of Mist WiFi and EX switching. On an annualized basis, our Mistified order run rate surpassed $850 million in the Q3 time frame, which is up meaningfully from the run rate we last disclosed during Q4 of 2021. We remain encouraged by the traction we're seeing with large customers, especially those choosing Juniper for full stack wins, which we define as a combination of wired access, wireless access, SD-WAN and/or edge security products managed via Mist AI. Notable wins for the AI-driven enterprise this quarter include the largest health care provider in the US, a large US service provider, a top global logistics provider, a global 10 international energy provider and several top universities around the world. We also saw a large renewal with a Fortune 10 retail account. Juniper continues to remain highly differentiated in the industry with our full breadth of wired, wireless, SD-WAN and indoor location product, all managed via common microservices cloud and sixth-generation AI-driven operations. This provides industry-leading insight and automation, resulting in amazing user experiences from client to cloud. Juniper continues to innovate aggressively in these areas as evidenced by several exciting product announcements this quarter, including a new AI-driven access switch, the EX4100, enhancements to Marvis AIOps that deliver even more insights into client experiences and groundbreaking new features that combine AIOps with indoor location services to save time and money, when deploying new wireless networks. In addition, we announced new features and payment options that facilitate the consumption and operations of Juniper AI-driven network as a service, bringing even more flexibility, agility and insight to Juniper customers and partners. Our prospects for the AI-driven enterprise have never been stronger. We're taking market share in key areas such as wireless, where the 650 Group recognized Juniper as the fastest-growing enterprise and outdoor wireless vendor in their most recent market research report. And we continue to be distinguished by respected third parties like Gartner, who have us in the leader position in two most recent Magic Quadrant for wired wireless LAN access infrastructure and indoor location services. As a result, the AI-driven enterprise remains a cornerstone of our enterprise go-to-market efforts and promises to be a key catalyst for the growth Juniper expects in the enterprise in coming years. Our security revenue declined in Q3 due to the deliberate shift from upfront appliance sales to a ratable software subscription model, which is likely to present headwinds to revenue over the next few quarters. While we also saw some lumpiness in our high-end security business, we continue to see strength in our midrange firewall portfolio as well as our software-only security and cloud offerings. Customers appreciate the value of Juniper's Security Director Cloud platform to provide a single policy framework to manage all their firewalls, whether in the data center or at the edge or whether on-premises or in the cloud, which is essential to help customers migrate to Zero Trust and SASE architectures. This platform launched in Q1 and already has more than 200 customers. We remain confident in our connected security strategy and expect this business to return to growth during the second half of 2023, as we build up more ratable software revenue. We experienced strong software momentum in the Q3 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grow by 21% year-over-year to account for 18% of our total revenue. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 38% year-over-year due to the strong demand for Mist and security subscriptions. We believe the outlook for our software business remains strong, and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Junos-based Flex software, off-box subscription software and software-as-a-service offerings such as Mist. Much of this momentum can be seen in our deferred revenue from customer solutions, which grew 11% sequentially and 50% year-over-year. The truly ratable component of this deferred revenue, which accounts for more than half of the total grew even faster, doubling on a year-over-year basis. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered yet another record quarter due to strong renewals and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also achieved another quarter of solid services margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving customer success through automation and cloud delivered insights, creating new revenue opportunities and also benefiting margins. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We delivered record revenue during the third quarter of 2022, at $1.415 billion in revenue, which was above our guidance range and growth of 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.58, also above our guidance range due to the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Product orders were in line with our expectations in the third quarter. As a reminder, we have experienced order strength from customers placing orders at an accelerated pace to account for extended lead times related to industry supply chain challenges over the course of the past year. The impact of accelerated ordering decreased in the third quarter of 2022. We expect this impact to continue to dissipate over time. While total product orders declined in the mid-teens year-over-year, due to difficult comparisons, adjusted orders grew high-single digits year-over-year. Strong demand in the enterprise vertical continued with total orders growing mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. Our backlog remains elevated, but declined sequentially due to improvements in supply. We would expect backlog to further decline as supply improves. We are very pleased with the balance of revenue growth in the third quarter across customer solutions and verticals. We saw double-digit revenue growth in all customer solutions on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Automated WAN solutions increased 39%. Cloud-ready data center increased 18%, and AI driven Enterprise increased 16% on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, automated WAN solutions increased 15%. Cloud-ready data center grew 14% and AI-driven Enterprise revenue was up 17%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. All verticals grew double digits on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Enterprise and service provider revenue grew 17% versus last year and our cloud business increased 24% year-over-year. This was a record revenue result for our enterprise vertical. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew 10%, Service Provider increased 11%, and cloud increased 13%. Total software and related services revenue was $248 million, which was an increase of 21% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $261 million and grew approximately 38% year-over-year. Total security revenue was $140 million, down 13% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were cloud, three were service provider and for the first time, two of our enterprise customers. 34% of our total revenue came from our top 10 customers in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 31% in the third quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.2%, which was above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher revenue volume. The supply chain continues to be constrained with long lead times and elevated costs. However, we have seen some improvement in the volume of supply. If not for those elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Operating expense increased 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to headcount-related costs and higher-than-expected variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.2% for the quarter, which was above our expectations due to the higher revenue and gross margin. Cash flow from operations was $52 million. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We continue to work to resolve supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will persist into 2023. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect to see revenue of $1.475 billion at the midpoint of our guidance, which is growth of approximately 14% year-over-year driven by the strength of our demand forecast, our backlog and an improved supply outlook. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.64 on plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 330 million shares. While the current global macroeconomic environment poses some uncertainty, we would like to provide some additional color regarding our current outlook for 2023. With the order momentum we are seeing as well as our backlog visibility and current expectations for supply, we expect revenue growth of at least 7% on a full year basis. We see an opportunity for non-GAAP gross margin to stabilize or slightly expand in 2023 on a full year basis. However, this will depend on revenue mix as well as the future trajectory of supply constraint related costs, which we expect to modestly improve over time, but to remain elevated relative to historical levels. With this in mind, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points on a full year basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to grow double digits in 2023. At this point in time, we expect to see revenue seasonality in 2023. However, the degree of seasonality will be directly impacted by availability of supply and may vary relative to historical trends. As a reminder, our gross margin tends to be seasonally lower in the first quarter with gradual volume related improvements throughout the course of the year. Any improvement in supply constraint-related costs is expected to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustained revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks guys. Congratulations on the great quarter, good execution. I guess what I wanted to ask you, Ken, was I think last quarter, and correct me if I'm wrong, you had alluded to an expectation that backlog would kind of remain flat through the back half of the calendar year. So it sounds like that maybe supply is loosening up a little bit quicker than you previously expected. Maybe you can just dive into the supply chain and how much of that backlog, if you will, kind of unlock or recognition is kind of helping drive your updated expectations, not just for this year, fiscal 4Q, but also through 2023. How do you expect backlog to kind of trend here as we move forward? Ken Miller : Yeah. That's a good question, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So yes, backlog declined approximately $100 million in this quarter, down to $2.3 billion, still an extremely high number relative to our past, and we're still enjoying a lot of visibility, great to the great demand in the backlog we built over the past several quarters. It did decline a bit, and that was really a factor predominantly of more supply, quite honestly. And you saw that in the revenue result as well. And we also raised Q4 revenue guidance a bit and raise next year. So we are seeing volume of supply start to improve. That should result in backlog declining over time. I mean, blacklog at $2.3 billion or at these levels is not sustainable, quite honestly. I do expect backlog to normalize over hopefully, a long period of time. At this point, I would expect backlog likely to decline a bit in Q4 as we continue to enjoy a little bit more supply and satisfy customer demand a little better than we were in the past. So I'm not surprised by the backlog performance. I still expect it to be up as compared to the beginning of the year and still extremely elevated, but do you think we'll start to see a decline here over the next couple of quarters. And next year, I think backlog, we're likely to decline as well at some point throughout the year. Our supply improved and lead times normalize, which I hope happens, we will see a normalization of backlog, I would expect next year at some level. Again, I still expect we'll enter \u2013 or exit next year elevated significantly elevated for that matter, but I think it will come down off of kind of record levels that we're at now. Aaron Rakers : Thanks, Ken. I'll stick to the one question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I had \u2013 the first one that, I wanted to start with, as you did mention earlier on in your prepared remarks about seeing some sort of scrutiny from your customers. But wondering, sir, what you're seeing from the service provider as well as the cloud vertical? I know, there's been a lot of discussion on enterprise customers evaluating spend more, but what are you seeing from the other two vertical service provider and cloud in response to the macro? And if I can just squeeze in a second one here, which is just trying to think about the gross margin guide for fiscal 2023 here, which does look a bit more modest than we were expecting? And sort of trying to think about supply visibility that you have and what could potentially drive upside to that number? What you probably like baking in, in terms of going back into the broker market for supply into that number? And what could potentially drive some upside to that gross margin for next year? Thank you. Rami Rahim : So Samik, thanks for the question. I'll start with the question around customers, and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about gross margins. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, demand remained healthy for the quarter. I think it remains above pre-pandemic levels. It remains above expectations that we had entering into the year. If you want a little bit more color about sort of SP cloud versus enterprise, I do think the dynamics of demand are a little bit different between those two segments. So if I look at SD and Cloud first, there was a huge amount of early ordering that was happening just a year ago. And that's starting to normalizing -- to normalize. I don't think it's completely normal at all, but it's starting to normalize. And so for that reason, I think if you want a view of demand, you really have to look at both orders and revenue. And the combination of both, I think are very positive for SP and Cloud and give us great visibility into next year, and it's why we feel good about raising our outlook for the following year. In the enterprise, there was some early ordering that was happening a year ago, but nowhere near as much as what was happening in SP and Cloud. And we continue to see great order growth, mid-teens order growth in the enterprise. I do think there's a market component to why that is. I also think there is just a differentiation, execution, the competitiveness of our offering, especially our AI-driven enterprise, our mystified solution that is doing so well in the market right now. Ken Miller : Yes. And from a gross margin perspective for 2023, I'm going to have to remind everybody, it's still a very challenging environment in supply chain world and very unpredictable. So I wanted to have a certain level of prudence. I do believe we have an opportunity to stabilize gross margin and modestly improved gross margin. A lot of that's going to depend on the timing of the transitory costs, the expedite fees and the freight cost, when and if those do come down, I think they will. The question is really when it comes down quicker than we're expecting in these forecasts, and we should see some margin upside next year. But I want to plan prudently from a gross margin expectation for next year. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is live. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could give us your insights or thoughts on what your product mix assumptions are for 2023 revenue. So, understanding that the sort of low end of 7% growth. But if you can maybe rank order your reported segments to give us a sense of how you expect it to perform relatively? Ken Miller : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Good question. So I think probably the best indicator would actually be our long-term model. Now the number of at least 7% is likely to outperform the long-term model. But from a relative basis, I still think the model pretty much applies. So I would expect enterprise to be our fastest-growing vertical followed by cloud and then the service rider be our slowest-growing vertical. If you look at the customer solutions perspective, I would expect to add driven enterprise to lead the way from a growth perspective, followed by cloud-ready data center in an automated WAN. So I do think the relative results will hold to the model, but overall, the company has outperformed the model in all verticals, all solutions this year. And I think next year, we have an opportunity to outperform the model as well. But I think from a relative perspective, those still hold. Simon Leopold : Thanks. And just as a very quick follow-up. EMEA was down year-over-year for you. Just whether or not you're seeing the macro really pressuring your business in that region on foreign exchange shifts or anything like that? Thank you. Rami Rahim : I'll take it. Honestly, nothing really -- there are no patterns, I would say, that would say EMEA is weaker than other regions at this point in time. I think the performance in EMEA was related more to our ability to ship product that was necessary in that time frame and the timing of deployments of solution. So we obviously keep a very close eye to make sure things do not deteriorate. But for now, honestly, we're not seeing anything specific in EMEA. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Rami Rahim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is live. David Vogt : Thanks guys. Hi, Rami. Hi, Ken. Maybe just a quick question on a follow-up on backlog and what you're seeing from customers. I know this is atypical, but can you kind of share with us how you're thinking about how that backlog converts into revenue over the go-forward period? I know it's different than it's been historically. But any commentary or comments you've had from your customers in terms of when they went that backlog shipped? And then Rami, to your point about conversations about customers being a little bit maybe more cautious. Any sort of indication on early maybe cancellation rates that you could share with us or anything that you think is quantifiable at this point, although it's low. I just would love to kind of get your perspective on that. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question first, and I'll hand it over to Ken. The answer to, are there cancellations, no. We're not seeing any cancellations, nothing that is atypical at this period of time. And in push-outs, there have been a few project push-outs, but there are also push-out in normal times as well. So there's nothing that I'd say is outside normal patterns. And again, this is where we obviously have to keep a very close eye on things and just to see how the market evolves. But so far, so good in terms of what we're seeing on the ground, conversations, projects that are happening with our customers. In the event that there is more macro-related headwinds, I think we have a few things that are going for ourselves. First and foremost, the diversity of our business across SP, cloud and enterprise because it's unlikely in my view that there -- all of these verticals will be impacted equally, and we can rely on some verticals that do better than others. I think that the types of solutions that we're offering our customers take, for example, our AI-driven enterprise solution that is all around reducing the cost and the complexity of running network really resonate with digital transformation efforts that are happening. And for that reason, I think there's a higher likelihood that such projects would be protected in the future, the competitiveness of our solutions. The fact that we have relatively small share in these massive multibillion dollar markets, all give me confidence that even in the event that there are going to be any sort of headwinds, we can actually do quite well through that period of time. Ken Miller : Yes. On the backlog conversion, I mean, customers place an order, they are, for the most part, aware of our lead times, so they're not surprised that we typically ship products several months, if not a few quarters after getting their order. I'd also say, in many cases, they actually want it earlier than we able to provide it. So the vast majority of our customers are trying to get the product quicker than we're currently able to deliver. The beta we have now, I would expect to completely ship in the next three to four quarters, and it will kind of be phased in over that period of time. So it takes a few quarters for us to turn the entire backlog given the lead times that we have. But we are doing the best we can to accelerate the orders in accordance with our customers' expectations when supply improves. David Vogt : Great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is live. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. I wanted to kind of understand how much the effect of increasing pricing on products has impacted both your fiscal 4Q of 2022? And how that really impacts 2023? And I guess, like every company has been moving at a little bit of a different pace, pricing products and offering customers different terms and RFPs, et cetera, but we're trying to understand when all these price increases finally make their way into the actual numbers. So that's kind of the first part of the question. The second part is if we just looked at just units, right, ports, units, appliances, devices, and we look at the number in 2023, does your guide of high single digit or 7% revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 include greater amounts of units shipped, or is that increase being achieved via pricing mainly just to kind of get an idea on how Juniper is doing. Ken Miller : Yes. So for actuals -- Q3 performance and Q4 expectations for this year, we are seeing an impact from the pricing actions we've taken over the past few quarters. It's \u2013 and it's actually increasing over time. So the impact we saw in Q3 was larger than we saw in Q2, and I would expect Q4's impact to be larger than Q3. And the impact is showing up in revenue as well as gross margin. But I would caution you on this year as well as next -- this year, in particular, the volume is driving significant growth. I mean, product revenue grew 25% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is unit based. It's taking market share. It's really not pricing that's holding up these results. Next year, if the number were to be closer to that 7%, you kind of the low end of our range, if you will, you'll see \u2013 I still believe volume would be the majority, but pricing would play a significant role in that overall result as we -- if we're able to outsize revenue with more volume, more inventory, more supply, you'll see that the volume is really the driving force. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is live. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Going back to the discussion on gross margins. I think, Ken, you're alluding to about 300 basis points of supply chain impact here in the Q3 results. I guess, I'm just curious about how much of that gross margin impact came from broker fees, expedite fees, that sort of thing. I'm wondering how much of that might fall off as the supply chain environment starts to get better going forward? Ken Miller : Yeah. So it was a little bit short of 300 basis points, but it is kind of in that 250 kind of range, 250 to 300 range if you were to normalize Q3 performance. And the majority of that delta is exit fees or purchase price variance, basically paying more to get the products that we want on time or earlier than we otherwise would get that, whether it's broker markets or paying extra for the part. So that is the majority. The other factor in that number is we still believe freight costs are elevated compared to where they're going to normalize at. So those are the two big numbers in that delta. I would like to think we'll see some improvement next year. I do think we're still in a very supply-constrained environment with the long lead times, and we still are going to prioritize satisfying customer demand to the best of our ability. So I don't believe those costs are going to go away entirely or go away anytime soon. But I do think we could see some benefit next year and particularly as we get into the second half of next year. But really, it's just too early to count on that. I want to make sure that we take it as time comes. George Notter : I know just to follow-up on that. I know you guys made a big investment in components a quarter ago. Is there a point at which some of that component level inventory will have flowed through the model? And therefore, you kind of go back to more of a market rate of pricing? Ken Miller : So from a price -- and to us or component costs are we talking about? Rami Rahim : I bought a bunch of stuff at cost. Ken Miller : Yes. So I mean, our inventory will turn when we're able to ship it, right? And the cost that we'll pay has been elevated, and I think will continue to be elevated if we have it on our balance sheet. So we'll be paying for the same cost. The good news is the costs go up in the future, we won't have to pay those costs. if we're carrying it in inventory. The primary reason for getting the components, though, just to be clear, is not some \u2013 is not really a cost-driven exercise. It's really about supply and resiliency of supply and making sure we can satisfy customer demand to the best of our ability. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I wanted to just kind of get a sense from you on what you're seeing in terms of cloud demand and maybe the difference between what you're seeing from your hyperscale customers versus your Tier 2 customers and if there's anything to note there? And also, just given that you had kind of a new project ramping, just how that influences how you look at cloud into 2023? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Meta. I remain very bullish on our cloud segments. Obviously, we had a great Q3 growing at 24% year-over-year. The strength is broad. It's in Tier 1 hyperscalers. It's also in the cloud majors. And it also is broad in terms of the technologies that we're selling into the cloud provider segment, our automated WAN solutions, our wide area transport solutions that is and more and more data center type wins. We've alluded to a few wins that we've had in the last few quarters. In fact, our engagement level with cloud providers across the board remains exceptionally deep at the engineering level, where we're engaging in existing as well as new opportunities and new projects. 400-gig adoption is very healthy. We've now seen roughly around 500, 400-gig wins in data center and the wide area across SP and cloud, maybe even a few large enterprises as well. And I think that speaks to the engagement but then also the strong differentiation that we have. So, all-in-all, I think cloud is going to have its ups and downs as always had but the general direction should be up and to the right. Meta Marshall : But just from a general how your customer -- like how those cloud customers are feeling about their budgets? I understand that you're doing very well within them. Just trying to get a sense of kind of how their budgets are trending or just how you're seeing their demand activity trend? Rami Rahim : In terms of the projects that are most meaningful for us, I think they're feeling good. As long as the cloud provider business is doing well, which they're all doing quite well, then they are going to need to invest in their network infrastructure to keep up with the demand for those cloud services. So generally speaking, I would say it's good. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is live. Paul Silverstein : Thanks guys for taking the question. First, a clarification and then a broader question. On clarification, Rami, if I've heard you and Ken correctly, you've got 500, 400 gig wins, 100 of which are intra-data center switching. Did I hear that right? Rami Rahim : Yes, that's correct. Paul Silverstein : Can you share with us what's been the growth on a quarterly or annual basis in terms of the number of wins? And what are the average deal sizes in trying to decipher what's the growth from the 400-gig upgrade cycle going forward? And then I've got a broader macro question for you. Rami Rahim : So, Paul, it's a good question, but I don't know that number off the top of my head. It grew meaningfully just on a quarter-over-quarter basis because I think we probably added 100 or so in the -- from quarter-to-quarter. And generally speaking, because these are 400-gig wins, typically, they're going to be fairly large projects. They're not necessarily going to be all large initially, but they are typically -- they start with an initial deployment and then the they continue in time. So -- and the last thing I'll say about 400-gig, whether it be in the WAN or in the data center as much progress as we've seen, we're still early innings. The vast majority of ports that are being sold and deployed these days, whether it be in the WAN or the data center is still 100 gig. So that transition from 100 gig to 400 gig is still in the process of happening right now. We should continue to benefit from it. Paul Silverstein : And Rami, to be clear, I assume your early innings with respect to both breadth and depth of 400-gig adoption. My broader question, if I may. And I recognize the numbers, your order book, your revenue plus your commentary relative to previous questions, it seems pretty clear, but I got to ask you, F5 reported tonight alongside you, and they referenced fairly significant, in particular, abroad, not so much in the US, North America, but they referenced a pretty significant pullback, downsizing delays, et cetera, in projects, I asked the question whether that was specific to the product market, given what you said, and they said they don't think so, given the nature of customer behavior abroad, what they're seeing in terms of the downsizing delays. But just to be clear you referenced some but it sounds like its \u2013 very \u2013 I am trying it to say for to what extent, just how meaningful in terms of number of customers, number of projects that will impact it on what that might indicate for the future, whether a downturn is coming or not for you? Rami Rahim : Yes. I mean, all we can say is there are certainly more customers that are thinking about their budgets and the time line of projects. Have there been projects canceled? No. There's nothing that we see that has been canceled. Have there been some projects that have been delayed? Yes, some -- but honestly, not much more than we would see in normal times as well. And is there anything that we're seeing that's sort of geo-specific like more in EMEA versus Asia Pacific or North America? The answer to that question is no. It's really kind of the same worldwide at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe I think back to what you just said to the prior question. You also talked about, I think enterprise will grow the fastest in fiscal 2023 versus that at least 7% growth bogey. Maybe just talk about -- how much of that yet is networking budgets, are you growing at enterprise companies versus you picking up share? And if the share gains are happening? Maybe you can just talk but where are you seeing the share gains in a more pronounced manner. Rami Rahim : So that's a great question. And obviously, we'll know for sure and to what extent there is share taking that's happening to enterprise once the share reports are actually out. And there's also an orders versus revenue component to this because obviously, analysts only see the revenue and they track revenue. But my strong feeling is that we're taking share in the enterprise. I think there is -- we're participating in markets that appear to be healthy. But I also believe we have some very competitive solutions that are in the market today across the AI-driven enterprise and our data center offerings as well. You heard me in my prepared remarks, I mean myst and our mystified revenue is crushing it. The last time we reported an annualized order run rate was in Q4 2021 of $600 million. We're now at $850 million in the Q3 time frame. It's no longer just about selling Wi-Fi. We're selling full stack solution. It's an enterprise architecture that's AI-driven and cloud delivered that runs across Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN. And if you look at our pipeline and our wins, a lot of that is full stack. I think the differentiation we have is just exceptional right now. And I think it will remain exceptional for a period of time. And we're going to benefit from that. We are benefiting from that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is live. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. I think a lot of people got introduced to your AI capabilities with the Mist product, and it's obviously been a home run and really changed the dynamics for the company over time, proven effective premiums to drive business and upsell. But I think the companies as a whole seems to have gone well beyond that, taking that same microservice cloud-native AI open architecture to the data center, taking it out to even the metro area WAN for service providers. And as I look at all of the moves that you're making in terms of the acquisitions you've done and the like, it seems pretty clear to me at this point that you've made a major pivot in your strategy to one that's driven off of that set of enablement to drive the entire company. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about when you're going to decide to announce this is the company-wide strategy. And the differences between your ability to execute on that strategy across the entire platform by getting employee buy-in and competitively, whether you see any of your competitors being able to follow suit because I don't think, for instance, Cisco could follow suit on this strategy. It's pretty broad change you guys have executed. Rami Rahim : Alex, thanks for the excellent question and the great insight. I think you're picking up on something that's really important. We've always at Juniper had a strategy around automation and being automation-led. But you're right, the AI-driven enterprise and the miscomponent of the AI-driven enterprise has taught us some very valuable lessons in how to take that automation and take it to a whole new level with AI capabilities, and with a cloud-delivered strategy. So, for example, in our metro solution that we're now selling to our customers, we've made the automation cloud first and AI-driven. I think we have the potential to do the exact same thing in the data center as well. So, what you've described is exactly what's happening at Juniper. We've learned valuable lessons from one segment and we're applying them to others. And we need to do a better job in sort of communicating that more broadly. I think that's great feedback and I appreciate it. Alex Henderson : Competitively, can you talk about your -- anybody else -- do you see anybody else able to execute a similar strategy or whether it's Arista, whether it's HP or whether it's Cisco? Rami Rahim : The more AI-driven capabilities we add to our solutions; I think the more of a competitive differentiation we give ourselves. And honestly, where there is an opportunity to sell anything AI-driven and cloud delivered to our customers is fun to compete today because we tend to win the vast majority of the time. Alex Henderson : Thanks a lot. Rami Rahim : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is live. James Fish : Hey guys. Nice quarter given the environment. You guys made some comments that the supply chain is getting better, I would agree with you there. And if it continues to kind of improve in the step function Ken, without putting you in too much of a hole here, but w hat would prevent Juniper from growing kind of double digits next year on some of this backlog flush actually? Ken Miller : Yeah. I mean the reality is the supply chain were to increase meaningfully enough. I would say, nothing would prevent us from growing double digits next year. Really, it is supply constrained at our at least 7%, if we see easing in the supply chain, given the backlog we have, given the visibility we have with customers and the demand we expect, the great part differentiation and the sales execution, this year is going to be north of double digits. There's really nothing holding us back next year other than supply from my perspective, and that's the reason why I want to be prudent with the model at this time. And we see a floor at \u2013 at least 7% or at 7%. We have not established a viewing at this point. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Fahad Najam from Loop Capital. Your line is live. Fahad Najam : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Rami, Ken, my question is around security. It declined a little bit. Can you maybe expand on what you're seeing? Is it that maybe security budgets were more first half loaded than in the second half? And are you seeing any pronounced impact in security in Europe? And is that something that is probably impacting your business more because of some macro? Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Fahad. So let me first answer the last part of it, which is no, I don't think there's anything geo-specific that we're seeing in our security business. Part of the decline is self-inflicted. It has to do with the transition that we're deliberately executing on at Juniper right now from an appliance-based model to more of a software-based model that's subscription-based and that will come with recurring revenue. And so for that reason, we expect that there's going to be sort of ongoing headwinds for a period of time, at least until we get into the second half of next year before we start to see a recovery. There's another element of our security, which is that, there's a high-end component that just tends to be lumpy. There are large customers that either buy or don't buy high-end security and Q3 was particularly weak from the high-end security standpoint. Having said all that, the way that we look at security and we measure the \u2013 our success in security is through the integration of security in our strategic solutions. We believe that more and more of our AI-driven enterprise solutions that we sell to our customers will have an embedded security component. We're starting to see that. We also believe that having strong security capabilities in our data center solution is going to be increasingly important to our customers, and we're also starting to see some of that as well. It's just that we're going to have \u2013 we're going to let \u2013 we need to let some of these sort of transitions, product transitions in particular, from hardware to software play out. Ken Miller : Operator, we'll take two more questions. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is live. Jim Suva : Given your great success, coupled with the increasing backlog A little commentary was made earlier about seasonality. Can you give us a little bit more insights on that? Because I wonder if as we exit 2022, and I know it's early for 2023 given component constraints, does seasonality become less pronounced in 2023, given the orders backlog success you've had in the easing of supply chain? Thank you. Ken Miller : Yeah, it's a great question, Jim. And at this point, I do expect you to see some seasonality, but I think your point is valid. I do think that the degree of seasonality that we see could be lessened a bit. I mean historically, we've seen kind of a mid-teens decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. At this point, it's a little bit too early to call, but I do see a possibility of that being a little lessened on a sequential decline basis, but I do expect there to be some decline and some seasonality to remain in the business from a revenue perspective. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is live. Tal Liani : Great for squeezing me in. Thank you. I have a very high-level question that I want to understand and it relates to something you answered before. So the biggest fear is that as we work off 2023 budgets, there's going to be weakness across the board. It's not company-specific, it's more macro related. And the question I have is just to understand how much visibility you have into the projects, into the spending plans of your customers? 2023 budgets will only be set in the next few months. How much is there involvement on your end? How much is their involvement in the future planning? I'm just trying to assess the risk of a surprise, negative surprise because of macro, nothing specific. Rami Rahim : Yes. So it's a good question, Tal. I would say our visibility is very strong. I mean first year, the visibility that comes with the backlog. These are orders that have been made for existing projects, then there's a visibility that comes from having very strong strategic conversations with our customers, especially large customers, hyperscalers, large enterprise and service providers. And there, again, I'd say the visibility is great. The only risk would be if the -- things would change in plans that we understand today were to actually change. Again, I will say that for the most part, we don't see that happening at this point in time, but we have to, of course, stay very close to our customers to see if, in fact, things start to change. And I will reiterate here there are deliberate things that we're doing that are designed to make us more resilient in the event that there is a downturn, the diversification of our business, the competitiveness of our solutions. Even if you look in the enterprise, we've really re-honed our go-to-market muscle on enterprise sub-segments that we believe will be more recession resilient. So healthcare, college campuses, public sector would be examples of areas that I think would be less prone to a downturn, and we're making those changes and adjustments now just to prepare. End of Q&A: Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, you may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.  Today's call contains -- these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties -- in 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 results. We delivered record revenue during the fourth quarter, although total sales of $1.449 billion were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some logistical challenges at the end of the quarter.  Despite these challenges, we achieved a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. A record performance by our Enterprise business and our second highest Cloud revenue quarter.  Our non-GAAP gross and operating margin also exceeded expectations resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance.  Our Q4 results capped a record revenue year for Juniper in 2022, which saw us accelerate our growth despite the challenged global supply chain environment. The diversity of our strength was also a highlight during the year as we grew our Enterprise business by more than 20% year-over-year. We grew our Cloud business by more than 13% year-over-year, and we grew our Service Provider business by approximately 3% year-over-year with the revenue growth for each of these verticals, exceeding the high end of our long-term model. I believe these results speak to the strong execution by our teams, the strength of our portfolio and our ability to win across each of the customer verticals and use cases where we compete.  While revenue growth was healthy in Q4 and for the full year of 2022, as we expected, overall demand moderated in the December quarter, with total orders declining more than 20% year-over-year. Although our Enterprise orders were flat year-over-year despite a very difficult comp.  This moderation in total orders was primarily driven by a normalization of buying patterns amongst our Cloud and Service Provider customers. This follows a year in which many of these accounts placed multiple quarters of demand in advance of knowing requirements to account for extended lead times. Now that many of these orders placed in prior periods are shipping and with significant orders on the books for the upcoming year, Cloud and Service Provider customers are placing fewer new orders which is a trend we expect to continue through at least the first half of the current year.  As this order normalization process continues, we think revenue growth will be the most important metric to gauge customer demand over the next several quarters. I'd like to acknowledge that we are seeing some customers across each of our customer verticals, more closely scrutinize spending plans and deployment time lines due to the economic uncertainties that are happening around the world.  Order cancellations continue to remain low and our customers' appetite to receive orders that were placed in prior periods remains high. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to monetize our backlog as supply improves. That said, we're watching these strengths closely and have factored the certainties into our financial outlook.  Despite these current macro uncertainties, I remain optimistic regarding our prospects for the upcoming year. Five reasons driving my optimism include : First, our focus on leveraging AI-driven cloud-based automation tools to simplify customer operations and improve the end user experience. What we call Experience First Networking continues to resonate across the customer verticals we serve, whether it be Mist in the campus to Apstra in the data center to Juniper Paragon in the service provider market, these software automation tools are enabling customers to achieve superior scale cost effectively to rapidly identify and remediate network problems in many cases, without the need for human intervention and to accelerate the time line for network deployments.  These capabilities deliver tangible value to customers which is enabling us to win in the current market environment and may resonate even more if return on investment plays an increasingly important role in customer decisions. Given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I remain optimistic regarding our ability to grow revenue even in a more challenged macro environment. Second, we continue to invest in our go-to-market organization to capitalize on our product differentiation and take share, particularly in the enterprise. To this point, since the beginning of 2019, we have steadily increased our quota carrying headcount, meaningfully increased our channel presence and invested in both demand generation and modern selling tools that are creating more effect and more wind in the market. While these investments have enabled us to accelerate our growth over the last several years, particularly in the enterprise vertical, they are also continuing to provide tailwinds with deal registration from the channel growing 18% year-over-year and order momentum in the commercial market growing 43% year-over-year in the Q4 time frame. We expect this momentum to continue and further benefit growth in future periods. Third, we continue to see strong 400-gig progress with more than 100 new wins across wide area and data center use cases since our last quarterly update. Many of these wins constitute franchises that are likely to present tailwinds for revenue over a multiyear period. While 400-gig solutions are critical to enabling customers to meet the continuous growth in the network bandwidth, they are also critical for improving the power efficiency and cost of operating network, which we think is likely to add resilience to these important projects.  Fourth, we continue to make progress transitioning our business to a more software-centric model. This includes transforming more of our perpetual offerings to term-based licenses, introducing more ratable subscription offerings and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack. While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced encouraging momentum in the Q4 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grew 26% year-over-year and accounts for 21% of our total sales.  Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 43% year-over-year due to strong demand for Mist and certain security subscriptions.  We are encouraged by the progress we are making in our software transformation strategy as many of these revenue streams are recurring, pull-through infrastructure and improve margin.  Finally, we exited 2022 with an exceptional backlog of more than $2 billion, which is up approximately $200 million from where we entered the year and remains well above historical levels. This backlog is providing us with exceptional revenue visibility and should enable us to deliver another year of healthy growth. Based on our current backlog, customer demand and our assumptions regarding supply, we currently expect to deliver at least 8% revenue growth and at least a point of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. Our expectations for 2023 assumes the availability of supply only modestly improves and that the end market environment remains uncertain.  Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions.  This business experienced revenue weakness during the fourth quarter due to the timing of supply following very strong shipments during the prior quarter. That said, our automated WAN business grew 12% on a full year basis, which exceeded our expectations and the high-end of our long-term model.  We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our automated win business based on the momentum we're seeing for several of our newer products. To this point, our new 306-based MX 304 and LC 9600 line card continued to perform exceptionally well; with the MX 304 securing 150 new logos in Q4 and emerging as one of our fastest ramping products over the last five years. Our PTX portfolio also continues to perform well across Cloud, Service Provider and Enterprise accounts. In Q4, our PTX platform secured more than 15 new use case wins that we expect collectively will drive more than $200 million of incremental opportunity over the next three to five years. Not to be overlooked, we're continuing to make progress with our new cloud metro portfolio, which saw orders more than double on a year-over-year basis. Our pipeline of opportunities is strong, and we remain encouraged by our ability to win in the market, especially as we add new AI-driven cloud-based automation capabilities to the portfolio over the next few quarters.  Our cloud-ready data center revenue experienced an exceptional performance in Q4 and grew more than 20% on a full year basis. 400-gig momentum remains strong, and we now have more than 120 400-gig data center wins that include Cloud majors, large Enterprise and Service Provider accounts.  Our Apstra pipeline continues to build as new logos increased meaningfully on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and we experienced strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software. Interest in our new Apstra freeform capability, which provides more flexible deployment options and expands the list of potential customers we can address is encouraging, and we plan to introduce new software capabilities that will further expand the use cases we can address in 2023.  Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains healthy. And given the wins we've already secured, I'm optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years.  Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to significantly outpace the market, growing more than 30% year-over-year in Q4 and 24% on a full year basis. This strength was led by our mid-to five business, which is the segment of our campus and branch portfolio driven by Mist AI and the cloud. This area saw both revenue and orders grew more than 50% year-over-year, with record sales of AI-driven WiFi and EX switching in the Q4 time frame.  On a full year basis, our Mistified revenue was $500 million in 2022, which was up from approximately $300 million in 2021. Our Mistified orders also continued to see strong momentum with fourth quarter results surpassing $900 million on an annualized basis. The industry is clearly recognizing the differentiation of Juniper's campus and branch offerings, driven by Mist AI. We believe this is reflected in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure that was released in December of 2022 where Juniper was named a leader for a third consecutive year and was ranked highest in both completeness of vision and ability to execute for a second consecutive year. Additionally, the Gartner Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure critical capabilities report that was published in January 2023, Juniper received the top score in four out of five of the use cases.  On the product side, we continue to invest heavily in new key areas that drive real value to customers and partners, including WiFi 60 and new AI-driven EX switch variants such as the 41 Hybrid both of which are seeing strong early adoption in the market.  We're also continuing to make enhancements to Marvis, the industry's only virtual network assistance driven by Mist AI. Lastly, customer traction for the AI-driven enterprise remains exceptionally strong. For example, we saw a nearly 80% increase in the number of accounts purchasing at least two Mistified products during the most recent year. This highlights the attractiveness of a full stacked Juniper offering managed via common AI engine and cloud as well as the land and expand opportunities available to our sellers and partners, which we believe remains in the early innings.  Our security revenue returned to growth in Q4, although we expect this business to be pressured over the next few quarters as we transition from an appliance to a ratable software subscription model. We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our security business as we believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused.  We're also encouraged by the interest in our software security offerings, most notably our Security Director cloud platform. This product provides customers a single policy framework to manage all their firewalls, whether in the data center or at the edge or whether on-premises or in the cloud, which is essential to help customers migrate to Zero Trust and SASE architecture. This platform was recently named CRN Magazine's Edge Platform of the Year and already has secured more than 300 wins, which we view as an encouraging sign of future success.  I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another record quarter, and our Services business continued to grow year-over-year due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as the growth of our SaaS business.  Our customer satisfaction scores remain at all-time highs, and our service margins came in better than expected due to higher revenue and lower costs. On a full year basis, our service margins achieved a new all-time record of 67.3%, up 150 basis points as compared to the prior year.  Our Services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud-delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and customer experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss the quarterly and full year financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results, then cover our fiscal year 2022 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.449 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. This was below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some of the logistical challenges towards the end of the quarter. Despite the slight revenue shortfall, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 and which was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by a better-than-expected gross margin result and prudent operating expense management.  In terms of product orders, as expected, we saw a decline due to buying patterns normalizing and customers consuming previously placed orders. This was more pronounced with our Cloud and Service Provider customers. We expect this dynamic to continue as supply improves and backlog normalizes.  During the fourth quarter, total product orders declined more than 20% year-over-year. Adjusted orders placed to accommodate for the extended lead times, declined single digits year-over-year versus a difficult comparison, but grew sequentially. Our adjusted orders calculation only includes a one-way adjustment to reduce bookings due to accelerated ordering.  During the entire time that we've reported adjusted orders, we have not added those orders back into future periods where they would have normally been placed. We believe that if we were to add back those accelerated orders, adjusted orders would have grown in Q4 of 2022.  We exited 2022 with backlog of slightly more than $2 billion, which is down sequentially but up approximately $200 million on a year-over-year basis.  Looking at our revenue by vertical. Enterprise had record revenue and was our largest vertical in the fourth quarter. increasing 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Cloud grew 14% year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially. Service Provider declined 8% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  From a customer solutions perspective, AI-Driven Enterprise revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Cloud-ready data center grew 50% year-over-year and 13% sequentially and automated WAN solutions revenue was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  The total software and related services revenue was $305 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 43% year-over-year, and we exited the year with $294 million in ARR. Total security revenue was $169 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially.  In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, 3 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 34% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5% in the quarter, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by the favorable software mix and to a lesser extent, some improvement in transitory supply chain costs which more than offset an unfavorable product mix. Supply chain continues to be constrained with long lead times and elevated costs. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%.  Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially, primarily due to headcount-related costs. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.2 billion.  Cash flow from operations was $120 million for the quarter. Turning to capital return. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. We also repurchased $88 million worth of shares in the quarter.  Moving on to our full year results. Our revenue for 2022 was a record, coming in at $5.301 billion, which is 12% growth versus 2021. Despite the impact of supply chain constraints, we saw growth across all verticals, customer solutions and geographies.  Our Enterprise business became our largest vertical and grew 21%. Our Cloud business grew 13%, while Service Provider grew 3% year-over-year. From a customer solutions perspective, AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 24% and Cloud-ready data center revenue grew 21% and automated WAN solutions revenue grew 12% on a full year basis.  Total software and related services revenue was $994 million, which was an increase of 31% year-over-year. This exceeded our expectations as we continue to make meaningful progress in transitioning our business to more of a software and SaaS-centric model.  Total security revenue was $629 million, which was down 4% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total 2022 revenue as compared to 31% in 2021.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.4%, a decline of 230 basis points versus 2021, primarily due to the product mix and increased supply chain costs. If not for elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60% in 2022.  Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to higher headcount-related costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95 in 2022, an increase of 12% versus 2021. During 2022, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and paid $270 million in dividends.  I am very pleased with our financial performance, both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website.  At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect first quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, which is 15% growth year-over-year. We are still experiencing supply chain-related headwinds associated with shortages as well as elevated components and freight costs, which are expected to modestly improve through the course of 2023.  First quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be down sequentially to 57% due to a normalized software mix and seasonality. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily driven by the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs. Despite these increases, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase more than 100 basis points versus Q1 2022.  Turning to our expectations for the full year 2023. Given the ongoing customer demand for product, solid exiting backlog and improved supply, we're updating our revenue growth expectations for 2023 from at least 7% to at least 8%. Beyond the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to grow sequentially throughout the course of the year. This assumes the current supply chain environment modestly improves but remains challenged. This forecast as soon as we reduced backlog during the course of the year. However, we expect to exit the year with elevated backlog compared to historical normal levels. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand by at least 100 basis points versus 2022.  That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow double digits on a full year basis. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.  In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : Yes, just a two-parter on the orders, if I could. Maybe, Rami start with you. You're obviously coming up tough compares in a strange environment with the multi-quarter ordering. Is your view that the Service Provider and Cloud customers are going to, over this period, over the next six months or so, be well below trend line and kind of ordering well under consumption? Or is it just something that works out over time? And then maybe, Ken, if you could just give us a little more on the math here. I think if it was $2.3 billion or so last quarter for backlog and a little over $2 billion this quarter, implies a lot more than a 20% decline. So is there something else in the order backlog math there that we're missing? Rami Rahim : Tim. Okay, I'll start, and then Ken, I'll pass it on to you. So what we saw from an order standpoint in Q4 is pretty much expected. Yes, the compares are getting very difficult. A year ago period, definitely Service Providers and Cloud providers were placing orders for multiple quarters in order to get ahead of supply constraints. Enterprise is a little bit of a different story. We actually saw flattish type order momentum on a year-over-year basis in Q4, but that was off of a very difficult compare in the Enterprise segment, where a year ago period in Q4, this would be in '21, orders grew over 40% year-over-year.  So looking forward to your question, I do think there will be for the next at least couple of quarters, a re-normalization of order patterns for Service Providers and Cloud providers as they consume orders that were placed a year ago period and in the Enterprise, I actually think that order momentum will continue. I think if I look at it to 2023, we should continue to see solid Enterprise growth, both from an order standpoint as well as from a revenue standpoint. Ken Miller : Yes. And I think it's worth reiterating, even though I made a comment in my prepared remarks that when we talk about adjusted orders, which were down for the first time on a year-over-year basis, but up sequentially, we really are just doing that one-way adjustment that I referred to. So if you were to normalize and add back those accelerated orders in the proper period, if you will, some of that would have been added back to the last quarter, Q4 '22, and we believe it would have actually shown growth, had we made those adjustments on both sides of the equation, we only did the takeaway side. So I want to make sure that's clear to folks.  From a backlog perspective, I mean, the math really is -- the primary driver of why the backlog decline was orders being down greater than 20% on a gross order basis. We also did see some growth in revenue as well as growth in deferred revenue that I would point to that some of the backlog doesn't get recognized immediately, particularly some of the software subscriptions and SaaS business that is in backlog until we actually invoice or execute that delivery which gives to deferred revenue versus revenue. So that growth also has an impact on backlog. Operator : The next question is coming from Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex Henderson : The first question I wanted to ask was on the Services side of the equation. Obviously, there's a clear tie to future services as you ship more product. And with the product sales accelerating, it's hard for us to determine how rapidly that rolls into the income statement.  So I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity around what you think Services revenues are going to do in the first quarter kind of growth and for the year, what kind of growth might we anticipate there? How much is that contributing to the increase. Ken Miller : Yes, I'll take that one. So we are seeing -- as you mentioned, Alex, the Product revenue does have a direct correlation to our Service revenue opportunity as our installed base gets bigger, given the pretty positive product revenue results of both 2022 and 2021, you are going to see, I believe, that have a positive impact on Services going forward.  So Services is a bit of a lagging indicator. It doesn't -- is not as volatile. Typically, you won't see as large of increases or as large of decreases as product kind of gets a little bit normalized, but trying to convert it to installed base and services. But I would expect our Services business to continue to be strong in 2023 as it has been strong in 2022. And the other thing I would point to is our margin is also quite positive in our Services business. The team has done a great job there. Not only satisfying customers and renewals, et cetera, but also really working down the costs. Alex Henderson : The growth rate accelerated from 4% to 7% to 8%. Is that kind of high single digits, the rate we should be anticipating both in the March quarter and the year? Ken Miller : Yes. We're not giving specific guidance on Services, but I would say, as I mentioned, it is kind of -- it's a lagging unit care, it's not that volatile. So I wouldn't expect significant step function changes anytime soon. That said, maintenance business is the vast majority, but there also is a software element which is our SaaS element, which has been a big part of the growth of our services business over the last few years as more of our software revenue is getting recognized in the form of SaaS revenue. Alex Henderson : Okay. The second question I wanted to ask is you had a very significant increase in the cloud-ready data center year-over-year in the fourth quarter. That looks like it's somewhat of a spike versus a decline in the year ago, but nonetheless, a significant increase. Is that a function of that segment getting more of the available supply? What's the reasoning for that? Rami Rahim : Yes. Alex, I'll take that one. So obviously, very pleased with our cloud-ready data center momentum and success that we saw in Q4 time frame. Over the last several quarters, we did highlight a couple of meaningful wins, one in particular, in a Top 10 cloud provider that was a data center win. So this would be a part of our CRDC business and the solutions that we're developing in that business. So whereas in prior quarters, that was sort of shown in terms of orders, now we're actually starting to see the revenue contribution. There are other elements as well. I think our focus on software-led data center sales in much the same way as we've seen Mist lead to success in the AI-driven enterprise. Cloud-ready data center is still in the earlier phases of that growth period, but we're starting to see a pickup in Apstra-led type opportunities where the net new logos and the sort of the strategic nature of those logos are actually starting to contribute nicely as well. I would not expect this kind of cloud-ready data center performance on an ongoing basis, but again, I do think that I'm optimistic about the overall growth prospects for this business. Operator : The next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I guess I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the composition of the growth this year. You said at least 8% revenue growth and I know if we look back, you guys have instituted some price increases, I think Q3 included. But how much of that 8% plus growth do you think really comes from pricing versus units? How do you think about it? Ken Miller : Yes. So pricing is factored in, obviously, to our outlook. And the way I would describe it, George, is we expect the majority of that 8% to be volume based. There is definitely a pricing element, but it would be less than half, assuming we did revenue at 8%. Obviously, as we grow, if we were able to grow faster than eight, we did put 8% out there was a bit of a floor, but we talked about at least 8%. The majority of that incremental would also be volume related. George Notter : Got it. And then as I think about the unit volume piece. Is that really driven by new products, Mistified or ACX or some of the other new initiatives you've got? Or do you think it's -- what's the dynamic between sort of existing versus new products? Ken Miller : Yes. We're not giving too much detail on exactly the composition of 2023. But I would say this, though. I mean, I think the relative growth that we've outlined in our long-term model and actually that we've delivered for the last couple of years. So if you look at it by vertical, I would expect Enterprise to be our fastest-growing vertical and the products associated with Enterprise are predominantly AIDE and campus and branch, as well as some of our CRDC products. Then you could follow that by Cloud, which is predominantly routing and data center switching and then followed by Service Provider would be our slowest-growing vertical. So I do think relative mix of our products and the mix of our verticals from a growth rate perspective is likely to play out similarly in 2023. But at this point, it's a little bit too early to call the exact components of revenue growth. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess my question was going to be about Service Provider revenues and if you could give us some more color there. It was down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And Rami, I think in your script, you mentioned sort of revenue is going to be the driver or sort of the metric to judge sort of demand from. So what are you seeing in relation to sort of demand from that vertical? You mentioned scrutiny from customers. So are telco customers scrutinizing budgets a bit more than the other verticals? And how should we think of the CapEx positions impacting you here over the sort of next 12 months? Rami Rahim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So what we saw in Q4 was mostly, if not entirely a function of supply. And that's not totally unusual to see this kind of a pullback after a very strong quarter. And if you recall, Q3 was actually a great quarter for Service Provider because we happen to be able to ship quite a large volume of products that was required that was on our balance sheet and also new orders that came in, in the quarter.  So -- but there's more that's happening in the Service Provider segment. First, we're monitoring closely new products that we have introduced over the last, let's say, a year or a couple of years or so. and we're seeing some really strong pickup, which I think gives us confidence in the next few years, if you will, in terms of the dynamics for this segment.  The MX 304 is the fastest-growing product in the last five years, the PTX product family, which really goes to the heart of the 400-gig opportunities that are out there is performing really well as well. I just finished answering questions about the cloud-ready data center. One of the things that's actually driving momentum in our CRDC solutions is the fact that there is a strong diversity of interest among all of our segments especially including Service Providers that are moving to more of a virtualized approach to delivering the kind of services that we're delivering in the past. So there's a number of elements of this business that I think are positive for us long term. In the short term, we're going to get through this normalization of order patterns to revenue, as we just discussed. But long term, being in line with our long-term model, minus two to plus two or even better is definitely possible. Operator : The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : I had two questions. When you talk about 8%, you're using the words at least versus prior, I believe the word you would use is floor. Is it -- should we assume 8% is the floor of growth for 2023? So that's the first question. And then the other question is of the product orders that were submitted in 4Q of '22, how much of the growth was driven by price increases versus volume just so we can get a better idea on composition of the backlog and how that change in 4Q? Ken Miller : Yes. I'll take both of those questions. So when we do -- the words we use officially is at least 8%. And when I describe it often times, I referred to that as the floor, right, because we're setting a range starting at 8%, and we're not really putting a ceiling on it. That's why I described the at least 8& as the floor. But if not, much confuse you, it's meant to be really -- it's the same guidance.  As far as price versus volume, again, I would say we are definitely getting a benefit from the pricing actions we've taken. It is impacting growth, but it is the minority of our growth, right? And the vast majority of our growth is tied to volume sales and quite honestly, taking shares in some of those markets that we're absolutely taking share and such as AI-driven enterprise in the campus branch base and I think we had a very strong quarter in data center as well. So I do prescribed our growth to the success and execution of the team much more than I do the pricing actions we've taken. Operator : Okay. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to get a better sense of the trends coming from Service Providers in that. It sounds like you're blaming this quarter's relative weakness on supply chain, but there's been some others exposed to that vertical that have talked about. Inventory absorption and some of the operators slowing down either in the fourth quarter or first half of '23 as they maybe manage their own cash flow or manage their inventory of gear. I'm presuming that your customers haven't been able to stockpile your equipment and warehouses and don't have that inventory issue for you in the first half of '23. But I just want to get a sense directly from you if that's a factor of what's going on here or whether it's really concentrated around component shortages. Rami Rahim : Let me start, and then, Ken, you might want to weigh in as well. So are there macro sort of challenges weighing in on the Service Provider segment. As I said in my prepared remarks, there are definitely customers across all segments, including in Service Providers that are, let's just say, scrutinizing orders a bit more, looking at time lines for projects, making sure that they're spending as efficiently as possible. So that is happening without a doubt. Having said that, our outlook, our long-term model for Service Provider is a minus two to sort of plus two range. We've managed to exceed that over the last couple of years. I actually think we can still, even with these sorts of macro challenges that are -- that we're seeing out there, maintain that sort of long-term range. Just based on some of these factors that I just mentioned in answering the prior question, right, there are still 400-gig projects that are out there that remain exceptionally important for Service Providers in order to keep ahead of their demand pattern in their networks.  Metro opportunities are definitely still there. The need to carry an increased amount of 5G traffic in fiber optic networks. The need for highly automated Metro solutions continues to be there, and this is a net new market opportunity for us. So net-net, I actually am long term, quite optimistic about this segment despite some of the macro concerns that might be out there? Ken Miller : The only thing I would add is as I've said before, any 90-day period, you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness Q-to-Q based on either vertical cuts or customer solution cuts. That really is a factor of inventory and supply and what we're able to ship in any given quarter. I think a longer-term view of FY '22 was more indicative of what our Service Provider business is doing, and we did post 3% growth, as Rami mentioned, above our model. So I feel good about the space overall. Based on the customers conversations we've had and the supply constraints, quite honestly, that we've had over the last few quarters, we do not believe customers are sitting on excess at inventory levels. It's not something that we're particularly worried about at this point. They clearly are able to not book as much as they did prior because they're no longer accelerating orders and are actually -- we're actually delivering the orders they booked previously. So the bookings is getting impacted. But from a revenue perspective, we're not seeing that impact. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : You guys were pretty clear, I think, on all the puts and takes in '23, but I wanted to ask a question about normalization. And so if you think about your order growth pattern over the last couple of years, it's been incredibly strong, but your backlog exiting 2020 was roughly about $400 million, and your business is about 20% bigger today. So when we start to think about what normalized order growth rates look like and backlog looks like, how should we think about where backlog should be relative to where you were, let's say, two years ago or 2.5 years ago and your desire to obviously build some buffer stock to meet customer demand. Should we expect backlog to be a normalized period sort of commensurate with sort of the ratios that we've seen in the past? Or should we expect a slightly higher uptick in the backlog going forward when things normalize? Ken Miller : Yes. It's a really good question. And quite honestly, if something, I don't have a perfect answer to you, but I'll let you know what I expect to happen. So I absolutely expect backlog to start to normalize, and I expect us to -- backlog to reduce in 2023. I still expect that we'll exit the year with what I refer to as elevated backlog. I don't exactly have the number for you, but I do think we'll exit the year elevated. So it will start to reduce, but remain elevated, would be my expectation. And what the new normal is hard to say.  And as you mentioned, historically, we've been in that kind of $400 million to $450 million range for quite some time. I would like to think that the new normal is going to be greater than that, maybe closer to somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion as I think customers understand the value of giving us orders a little bit earlier, giving us a little longer lead times to react. I'm hoping that the new normal is a little less frantic as it was just a few years ago when we were starting the quarter with not enough backlog. So I feel good about our backlog position, obviously, the variability of it. I think it will decline throughout 2023 but remain elevated and work finally settled a couple of years from now, it's hard to predict, but I would like to speak more than where we were in that 400-level. Operator : The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess the first one I had was when you put talked about the order trajectory, you talked about auto going down on Service Provider and Cloud side, but they've be running to be flattish on the Enterprise side. I was wondering if you can talk about why are you seeing such a deviation in auto trends between those 3 buckets? And on the Enterprise side, is it flat because you're picking up share? What's to the better performance there versus other 2. Rami Rahim : Yes, I'll start. So SP and Cloud, primarily because of the fact a year ago period and before that, they were just doing more ordering for multiple quarters to get ahead of the supply constraints that we were facing. And I think it's not unusual because typically the kinds of projects that SPs and Clouds are engaging and tend to be just very strategic, very large. They require a lot of upfront planning and for that reason, that early ordering was just happening in more abundance. It also did happen in the Enterprise just not to that same extent.  I think the second part of your question is about sort of the order momentum we're seeing in the Enterprise and why. I think we're just executing exceptionally well on the Enterprise across the board, pretty much every solution area, whether it be data center, are, of course, our AI-driven enterprise solution, even in the WAN, we had a great federal government quarter, for example, we're sort of firing on all cylinders. Our competitive differentiation and our solutions, especially in our AI-driven enterprise solution continues to work really well for us. And for that reason, Enterprise is now Juniper's is the largest segment. A few years ago, there was actually some doubt about whether Juniper can win or succeed in the Enterprise, and I think those doubts are pretty much behind us at this point. Ken Miller : The only thing I would add is we've had a lot of momentum in Enterprise for the last several years, and we actually expect 2023 to be a growth year for Enterprise, both from a bookings, order perspective as well as a revenue perspective and I know we aren't naive to some of the macro conditions out there. But given the product differentiation we have, kind of the market share we have, the opportunity in front of us, we feel pretty confident we can continue to grow the enterprise in 2023 despite kind of some of the macro conditions. Operator : The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have two questions on -- related to the backlog. If the backlog is down $300 million or $250 million in Q4. Do you -- and we are entering into a year that is supposed to be tougher for spending because it's really only -- really only starts this year. Does it mean that the backlog declines could accelerate this year on a sequential basis, dollar basis, et cetera? That's the first question.  And the second question is how should I think about the adjustment of backlog? I'm trying to think about what could the growth rate be after the backlog is adjusted down if the order -- if the environment is not changing. So when I look at the sequential basis of 4Q, last year, it was up 10% roughly. And this year, if I remove this quarter, if I remove the backlog, there is a 25% delta between the growth you had last year and the growth you have this year because without the backlog, you were down 15% instead of being up 10%.  So the question is, is the order environment deteriorate that much between 3Q and 4Q? And then how does it carry on to 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, when the year progresses and the spending environment worsened in some sense. So again, my question is more about understanding how could the environment look like once you consume the backlog if the order environment doesn't change much. Ken Miller : Yes. So let me start with that. So from a backlog perspective, we did see a decline in the fourth quarter, as you noted, sequentially. However, I think it's important to note, backlog was up approximately $200 million year-on-year, right? So for the full year, we had a pretty strong bookings year and actually grew backlog, but you are starting to see that decline and you're starting to see orders, I would say, normalized, but actually, that's really not the right way to say it. Customers have already placed orders, and we are now shipping those orders. So actually orders are understated, if you will, the true demand whereas the past 3 quarters, orders have been overstating through demand because they've been accelerating orders to account for multiple periods of time to adjust the lead times, now kind of the opposite is happening. And as I mentioned, we're not adding that back in.  So the bookings number is going to be very unusual, I believe. This like it has been on the positive side. I think you're going to see something similar on the negative side going over the next couple of quarters, which is why we think revenue is really the best demand metric you have. And backlog will come down, we haven't stated exactly how much and the timing of it, it really does depend on our ability to capture supply, which is uncertain at this point, but we do expect it to come down throughout 2023, but remain high as we exit the year as customers are basically consuming orders we've already received.  So I look at it as kind of a burden hand better than two in the bush scenario, where we already have the orders that really is the demand for 2023 in-house. And as we shift that it's going to play havoc on growth rates for current period orders. Rami Rahim : And I'll just add on this. I think Ken summarized the situation for Q4 really well. Orders that we would have otherwise received in Q4, we already had them in hand because of customers that were early ordering, especially in SP and Cloud.  As we look at it to 2023, orders don't need to grow in order for us to hit the at least 8% in revenue growth for the year. But I actually think they can grow. And in the Enterprise, I believe they will grow. Operator : Okay. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Rami, for you, a big topic that's coming up is AI workloads. Is there a way to think about the opportunity -- or is that going to be out throughout the course of the year? Thanks. Rami Rahim : 2022 and I think it's a demonstration -- that drive market share taking for our Enterprise business, and that -- our Paragon automation for the metro within the Service Provider debate. Now having said that, I think your question is more around cloud providers and the opportunity that AI presents to us in terms of supplying the infrastructure necessary to keep up with demand. And earlier in this call, I mentioned how long term, I'm actually quite bullish about long-term cloudified businesses. And one of the reasons is because of AI. I believe that this is going to be yet another big initiative or a catalyst to increase traffic within the data centers and in the WAN leading or ending in their data centers among all cloud providers that they will have to get ahead of. And they get ahead of that by building higher performance, more cost effective, more cost-efficient networks, both within the data centers and in the wide area network. We will benefit from that because of the existing footprint that we already have within the cloud space -- as you know, we're in pretty much all of the major cloud providers, hyperscale and the top 10 cloud providers as well.  Add to that the new 400-gig opportunities that become exceptionally important to carry all this traffic cost effectively. And I think it bodes well for our cloud provider business in the long run. Ken Miller : Yes. And to your second question, so from a backlog perspective, we believe our backlog remains extremely durable. Level of cancellations remain extremely low compared to the backlog levels, and I expect that cancellation level to remain low going forward. From a Q4 kind of timing of revenue mix perspective, you're right in that the Q4 miss basically made -- we made that up in Q1. So it really was a timing thing. We had a few more days. We would have made the quarter's expectation, but that rate did slip into Q1. We've already made that up. You can see that reflected in the Q1 guide of $13.40 which lower sequential than we normally see from a Q4 to Q1. So I believe that has been made up.  And other thing I'd mention is on the Q4 margin, which wasn't asked about, we did see some favorableness in the Q4 margin. Some of that is due to software mix and quite honestly, some of that's because we couldn't ship some of the hardware we were expecting to ship, which was at a lower margin. So that also has an impact on Q1 guidance where you're seeing margin come down seasonally a little more than normal off of Q4. It always -- it normally comes down, it comes down a little more to that software mix and as it relates to margin in 2023, I do think there's opportunity for margin to be flat to modestly up. I do expect there to be some improvement in some of those expedite fees and freight costs. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty with gross margin, and I feel that the street models as they are, the expectations there currently has, I would encourage you to keep those as they are for 2023. Operator, we'll take two more questions. Operator : The next question is coming from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jake on for Aaron. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the momentum you're seeing in 400G and any changes in the competitive landscape there? Rami Rahim : Yes, I'd be happy to. So for 400-gig there's been 100 new wins between Service Providers and Cloud providers since our last update, which was a quarter ago. In terms of competitive landscape, it's always been a competitive environment. I believe that we have real strength, experience and know-how, especially in the WAN for service providers and hyperscale cloud providers where we can leverage our existing footprint in order to basically understand the specific feature by feature requirements and do sort of incremental upgrades to 400 gig.  But we're actually also seeing some really promising success, if you will, in the cloud-ready data center space, and they basically inside the data center switching fabric with 120 cumulative total 400-gig data center wins now and I do believe that we're in the early innings right now. I get this question quite a bit, where I know it feels like we've been talking about the 400-gig opportunity for a while. But actually, it's still early periods because there's sort of this time period in the early part of any new Ethernet speed inflection point that starts with the introduction of optics, the optics have to become cost-effective. Then the project need to actually start to kick in. There's a testing period and there is a deployment period. I actually think that we're sort of right now in the early stages of that growth, and I do believe that it's going to be a wonderful opportunity for us, especially in SP and Cloud. Operator : This completes the -- absolutely. Last question is coming from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Fahad Najam : I hate to go back to the topic of order normalization. Can you maybe help us maybe add a dimension of where lead times are? And should we expect as lead times now, customers will place orders as they normalize. Any indication on how lead times are trending? And then I have another question on what you're seeing on the broader market in terms of demand trends. You cited some macroeconomic challenges. Is it more pertaining to site segments like high tech or is it more broad? Any color there would be also very helpful. Rami Rahim : Let me start with the second part, and then I'll hand it over to you, Ken, for the first part. When we say some uncertainty that's out there, it's really more in conversations we're having with customers, the scrutiny that they're placing on budgets. There have been some, a few project push-outs, no cancellations really. But despite that, I think that there are plenty of reasons for us to be optimistic. The strategic importance of the network, digital transformation projects, the 400-gig opportunity that I just talked about, our Enterprise momentum that I think, in many ways, is unique to Juniper because of the differentiation, especially in artificial intelligence that we have and then the backlog that we're sitting on. Ken? Ken Miller : Yes, from a lead time perspective, it's hard to get specific because the reality is all products have different lead times. But the range really is from 30 days to upwards of 9 months, even 12 months in some cases. One way to look at it would be our overall backlog. If you just went on a FIFO basis, we have roughly two quarters of backlogs. So lead times on average roughly six months as one might look at it and it's down a bit from where we entered the quarter. So we are seeing some improvements there. Jess Lubert : Thank you, everyone, for your time. That concludes today's call. Operator : Thank you, gentlemen. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss our Q1 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the first quarter with total revenue of $1,372 million, growing 17% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Total product sales grew 23% year-over-year and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer solutions and all geographies. Profitability was also strong in Q1 as our non-GAAP gross and operating margin both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, above the high end of our quarterly guidance range. These results reflect healthy customer demand for our solutions as well as the improvements we\u2019re seeing in the availability of supply. Our teams continue to execute extremely well, and we remain confident in our positioning from a technology, go-to-market and supply chain perspective, to capitalize on our customers\u2019 digital transformation and cloudification initiatives that are likely to further increase network requirements over the next several years. As expected, total orders softened during the March quarter, declining more than 30% year-over-year. I do not believe this reflects true underlying demand due to our customers\u2019 consumption that previously placed early orders and the reduced need for new early orders as lead times have improved. With that said, we believe customer ordering patterns are normalizing and we would expect to see a return to more traditional seasonal patterns on a sequential basis starting this quarter. This would imply that our year-over-year order declines should improve on a go-forward basis, and return to year-over-year growth potentially as soon as Q4 of this year. From a vertical basis, I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our enterprise business, which grew nearly 30% year-over-year in Q1 with double-digit revenue growth in both the campus and branch and the data center. We also saw strong momentum in the channel where deal registration grew by more than 30% year-over-year, and in the commercial market, where orders grew by 40% year-over-year. As of the March quarter, the Enterprise accounted for more than 40% of our total revenue and represented both our largest and our fastest-growing vertical for a second consecutive quarter. Our Enterprise campus and branch business performed exceptionally well in Q1 with revenue growing nearly 50% year-over-year. Our customers are clearly recognizing the value of our cloud-native AI-driven architecture, which helps them optimize user experiences from client to cloud and minimize operating costs through proactive automation. Revenue from the Mistified segment of our business, which is defined as products driven by Mist AI grew by nearly 60% year-over-year in the Q1 time frame with new logos increasing by nearly 30% year-over-year. Wi-Fi momentum continues to outpace the market and we are seeing record pull-through of wired switching as well as increased attach of our AI-driven SD-WAN offerings. Important wins this quarter included a top-tier U.S. bank, one of the largest U.S. retailers, a leading global logistics provider and a top pharmaceutical company just to name a few. Not to be overlooked, our Apstra pipeline continued to build as new logos more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and we experienced strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which we view as a positive indicator for our Enterprise data center prospects. Given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow both Enterprise revenue and orders during the year even in a more challenged macro environment. Our service provider business also performed well in Q1 due in large part to the timing of supply which enabled us to fulfill prior orders with some of our larger Tier 1 Service Provider customers, particularly for our MX and PTX platforms. While revenue with these customers is likely to remain lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I\u2019m optimistic about our ability to grow this business during the year based on the momentum we\u2019re seeing around customer 400-gig wins, many of which remain large opportunities in the early stages of deployment. We also continued to see strong early interest in our cloud metro portfolio, led by our Paragon automation suite. In fact, our ACX7K platform saw another quarter of triple-digit year-over-year order growth. With further enhancements to this portfolio expected later this year and next, we expect momentum within this business to build through the year and become more material to revenue in 2024 and beyond. I\u2019d like to acknowledge we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals, more closely scrutinizing budgets and project deployment time lines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. While order cancellations continue to remain extremely low, as supply improves, we are seeing more customers reschedule delivery dates to better match current project time line. This is proving to be particularly true in the cloud vertical, where certain customers are digesting prior purchases, and we saw a series of projects pushed to future periods during the March quarter. While these delays may negatively impact our ability to grow our cloud business in the current year, based on the conversations we\u2019ve had with many of these accounts, we\u2019re confident these delays are a function of timing and remain positive regarding our long-term growth outlook in cloud. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and optimistic regarding our ability to navigate market uncertainty. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued Enterprise momentum, the success we\u2019re seeing around Service Provider 400-gig deployments, the ongoing strength of our backlog which remains well above historical levels and the improvements we\u2019re seeing in supply. Longer term, I continue to see attractive growth opportunities in the cloud, while we already maintain a meaningful footprint and remain closely engaged with many of these customers on potential new opportunities both in the wide area and the data center that could present additional growth drivers. Finally, I remain encouraged by the improved diversity of our business which is lessening our sensitivity to any one customer or vertical and enabling us to navigate pockets of weakness in the market by pivoting resources to the greatest areas of opportunities. Based on these dynamics, coupled with our Q1 actuals and expectations for Q2, we are raising our full year revenue outlook and currently expect to deliver at least 9% growth for the year. We continue to remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $1,372 million in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, which is above the guidance range, driven by the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. From a customer solution perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in all areas. AI-driven enterprise led the way with revenue growth of 48%, automated WAN solutions revenue grew 21% and cloud-ready data center revenue increased 3%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 29%, Service Provider increased 28% and Cloud decreased 14%. Total software and related services revenue was $232 million, which was an increase of 2% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $293 million and grew 39% year-over-year. Deferred revenue from our SaaS and software license subscriptions grew 68% year-over-year. We remain confident in our outlook for total software growth and ARR growth. Total security revenue was $182 million, up 13% from the first quarter of last year due to the timing of shipments related to improved supply. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were Service Providers, 4 were Cloud and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 30% of total revenue as compared to 32% in Q1 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.8%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by favorable customer mix and higher revenue volume. While supply has improved for the majority of our products, we continue to experience supply constraints for certain components and supply chain costs remain elevated. If not for those elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 59%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily due to headcount-related costs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 14.8% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, driven by higher revenue and better-than-expected gross margin. As Rami mentioned, bookings were down more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter. As a reminder, in Q1 2022, we were still getting a lot of early orders as customers were dealing with supply constraints and extended lead times. In Q1 2022, our product orders were over $1.1 billion. Now customers are consuming those early orders and are no longer placing early orders as supply constraints have improved and lead times are shortening. This combination is resulting in a year-over-year decline in bookings, which we expect to moderate going forward. Our backlog remains elevated but declined by more than $350 million due to improvements in supply and order patterns normalizing. Due to the continuation of these factors, we expect backlog to further decline in 2023, but remain elevated relative to historical levels exiting the year. Cash flows from operations was $192 million in the quarter. We paid $71 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $140 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $1.2 billion. I\u2019m very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. This is a testament to our team\u2019s dedication and commitment to delivering excellence. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect second quarter revenue of $1,410 million, which is 11% growth year-over-year. Our confidence is driven by the strength of our demand forecast, our elevated backlog and an improved supply outlook. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 58%. We expect second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat sequentially. Turning to our expectations for the rest of 2023. With the order and backlog visibility we have and our current expectations for supply, we are raising our full year revenue guidance from at least 8% to at least 9% growth. This increase in our revenue expectation reflects the Q1 overachievement and the expectations embedded within our Q2 guidance. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to see sequential revenue growth more in line with normal seasonal patterns. However, the degree of seasonality will be impacted by availability of supply and the timing of customer requested delivery dates. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to slightly expand to approximately 58% in 2023. This is above the prior guidance of flat to slightly up versus 57.4% in 2022. However, gross margin results will depend on revenue mix and the future trajectory of supply chain costs. With this in mind, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by greater than 100 basis points on a full year basis. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow double digits on a full year basis. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess the question I really have is around the order decline that you\u2019ve seen of about 30%. It\u2019s obviously notable here. Could you just touch on what do the order trends look like across three segments? I suspect there\u2019s some variance there. And then maybe just related to that, I think the backlog number right now might be around $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. What do you think the normalized level looks like? What is -- the normalized level is for backlog in a post-COVID world? Ken Miller : Yes. So from an order decline perspective, I would want to remind you that it really is about the comparison. So a year ago, we were still receiving a lot of early orders, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a year ago, the orders were over $1.1 billion. Now what\u2019s happening is customers are actually receiving those orders and are no longer placing early orders as lead times are now coming in. So, you\u2019re really seeing last year the orders were actually greater than real demand, if you will. This year, as we normalize, they\u2019re less than what I would say is real demand as they\u2019re leveraging what they already booked and no longer booking early orders. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing those year-on-year declines. From a vertical perspective, we did see a slight decline in Enterprise, a very slight decline there. The majority of the client was in Service Provider and Cloud as those were the ones that were having the more normalization required compared to prior bookings. And I would say, in particular, in Q1, we did see Cloud was our weakest vertical from an orders perspective for some of the reasons that Rami mentioned in his prepared remarks. On the backlog perspective, we definitely expect to exit the year at elevated levels. I would say more than twice what we normally were from a backlog perspective pre-pandemic. So we used to be around $400 million, give or take, a little bit. I expect to exit north of $800 million, more than double normal levels as we close the year out. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : I was hoping you could just dig into the cloud and the push-out there a little bit. Maybe one, just keeping on the orders, as those push out into later periods, what do you think impact that will have on future period orders? And then, anything you could tell us secondly on kind of products or technologies or any other tidbits on why these push-outs are happening? Is it just a straight digestion, do you think it\u2019s happening across the board, or anything more in your pieces of the network with the larger players? Rami Rahim : Yes. Let me take that, Tim. So first, I want to highlight that in Q1, what we saw mostly was a function of our ability to ship products that our customers in the Cloud segment wanted. Your question, I think, is more around sort of the demand dynamics in the Cloud. And on that, I\u2019d say that there definitely is a bit more scrutiny of certain projects. There were some projects that did move out in time. It\u2019s not specific to any one customer. It\u2019s not even specific to the Tier 1 hyperscale cloud provider. I would say it\u2019s a little bit broader than that. Having said all that, I want to emphasize that the projects that we have been engaged in around 400-gig upgrades, for example, data center interconnect, data center fabric, pluggable optics, DR, DR-plus type of use cases remain intact. I mean, I have not seen project cancellations in cloud. I\u2019ve only seen an adjustment in the timing of those projects, which is sort of impacting the demand environment in the Cloud segment. So I expect that that -- sort of that impact to last for the next few quarters, but I do fully expect that it will recover. Ken Miller : Yes. And from a revenue perspective, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Rami said that the quarterly results is largely due to just timing of supply and timing of deployments. We do expect cloud revenue to recover from Q1 levels. I don\u2019t think the Q1 levels for cloud is going to be the new norm. You saw a little bit of a shift from a supply and timing of projects towards Service Provider in Q1 with a large growth in Service Provider. Cloud was down more than expected in Q1. That will normalize as we proceed to burn through the backlog and demand. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Silverstein with TD Cowen. Paul Silverstein : Returning to this issue on customer delays and downsizing if not cancellations. Ken and Rami, hoping -- I was hoping for some more insight, beyond Tim\u2019s question, just focused on Cloud, what are you seeing over time and what are terms of those delays, the increased scrutiny, how severe is it and how does that compare to 90 days ago and how has it trended recently? Rami Rahim : Okay. Paul, thanks. So I\u2019m not sure if I can give you that much more color than I just provided. I\u2019ll say that we started to see some of the delays early in the quarter. Like I said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s specific to any one customer. The most important thing I want to highlight to you all is that I do not believe that this is permanent. So, if it was permanent then the projects that we are engaging in -- when I say engaging in, I mean, in labs, testing specific features, capabilities, 400-gig density, power efficiency, all of these things that matter a lot to our cloud customers are still very much active. They are in motion. And so what we thought in terms of certain ramp for some projects has simply moved out in time. And by how much, it\u2019s sort of difficult to know exactly, but I\u2019d say sort of a few quarters. And I fully expect that the cloud demand environment is going to come back and if not by the end of this year, then next year. Paul Silverstein : Rami, just to be clear, you specifically referenced cloud demand environment. But if we look beyond Cloud to Enterprise and carrier, is it the same comment? Rami Rahim : Okay. Thank you, Paul. I actually didn\u2019t catch that. I thought this was more around Cloud. Paul Silverstein : No, it\u2019s a broader question. Looking at the totality business, including Enterprise and Cloud. Rami Rahim : Okay. So I appreciate that clarification. So let me say a few things about the broader environment. We did mention that customers, IT professionals, CIOs are scrutinizing orders all up. I think that\u2019s a generic statement that really applies across all verticals. Having said that, I feel very good about our enterprise business, about the enterprise demand environment itself in that there are still large strategic projects around digital transformation for which our solutions are very well suited for both in the AI enterprise client to cloud as well as in the data center. And I also feel very good about the fact that we are a very differentiated player in a massive opportunity with relatively modest share. So, the opportunity even in a challenged macro environment for us to see growth in this segment or in this vertical, I should say, is very good, which is why Ken just mentioned that we anticipate that we can grow revenue and orders in our enterprise business for the year. And certainly, I believe beyond that as well. I will then just add to that, in the service provider space, 400-gig projects for core and edge upgrades are also still there. I\u2019m actually feeling quite good about our service provider business for this year. You\u2019re going to -- I don\u2019t think you should expect the same sort of revenue we saw in the Q1 time frame to repeat because that\u2019s very much a timing of -- a function of the timing of supply. But all in all, we\u2019ve beaten our long-term model for the service provider\u2019s vertical for the last two years in a row. And actually, based on current trends, expect to beat it again this year. Paul Silverstein : All right. My follow-up question. I appreciate it\u2019s hard enough forecasting margins in a good environment, I appreciate that much hard in this environment. But the question is, Ken, if you look beyond this year in terms of ever getting back to that 60-plus, 20-plus gross operating margin model. Any thoughts you can share? Presumably, things will improve over time. It will be a more hospitable environment. But any thoughts that you could share as to the longer term trajectory? And one quick clarification. Historically, you were kind enough to give this normalized order number where you made some adjustments. I might have missed -- I didn\u2019t see it in this shareholder letter. Did I just miss it? Ken Miller : Yes. So normalized orders, we talked on the last call that really what we did to create normalized orders or adjusted orders was removed early ordering. Since there are no longer really early ordering happening, in fact, the opposite is happening is they\u2019re consuming previously placed early orders, we are no longer providing orders just because we no longer have customers ordering ahead, right? Lead times are coming in, -- so that phenomenon is no longer necessary. That\u2019s why we stopped disclosing adjusted orders. It\u2019s just not a phenomenon\u2026 Paul Silverstein : I thought you made an adjustment also in the backward looking, but I apologize. Ken Miller : No problem. On the margin perspective, we expect to expand operating margin greater than 100 basis points this year. That is not a one-year phenomenon. I expect to expand operating margin for years to come. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why we won\u2019t get back into the 20-plus operating margin situation in due course. It\u2019s something we\u2019re very focused on as we add leverage to this business as we continue to grow sustainably on the top line perspective, and actually growing expenses lower than revenue and expanding our operating margin leverage for years to come. Gross margin is a little more difficult to predict. I\u2019ll just give you some of the levers. Clearly, volume will help, software will help but we obviously have the headwind of the mix, right, where we are going to be expanding at a faster rate, some of our lower-margin systems which will have a bit of a headwind to overall margin capability. Last but not least, would be some of the normalization and transitory costs that should also give us a lift into the future. So without giving a number, I think there\u2019s opportunity to expand gross margin, but the one I\u2019m really focused on and feel very confident about is expanding operating margin. Operator : Next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Just trying to maybe kind of parse out and Ken, maybe we can go back to the order comment. I know you\u2019re not giving adjusted orders. But what I\u2019m trying to figure out is if I kind of use your signposts from the first quarter of March of last year, just based on the backlog commentary in the release in your commentary, it would suggest sort of order growth rates maybe a little bit below that 30% number that you\u2019re talking about in the release. Just any help there would be great. And then second, when you think about operating margin expansion, obviously, you feel more confident to be able to do at least 100 basis points. Is there anything that you see over the next couple of quarters that sort of limit your visibility? And I\u2019m a little bit surprised that maybe given the strength in the gross margin, you didn\u2019t take that up to something maybe a little bit more than at least 100 basis points. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes. So for the order growth it\u2019s kind of difficult to provide more color. I mean I tried to provide -- I did provide last year\u2019s number of greater than 1.1, and we did decline this year by greater than 30%. So that\u2019s really how the math works. I mean, one thing I will point out that I know some folks models don\u2019t account for is our SaaS business. So our SaaS business shows up in bookings, but does not show up in backlog. It\u2019s only a product backlog number. And since SaaS is a service revenue stream, it is missing from a lot of the model. So that might help you translate kind of your model versus our actual results. On the operating margin question, we haven\u2019t really provided a guide or a target for the year. We\u2019re providing a floor, right, greater than 100 basis points. Yes, I did up the gross margin guide, but there\u2019s still a plus or minus factor there. If we deliver 58% or gross margin, our current estimate is approximately 58%, give or take, that should translate to more than the minimum on the operating margin line of 100. So, we haven\u2019t really provided an operating margin target, just more of a floor of greater than 100. Operator : Next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess on the commentary that you had relative to seeing a more seasonal increase in orders going forward, I just wanted to dive into that a bit. Is that consistent across the three customer verticals, particularly I think in relation to enterprise, I think there\u2019s an impression here that things have deteriorated more recently, particularly given some of the challenges and more recently on the banking or financial services side. Have you seen any of that? Is there a more consistent sort of seasonal improvement across all the verticals? Maybe you can touch on that. And secondly, I think, Ken, for you, in terms of orders getting back to growth in Q4, just wanted to check that. I mean, on my math, you need about sort of a mid-teens improvement from the order levels from Q1 to get back to growth in Q4. I just wanted to check if we sort of are doing the math, right? Rami Rahim : So let me start, Samik. So, in terms of the return to seasonally, it was more of a broad statement around our revenue for the year. I\u2019d say that it definitely applies to our Enterprise and our Service Provider. Cloud provider will depend a little bit on some of the project push-outs that I just highlighted that, I think, again, will be temporary. So that might change things for the next couple of quarters in Cloud. I think you also touched on some of the banking fears, et cetera, and impact of that to the demand environment, and where you would expect it to impact us would be in our enterprise business. And I\u2019ll say that, no, we have not seen anything material or significant to the demand environment for our Enterprise solutions. And in fact, in some ways, I kind of view that the challenges that do exist in macro today is forcing enterprises to take a hard look at digital transformation as a means of creating greater levels of efficiency in their operations by leveraging automation, artificial intelligence, and AI is in fact the biggest element of differentiation in our enterprise solutions. So, it\u2019s creating a bit of a -- somewhat of a positive effect in certain parts of our enterprise business that we\u2019re taking advantage of. Ken Miller : Yes. And on the kind of seasonality of the order rates, I just want to make sure -- we\u2019ve talked about it, but I want to make sure people really understand the Q1 2023 orders were below normal. I mean, I think that\u2019s the best way to think about it. If normal orders were $100 and prior year orders were greater than normal, say, 120, this quarter, they\u2019re below normal, say, 80, just to get back to the normalized true growth of 100. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in Q1 results, which is why you\u2019re seeing the year-on-year decline that we mentioned. I expect orders to get back to closer to normal, closer to that 100 normalization by the end of the year, by Q4. And by the way, Q4 is typically our seasonally our largest quarter. So I do expect sequential growth from here possibly returning to growth by Q4. And those growth rates you\u2019ve mentioned between Q4 and Q1 are absolutely directionally correct. I mean, we expect to see fairly significant growth from this Q1 order level. Operator : The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I\u2019ve got two as well, if I can. I guess, I want to go back to the operating margin trend and the trajectory here. One thing that stands out to me is that it looks like your headcount growth is the highest level sequentially that we\u2019ve seen in quite some time. So I\u2019m curious, I think it was up -- 340 employees sequentially. I\u2019m just curious is there a change going on as far as investing in the headcount? If so, is that sales capacity? Just how do I kind of think about that investment you\u2019re making in headcount and I guess tied back to that operating margin returned back to 20%. Ken Miller : Yes. So headcount is up year-over-year, and there\u2019s really a couple of things happening. One, we\u2019ve been talking about quite a bit, which is we are investing in sales, particularly enterprise sales, as we believe we have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of the product differentiation we have and scale that business and grow much faster than market, which we\u2019ve been doing, obviously, and expect to continue to do for quite some time. So there is an intentional investment in enterprise sales globally. The other thing I would mention is really it\u2019s about -- some of it is about low cost, high cost as we continue to grow predominantly in lower-cost regions. So you\u2019re not seeing the dollars necessarily tied to the headcount growth that you might expect. And the big focus is operating margin leverage. And we\u2019re seeing that. We have been delivering that from a revenue to expense ratio perspective over the last couple of years, and we expect to continue to do that this year. So we are very committed to managing the bottom line and expanding operating margin. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then a quick follow-up. Not asked earlier. Just curious, though, it seems like it\u2019s garnering increased amount of traction with logos up by over 2x year-over-year. The Apstra business, can you help us appreciate the size of that? And again, I guess the real crux of that is the pull-through effect that you\u2019re seeing on the hardware side. Just maybe unpack that a little bit further. Rami Rahim : Yes. We haven\u2019t really broken out that part of the business. But I will say that Apstra for us, the measure of success that matters the most is data center sales -- data center competitive displacements. And what Apstra does is to give us like a sort of a weapon that enables us to do just that because it is truly a unique solution in the market and that it is the only open solution, it\u2019s a truly scalable solution, it\u2019s the first really pioneered the concept of intent-based networking that makes fabric management ongoing operations data center super simple. So from that standpoint, it\u2019s becoming increasingly meaningful. New customer wins are growing meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. And even if the software component of the sale is relatively small, what we\u2019re finding is that the hardware pull-through can actually be quite large. And in those deals, Apstra is the tip of the spear in terms of how we compete effectively. Operator : The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Francis on for Sami Badri. The first question that I had was what is giving you confidence or what type of customer verticals are giving you confidence that product order growth will return to year-on-year growth by 4Q \u201823, considering the recent demand trends from other company reports? Rami Rahim : This really comes down to the customer conversations that we have each and every day in the normal due course of business. The competitiveness and differentiation of our solutions right now, really across the board. Enterprise 400-gig offerings for SP and Cloud, of course, we also have a pipeline of funnel that we scrutinize carefully. All of these factors give us confidence that order patterns should improve from here and could, in fact, result in year-over-year growth by the end of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And one last question. Could you actually walk us through why software and related services only grew 2% and how ARR grew 39%. There\u2019s just a little bit of a difference between those two growth rates. So maybe just a little bit more color between the puts and takes between those two growth rates? Ken Miller : Yes. I think the primary driver there is our perpetual software, which does tend to be lumpy. And we did see a little bit less of that in this particular period than, say, a year ago period. The more ratable software is clearly growing sustainably, but it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s the minority of our overall software business as our on-box Flex model -- Flex licenses is still the lion\u2019s share of our software overall, the fastest-growing piece is the SaaS piece, which is why you\u2019re seeing ARR grow like it did. Operator : The next question comes from George Notter with Jeffries. George Notter : I guess I wanted to ask about your content provider or cloud provider revenue stream and orders, obviously, quite a bit softer here this quarter. It seems like the conditions are here for an inventory correction. Is it possible that you were seeing customers build inventory of your products as your lead times were longer. And now as lead times are shortening their appetite for holding inventory is reduced. And maybe that\u2019s physical inventory, maybe that\u2019s an inventory of excess capacity that\u2019s built in the network. Any sense that that might be going on would be helpful. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Well, I think Ken touched on this, but I think the biggest factor in terms of just the order dynamics, the demand environment is that a year ago, they were placing orders for extended lead times for a year-plus out. Today, if the same cloud provider were to make an order -- and Juniper product, they would not have to wait as long. So the combination of these two things results in them going through a period of digestion. Basically, there is no need for them to place as many orders this quarter Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. I think honestly, that is the simplest way I can say what is happening in the Cloud segment right now. George Notter : I guess the follow-on to that is, do you think that the product you shipped in recent quarters to those customers went into networks, or do you think it went into inventories? Rami Rahim : I don\u2019t have full visibility, to be honest. I mean, I suspect some of it did go into a network, some of it did go into some level of inventory. But the net effect of it is they are going to -- for the next couple of quarters or so going to place less orders, consume the orders that they placed a year ago for which they do not need to place additional orders because they\u2019re going to be getting actual gear working through deployments. In the meantime, they are engaging with us on future projects, future build-outs. And that gives me a lot of optimism that we will get back to a normal state of affairs in Cloud by the end of this year or, let\u2019s say, early next year. George Notter : Got it. That\u2019s great. And then also, any sense for your lead times? I realize it can vary by product line and SKU. But maybe you have a sense for where lead times were generally back in the summer of last year versus currently, I\u2019d be curious. Thanks a lot. Ken Miller : Yes. So we\u2019ve kind of talked generically that average lead times were kind of in the kind of 9 months range. Some products were actually 12 months or even slightly greater kind of back in the height of the lead time extension, which was about a year ago. Now, we\u2019re seeing on average something less than 6 months, right? We\u2019re seeing, I would say, kind of 4 to 6 months would be kind of a better average. So that\u2019s basically 3-plus months or a full quarter where a customer that was buying consistently quarter in and quarter out, could literally skip a quarter and provide no bookings and still be fine with our new lead times coming in to the degree that they have. Operator : Next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Maybe first question for me somewhat builds on George\u2019s question. Just on -- if you can give a sense of how much of the portfolio is still constrained. I guess I was a little bit surprised that inventory was still a use of cash this quarter. So just when you would expect to kind of be out of an inventory build situation or just able to work down some of the inventory because you\u2019re not constrained on other products? Ken Miller : Yes. So, the inventory constraints are getting lessened. As I mentioned, on average, the amount of constraint is less. That\u2019s why lead times are coming down, our lead times to our customers are coming down fairly materially. So we\u2019re starting to be able to turn inventory quicker. But what you are seeing is the backlog of purchase orders, right? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been tracking our purchase order commitments. A year ago, they were north -- almost $3 billion, $2.8 billion. They\u2019ve come down quite a bit. They\u2019re about $2.3 billion expected this quarter, but we\u2019re still receiving those orders, right? So, we are going to see, I think, inventory plateau in the summer, probably Q2 or Q3. And then, you\u2019ll start to see the outflows of inventory faster than the inflows of the previously committed purchase orders that we, in many cases, put on the books upwards of a year ago because the lead times to our component providers are over a year long. So, you\u2019re seeing that flow through the inventory. Meta Marshall : Great. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You guys had a very sizable cloud win that you announced at least in Q1 of last year. Just trying to get a sense of how much of an additional headwind kind of maybe comping that customer\u2019s initial order, has -- or is that not worth calling out, it\u2019s really this inventory across the board, across your cloud customers? Rami Rahim : Well, all of the wins that we\u2019ve cited in past quarters are meaningful, and they remain important, and they will help us even in the event of some slowdown or push-outs some projects. I mean having the win is still something that we\u2019re very proud of and will help our cloud business. If not, as soon as we expected, maybe a little later, but it will still help. I think beyond that, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Ken Miller : Yes. I think that\u2019s really a bookings commentary, right, where you\u2019re going to see some lumpiness at large cloud on a year ago. They might have had to book 12 months\u2019 worth of demand a year ago because our lead times were what they were. Now they no longer need to book that level of demand. So that could result in some of this normalization we\u2019ve been talking about on the bookings side. On the revenue side, it\u2019s really about timing of supply. I mean you\u2019re going to see ups and downs. You\u2019ve seen in the past quarters, you\u2019ll see it going forward. The revenue decline of 14% for cloud is not what I believe the new norm is going to be. It just is a factor of what we shipped in Q1, and I\u2019m sure it will recover from there going forward. Operator : The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Mike Ng : With plans to exit this year with an elevated backlog and orders to become positive exiting the year, I was just wondering if you could give us some directional expectation around revenue growth for 2024 or discuss some of the key factors you\u2019re considering. Certainly appreciate that it\u2019s early in the year. How much does that backlog burn this year, just make it more challenging to achieve growth for next? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Let me start, and Ken, you probably want to jump in here as well. So I do think that we can grow revenue in 2024. We are not going to provide a number on this call, but certainly, as we get closer, we will provide. And I also do think that we can achieve good profitability in 2024. And the reason for my optimism would be, first, the Enterprise business is now our largest segment and our fastest growing. And I\u2019ve already provided commentary on how bullish I am about Enterprise even in a weaker economic environment. The Cloud provider weakness, I believe, is temporary, and I am a big believer in the growth potential of Cloud in the mid- to long term. Order patterns are going to improve from where we were in Q1. I think we\u2019ve hit a trough in Q1, and we should start to see better order patterns going forward, and still elevated backlog relative to historicals by the end of the year. All of these factors lead me to believe that profitable revenue growth for \u201824 is absolutely possible, and we can do it. Ken Miller : I mean I agree, we did raise the revenue guidance for this year to at least 9%, reflecting really the Q1 overachievement as well as the expectations embedded in Q2. We are comfortable with the second half estimates as they currently are for this year, and we encourage you to keep those estimates unchanged. But that does result in a raise for this year. But that doesn\u2019t come at normalizing backlog completely. We still expect to exit the year at least twice what we would consider to be normal backlog levels, probably greater than double backlog levels. So, that\u2019s something that will also lead into next year as well. Operator : Up next, we have James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Hey guys. Most of mine have been asked. But I did want to ask, you guys raised prices about a year ago now versus kind of the backlog then. It would imply that we should be starting to get a benefit from that price increase on really gross margins now. So why shouldn\u2019t, Ken, we get a bigger gross margin uplift in the back half of the year as a result of this kind of greater backlog flush freeing up that order that would have a higher price to it then? And what are you guys seeing with supply prices in terms of availability as well as the price itself versus the last year? Ken Miller : Yes. So the pricing actions we took over the past couple of years are playing a benefit. If you were to look at our revenue growth this year that we just posted, 2% to 3% of that growth was likely you could attribute to pricing increases. And I think that\u2019s going to roughly be the impact to revenue this full year, roughly 3%, give or take, of our growth of at least 9% would likely be tied to pricing. You\u2019re also seeing that show up in the gross margin line. But just to remind you, our price increase wasn\u2019t intended to recover gross margin. It was really about gross profit. So although gross margin is under pressure, we are offsetting the costs that we\u2019re getting on a one-for-one basis. We\u2019re just -- we\u2019re not creating 60% margin on the cost increases that we\u2019re having to absorb, but we\u2019re actually trying to offset those costs and make them one for one, which does result in margin, not necessarily bouncing back, but it does help the bottom line and obviously EPS. So, as costs were to normalize and we could still hold price, that\u2019s when you would start to see margin expansion because of the actions we took. So far, we\u2019re not seeing supply costs come down materially at all. And maybe there might be a couple of components where you\u2019re seeing some reductions, but for the most part, component pricing are staying fairly stable. We are seeing some good signs on the freight side. I will point out that we did see a reduction in freight costs on a per kilogram basis in Q1, and that was encouraging. So, some of those transitory costs on the freight side, we\u2019re starting to see normalized, but on the other parts of the transitory costs, we have yet to see a meaningful reduction. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : This is Victor in for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you\u2019ve discussed being intentional about taking share in metro edge routing. Can you tell us where you see your current share position and kind of what your targets are longer term? And maybe help us understand the key product differentiators in Juniper\u2019s plan for displacing incumbents like Huawei? Rami Rahim : Yes, certainly. So let me first talk a little bit about the market opportunity because if you look at the Service Provider vertical all up, there are different layers of that network, the layer of the network that, in fact, is growing the fastest from a total addressable market standpoint is the Metro, which is why we think it\u2019s such an interesting area for us. Second, it\u2019s relatively straightforward for Juniper to enter into this market segment because we have great customers that leverage our solutions in the core, in the edge, love our network operating system, Junos, and would love to see us extend that into the Metro layers of their network. In fact, we\u2019ve already seen a number of wins with our ACX portfolio, which is the name of the product family that serves the Metro market as a result of customers just being familiar with and very much liking the operational aspects of our network operating system. In terms of the opportunity, it\u2019s still way more ahead of us than behind us because really the solution is just now coming together. The differentiation has to do with the fact that we\u2019ve really built a sustainable portfolio that\u2019s very power efficient, leverages the latest silicon technology, has certain embedded security capabilities. And very importantly, many of the lessons that we have learned in terms of the operations and automation of a network in our Enterprise segment with our Marvis AI ops engine, we are taking and applying to the Metro. And the customer feedback on that strategy has been phenomenal. So again, I feel really good about this part of the -- this part of our strategy, and I think it can be very successful for us in the future. And that weighs into why I\u2019m somewhat bullish about SP for the year. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. And I think you touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you give us a little insight into the composition of the software? How much is hardware attached versus stand-alone, kind of what are the primary factors driving the demand for the software solutions? Rami Rahim : Well, so software is pretty much an element of every strategic solution we\u2019re selling across our three solution areas, right? In the enterprise, the Mist SaaS software is a necessary component of every solution that we sell across wireless, increasingly wired and WAN. In the data center space, the Apstra is an optional attach. However, it is the way in which we are competing and taking share most effectively in the data center segment today, and I\u2019ve provided some color as to the growth that\u2019s happening with Apstra-led data center wins. In the Service Provider space, this is a software solution we call Paragon that we\u2019re really now sort of putting together, and we are seeing early sales in the Metro. But like I just mentioned, it\u2019s still relatively early days right now in terms of the Metro opportunity. I\u2019m not sure if I addressed your question, but I hope I did. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s good. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. This is Tom Zilberman on for Tal. So going back to backlog, last quarter, your backlog declined between $250 million to $300 million sequentially, and you noted that you expected it to come down, but this quarter it accelerated to $350 million. So, any color on the acceleration of the drawdown versus your expectations 90 days ago? And does it -- and do you think that we can reach that new or that normalized target by the end of this year? Thanks. Ken Miller : Yes. So backlog came down largely in line with our expectations, right? We knew the normalizations of ordering was coming as lead times were coming in and the need to place early orders was effectively gone, and customers are now comfortable consuming previously placed orders and no longer need to place new orders. So we knew that the bookings pattern was largely going to play out the way it did. Supply was also a little bit better than we expected, which is why we beat the Q1 revenue guidance. But we\u2019re talking about an extra $30 million there. So maybe backlog is down about $30 million more than I expected. But overall, it\u2019s pretty much in line with my expectations. I do think it will continue to come down. I do not believe it\u2019s going to be $350 million, give or take, every single quarter. I think as booking starts to normalize, and we\u2019ve been talking about how we think that could start happening throughout this year, starting now, and we actually could return to growth in Q4 and be effectively normal by the end of the year, you will then see backlog moderate. The decline in backlog start to moderate. We expect to exit the year with elevated backlog, not normal, elevated backlog, greater than $800 million, which is more than 2 times kind of our normal backlog levels. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Rami Rahim : So I\u2019ll just end by saying despite the macro challenges that are out there, I remain very confident in the business. This is why we\u2019ve, in fact, increased our 2023 revenue outlook to at least 9%. And also, we are -- we believe that we will deliver over 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. But most importantly, I think that we can achieve sustainable revenue growth and profitability in this business, not just this year, but 2024 and beyond. And thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the second quarter, with total revenue of $1.430 billion, growing 13% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Product revenue grew by 15% year-over-year and we saw year-over-year growth across all geographies. Profitability was also strong in Q2, as our non-GAAP gross and operating margin, both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high-end of our quarterly guidance range. Our Q2 results reflect strong execution by our team, as well as the improvements we're seeing in the availability of supply. We remain confident in our positioning from a technology perspective and our ability to capitalize, as our customers build their networks for the next decade, which we believe will leverage AI powered software automation, an area where we have invested meaningfully over the last few years. We believe these investments, along with our go-to-market focus, will enable us to not only deliver sustained top-line growth, but also improve profitability, even in a challenged end market environment. With respect to demand, total product orders grew nearly double-digits on a sequential basis. And while the year-over-year rate of decline improved relative to last quarter, it was still meaningful due to the strong sequential performance in Q2 2022. While we are continuing to see positive momentum in our Enterprise business, we experienced weaker-than-expected trends with our Cloud and Service Provider customers, which we believe is due to the timing of project and the digestion of prior purchases. Despite these trends, we continue to expect the decline in orders to moderate further over the next few quarters and return to year-over-year growth potentially as soon as Q4 of this year. From a vertical perspective, I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Enterprise business, which delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 45% of our total revenue, representing both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter. Not only did our Enterprise revenue grow by nearly 40% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, our Enterprise product orders also saw healthy year-over-year growth despite a 20%-plus comp in the year-ago period. Importantly, new logos grew by more than 30% year-over-year, which we view as an important forward indicator, given the opportunity to expand after landing many of these accounts. Not to be overlooked, deal registration through the channel and commercial orders both grew by more than 40% year-over-year, which we think speaks to the differentiation of our products and our ability to capture share. Within the Enterprise, our campus and branch business had another record quarter in Q2 with our AI-driven Enterprise revenue growing more than 60% year-over-year. Customers are recognizing Juniper's clear and defensible leadership when it comes to AI driven operations delivered via a modern microservices cloud. While the rest of the industry continues to talk, we have real AI solutions that deliver real results, including a 90% reduction in worldwide trouble ticket at a global software company, 85% fewer store visits by IT at a multinational retailer and the fastest branch network rollout in the history of a national mobile operator. Revenue from the Mistified segment of our business, which are products driven by Mist AI, had a record quarter, growing by nearly a 100% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, with orders growing by nearly 40% year-over-year. Strength was broad across the portfolio with a record wireless, wired and SD-WAN revenue in the quarter, as well as record full stack wins where customers purchase several of these campus and branch products together. We view momentum with these full stack wins as a positive forward-looking indicator, given our belief that for every dollar of wireless, there is $2 to $3 of wired switching and additional SD-WAN opportunity. Marquee new AI-driven Enterprise customers this quarter include a Fortune 10 technology company, a Fortune 50 financial institution, an American supercenter chain, the UK's largest cycling retailer and a multinational manufacturing company. We introduced several new innovations to the Juniper Mist portfolio this past quarter, including the industry's first AI-driven, Cloud-based network Access Assurance solution, which we believe has the ability to revolutionize a very dated NAC industry. In addition, we expanded our AIOps leadership by integrating the Marvis Virtual Network Assistant with ChatGPT for enhanced knowledge-based queries using large language models. And we integrated with a leading Internet collaboration platform for superior video performance. Our Enterprise datacenter business also performed well in Q2, with Apstra reporting a record quarter, both from a revenue and an orders perspective. The Apstra pipeline continues to grow with new logos more than doubling year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter, and we continue to see strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which we view as a positive indicator for our Enterprise data center prospects. Our automation driven data center revenue in the Enterprise posted a record quarter, primarily due to the increasing adoption of Apstra. New Cloud-ready data center wins this quarter include a Fortune 250 financial services firm, a large US restaurant chain and a large US government agency. The performance of our Enterprise business shows our diversification strategy is working and given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow both our Enterprise revenue and orders during the year, even in a more challenged macro-environment. As highlighted over the last few quarters, we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals more closely scrutinizing budgets and project deployment timelines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. This is proving to be particularly true in the Cloud where we're seeing more customers digesting prior purchases and pushing projects to future periods. While these dynamics are likely to pressure our Cloud business for the next few quarters, we remain optimistic regarding our longer-term growth prospects in the Cloud, given our strong wide area footprint, the rapid traffic growth that continues in many of these customer environment and the opportunity to capitalize on the adoption of large language model and the build-out of AI clusters. To this last point, we expect AI adoption to drive a meaningful uptick in traffic growth that is likely to benefit our Cloud wide area footprint over time. However, we also see an attractive data center opportunity emerging, where we believe the performance and power efficiency of our custom silicon, the congestion management capabilities embedded within our Junos operating system and our support for technologies such as RDMA networking will position us well to capture share, particularly with Cloud Major accounts that are likely to bet on Ethernet as the protocol of choice to support their AI cluster investment. In fact, we've already begun to see successes in non-hyperscaler accounts. Our Service Provider business performed as expected in Q2, but moderated on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, following the strong shipments we experienced in the Q1 time frame. We expect this business to remain lumpy going forward, as the continued momentum we're seeing with respect to 400 gig deployments particularly with some of our larger Tier 1 customers is being offset by incremental weakness with Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers that are being impacted by the softer macro-environment. Despite these headwinds, we remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our cloud metro portfolio, where our new ACX7K platform experienced a record quarter, both from a revenue and in orders perspective, and the pipeline of opportunities remains strong. We expect this business to build through the remainder of the year and become more material to revenue in 2024 and beyond. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and optimistic regarding our long-term growth prospects. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued Enterprise momentum and the attractive longer-term opportunities we continue to see in the Cloud, as well as the SP metro opportunity. However, given the digestion of prior purchases and the uncertain timing of customer deployments, particularly amongst some of our larger Cloud customers, we have less visibility and our revenue results are likely to be pressured over the next few quarters. Based on these dynamics, we are reducing our full-year revenue growth forecast. We remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $1.430 billion in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 13% year-over-year. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high-end of our guidance range driven by higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. From a customer solutions perspective, on a year-over-year basis, AI-driven Enterprise led the way with revenue growth of 63%. Automated WAN solutions grew 3% and cloud-ready data center revenue was flat. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 38%; Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud decreased 6%. Total software and related services revenue was $318 million, which was an increase of 49% year-over-year. ARR was $319 million, and grew 37% year-over-year. We were pleased to see nearly 60% year-over-year growth in our SaaS and software license subscription portion of our deferred revenue. We remain confident in our outlook for total software and ARR growth. Total security revenue was $168 million, up 6% year-over-year, due to the timing of shipments related to improved supply. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and one was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 27% of our total revenue as compared to 34% in the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, which was above the midpoint of guidance, primarily driven by favorable software revenue mix and higher revenue volume, partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to headcount-related costs, but were flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.9% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, driven by higher revenue and better-than-expected gross margin. Cash flows from operations were $343 million, which was benefited by approximately $200 million in deferred federal tax payments that will be paid later in the year. We paid $70 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $120 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the second quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion. Despite the challenging macro-environment, our results for Q2 were very strong, and I'm pleased with our team's dedication and commitment. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. For the third quarter, we expect to see continued weakness in orders, particularly with our Cloud and, to a lesser extent, our Service Provider customers. We believe the softness in orders is largely attributable to customer digestion of previously placed orders and certain projects being pushed to future periods. We expect the macro-environment to remain challenged which may continue to impact customer spending. These factors are negatively impacting our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase sequentially in the third quarter 2023. This forecast assumes supply-chain related cost improve but remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our expectations for the rest of 2023. As mentioned previously, we experienced weaker-than-expected order activity in the second-quarter, particularly with our Cloud and to a lesser extent our Service Provider customers. We expect this weakness to continue into the second-half of the year. As such, we are amending our full-year revenue guidance to approximately 5% to 6% growth. However, we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin guidance from approximately 58% to greater than 58% on a full-year basis, primarily driven by anticipated improvements in supply chain costs. Additionally, we still expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion of greater than 100 basis points as the benefit from higher non-GAAP gross margin and prudent non-GAAP operating expense management should offset the impact of lower revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to grow double digits in 2023. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. Finally. I am pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank the Juniper team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to discuss the weakness you called out on the Cloud orders. I'm wondering if you see this as an issue actually stemming from AI projects pulling budget from the areas where Juniper has its use cases. And if so, how do you think about really the timing and extent of the eventual knock-on effect which you mentioned? So I understand AI could be a longer-term tailwind. I'm looking for a little bit more substance on that comment? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Simon. I think the biggest issue right now that we're facing in the Cloud provider segment is the period of digestion. It's not specific to any one customer. It's broad-based It's not even just hyperscalers. It includes the Cloud Major segment as well. To the question around AI and it being a priority, I definitely see it. There is no doubt that our Cloud customers are focusing pretty intensely on artificial intelligence, making sure that they're equipped to deal with the additional services they're going to be offering and the demand that's going to place on their network while in the short term that might have a bit of a negative impact, I think to your point in the long term, it's actually quite attractive for us for two reasons. To the extent that AI is a new killer app that's going to be offered by cloud providers to their customers, it's going to result in an increase of traffic across the board, in areas in the wide area where we have significant footprint and, of course, in the data center. And I do think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that it could offer a nice new opportunity for us to participate in, in the data center with AI clusters being built increasingly over time with Ethernet as an alternative to what is today the technology of choice which is InfiniBand. That said, the timing to your question is -- it's difficult to call right now, but it's really in the several quarters. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Samik Chatterjee : Yep. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I wanted to get a sense, you're trimming your revenue guide for the full year today by about $150 million or so. I mean, the incremental weakness that you're mentioning to the last quarter is Service Provider, but if you can break down sort of how much of that revision on the guide is really coming from Cloud versus Service Providers and maybe just in terms of thinking about sort of the reduction here, I think investors are going to question sort of the discussion or elevated backlog that most companies have discussed for a while just given that even with the elevated backlog, the visibility into revenue remains pretty limited. So how are you guys thinking about sort of backlog in terms of what that backlog implies going forward, particularly given that some of the macro trends are still influencing revenue on a more real time basis? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Sure. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so for the guidance, the reduction in revenue expectation for the year is largely Cloud. Right? I would say to a to a lesser degree, Service Provider, but the vast majority of that reduction would be attributable directly to our Cloud business. On a on a year-to-date basis, our cloud business is down 10%. I think it's likely that it ends the year down double digits. And really due to the weakness we saw in orders late in Q2 as well as what we expect to see for the rest of the year. So the vast majority of that is Cloud. I believe our Service Provider business will stay within kind of our guidance range of plus or minus 2%. So that's going to be largely intact with our long-term model. And Enterprise clearly way ahead of our long-term model and I expect it to remain way ahead as we exit the year. So the revenue decline is really mostly a Cloud phenomenon. From a backlog perspective, clearly backlog is coming down as we expected it to this year. I'll tell you it came down a little bit more than we expected given that the order weakness that we called out in Q2. So backlog is coming down. However, it still remains about 3x, what we would normally expect in kind of a pre-pandemic historical level. And I expect to exit the year -- I still expect to remain elevated as we exit the year at approximately 2x kind of normal historical level. So it's coming down quickly, but it still remains quite elevated. It is going to put some pressure on 2024 revenue growth. The backlog is a tailwind in 2023. It would be a headwind to 2024 at the backlog, but we will not have as elevated backlog entering next year as we did this year. It's going to require us to have a recovery in bookings and orders. The good news is I expect that we will have a recovery in orders. I expect next year to be a strong bookings year for all of our verticals as we kind of go through this backlog digestion period and react to the current lead time. So this year is obviously putting a lot of pressure on bookings. It's resulting in a declining backlog. I think next year would be a little more normal, but bookings will drive revenue growth. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Operator : Up next, we have Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed. Tim, your line is live. Tim Long : Thank you. Yeah. I wanted to touch on the Enterprise business Obviously, good numbers there, still a lot of new customers. Could you talk a little bit about kind of where we're at with kind of win rates, deal sizes, kind of cross selling if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that? And related, if you can just touch on -- we're seeing macro impact a lot of other places. It looks like it's starting or going to start hit that Enterprise networking area soon. How do you view the success you've had in the market share gain in a backdrop where we might be seeing more pressure overall on the industry? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yeah. So I'm obviously very pleased with the performance of our Enterprise business. And really, this is in the face of macro-related headwinds. Enterprise is now our largest, our fastest growing segment in Q2 with over 45% of total revenue. The level of differentiation that we have in our Enterprise portfolio has never been stronger. You see it in the numbers. Our AI driven Enterprise business grew at over 60%, Mistified revenue grew at over approximately 100% year-over-year and we also saw some really encouraging signs with Apstra in the data center, specifically again for the Enterprise. The question around -- really it's around durability. What happens if there were going to be sort of signs of weakness in the market? I'd just say that the Enterprise market if it was -- it's -- there are headwinds in the in the market today. Absent those headwinds, we'd actually be doing even better. We'd be posting even better results than we have right now. And as a -- just a point of consideration, take a look at how our Enterprise business performs even during the early days of the pandemic where peers in the industry were not seeing growth we were seeing growth. And that was through new logos, share taking, which is really happening right now. I'm very encouraged with the forward-looking metrics, things like 30% growth in new logos, deal registration up 40%. This is really an indication of how much opportunity our channel partners are bringing to Juniper, commercial business up at over 40%. This is -- these are signs I believe of success to come in the Enterprise. So for that reason, I'm encouraged by the business traction thus far, revenue growth and order growth this year, and it's I think fairly easy to call revenue growth for next year in the Enterprise. Tim Long : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex, please proceed. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. A couple of just mechanics issues. Can you talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter, pricing in the quarter? Whether the push outs were both in the Cloud and in the Service Provider. And when you talked about the scale of the 24 headwinds, can you give us some sense of what the scale is on that? Is it a 2% headwind, 4%, 6% more? And what's the split there between Enterprise, Service Provider and Cloud? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Maybe I'll start with the 2024 view and then, Ken, I'll let you comment a little bit more about linearity and pricing. And Alex, I appreciate the question. So it's a little too early to provide guidance on 2024 all up, especially given some of the digestion that we're seeing in the cloud and to a lesser extent in the SP segment. However, I do think it is possible for us to grow revenue in 2024, and I'll just walk you through just some of the puts and takes to that. Backlog draws, Ken just mentioned in 2023 creates a pretty meaningful revenue headwind for us in 2024. So if you think about it, orders would need to accelerate from here to overcome the backlog related headwind that this year is presenting to next year. Now the good news is we do expect orders to grow and in fact to accelerate for the full year in \u201824. And in fact, we see the order growth to happen across all customer segments, in Cloud, in SP and in Enterprise. And the Enterprise, as I just mentioned, which is the bulk of our business continues to do well today both from an order and the revenue standpoint, it's very easy to call revenue growth for Enterprise next year. Cloud and SP, I\u2019d just say it's a little bit too early for us to call right now. Orders will accelerate. We don't know if they're going to accelerate fast enough to overcome the backlog related headwinds for next year. So the summary, what I would say is, so while 2024 full year revenue growth is possible, it really is going to depend on the timing of order recovery for Cloud and SP. And I would say, I'm sure Ken would say this if I don't, we're committed to both margin and EPS growth next year in 2024 irrespective of what Cloud and SP does. Ken Miller : Yeah. From a linearity perspective, I'm actually going to answer a couple of things. First from our Q2 orders, the weakness in orders really showed up late in the quarter. So that was something that happened late in the quarter. And our current visibility is that the second half of the year are also going to be down as compared to our previous expectations in the Cloud and to a lesser degree, Service Providers. So it really did kind of show up late in the quarter. I do want to touch on linearity for next year as well. I do believe it's going to be more of a back-end loaded year, a little bit different than, say, this year. So the first half of next year is going to be, I would say, particularly challenged from a growth opportunity perspective. And full year growth is too early to call. It is possible, but there's a lot of moving parts there. But I would set up a back-end loaded year, given the current situation we see and the weakness we see now is likely to bleed into the first half of next year. The other question you asked a little bit on, Alex, was pricing. We really didn't notice a material change in pricing activity. It's always been a very competitive pricing environment. It's kind of deal to deal, hand-to-hand combat in many ways. So it's really nothing to call out from a more holistic point of view on the pricing side. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please proceed. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe, Rami, can I just follow up on the Cloud digestion sort of train of thought here. And how are you thinking about where Juniper kind of fits in or slots in as either the hyperscalers or the major cloud providers really start to accelerate maybe CapEx next year in terms of where you slot in maybe from a timing perspective? And along those lines, are you seeing some of the order digestion or maybe pushouts being driven by maybe a reallocation of CapEx from Cloud customers, whether it's the hyperscalers or main cloud providers? Are they spending more on GPU-enabled servers and compute and maybe that's putting pressure on other parts of network spend? And would you just kind of give some thoughts and color on what you're hearing from your customers at this point? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah, I appreciate the question, David. I think the biggest factor right now that's impacting our Cloud business is digestion. It's just unprecedented order growth over the last couple of years now being followed by a period where they need to work through the products that they've ordered, they need to receive them, they need to deploy them, and then revenue will catch up. Orders -- or recovery in revenue will catch up afterwards. As I mentioned earlier, there definitely is a lot of attention and maybe even some diversion of capital investments to AI clusters, GPUs, that sort of thing. And yes, I think that can have a short-term negative impact, not the biggest impact. Again, it's not as big, I would say, nor as near as big as that -- just of digestion. But the long-term impact of that AI cluster investment, in my view, is a net positive. And this is true for areas of the Cloud provider network where we have significant market share in hyperscale WAN, for example, but it also presents opportunities for Juniper to participate in a AI cluster Ethernet networking, which I believe becomes more dominant in time. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, Rami. Rami Rahim : My pleasure. Operator : Up next, we have Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please proceed. Karl Ackerman : Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I was hoping to tie in or have a follow-up question with regard to some of the comments you asked -- or discussed earlier. One is, I understand that pricing has not really changed yet. At the same time, you indicated that orders were toward the end of the quarter. So I guess are Service Provider and Cloud customers pushing back on price towards the end of the quarter? Is that some of the reason for your cautiousness? And then that's a clarification. I have a short question as well. Ken Miller : Yeah. So just to clarify, I was mentioning that at the end of the quarter orders, the weakness showed up late in the quarter. So actually, our orders were weaker at the end of the quarter than we would have expected as we started the quarter. So linearity was not back-end loaded. In fact, it didn't come in as strong as we thought it would over the last few weeks of the quarter from a bookings perspective. Karl Ackerman : I see. And I was hoping you can just maybe address why hardware maintenance and professional services have moderated the last two quarters despite the improving strength in Enterprise? I suppose, should we expect that to flip going forward? Thank you. Ken Miller : Yeah. So our hardware and maintenance business really is an installed base business. So although current period in revenue and recent period revenue obviously matters, it really is about the installed base. And we have seen significant strength in that business over the last several years, where it's been growing pretty routinely, maybe not as much as product when product is growing well, but it grows -- it still grows even when products has a down period. So it's a pretty stable business that's growing in line with our expectations, to be honest with you. There is a shift happening as well to more software. So when you isolate just hardware maintenance and support, you are kind of underestimating that the true power of our services business, which is on the software side, which shows up in a different line item. Karl Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Up next is George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is live. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. If I go back to last quarter, if I remember correctly, you guys were also pointing to Cloud customers going through a period of inventory digestion. And I guess it seems like it really intensified over the last three months. I guess my question for you is that, is that the right observation? And do you get any commentary from them about why that's intensified? And then also, I just want to make sure this isn't a market share issue. Any sense for market share or your participation share-wise in some of these accounts? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Yeah. So to answer the second part of the question first, no, we do not believe this is a market share issue. Just keep in mind that in hyperscale, our dominant footprint is in the wide area. So it is very much around sort of capital intensity, specifically for wide area investment and so on. The first part of your question, the answer is yes. I mean, it did intensify. We obviously had some expectation of how long the period of digestion would take, how long it would take to deploy new projects and it has elongated. Having said that, it's important to say that projects that we have been working on and competing for remain intact. We have not seen Cloud providers cancel projects. 400-gig deployments in the wide area, for example, remain incredibly important, especially with cloud providers having to invest in new AI capabilities. Ultimately, that's going to generate more demand, traffic growth on their network across every use case. And the projects that were in place might have moved out in time, but they have not been eliminated. And it continues to be an intense area of focus for us at Juniper. George Notter : Got it. And then just a quick follow-on. I know you guys are working on new silicon for the PTX. I'm just curious about where that is. That's obviously, I think, an important new product delivery for Cloud customers. Just wondering where that is. Rami Rahim : Yes. So I mean, it's looking great, honestly. I mean the level of innovation and just the sophistication of the silicon technology that we've developed, and the latest express silicon looks just absolutely remarkable. Customers that have had an early view of what we've developed, are incredibly excited about it. I believe from a market fit standpoint, it absolutely is addressing some of these big cloud provider use cases that I just discussed, and we're getting close. So stay tuned. George Notter : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed, Mike. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just had some follow-ups to your comments on Samik's question on backlog. So you started the year with over $2 billion in the backlog. Are you still expecting to exit the year with backlog levels around $500 million to $1 billion? Any comments on where those net backlog reduction sat in 2023 by customer vertical? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yeah. So we still expect to exit the year on an elevated level, about 2x normal. And we define normal historically as -- we were $400 million plus or minus a bit for quite a period of time. So I'm talking about maybe the middle to the high end of that $500 million to $1 billion range that you talked about, $800 million, plus or minus $100 million or $200 million would be where I'd expect our backlog to exit for the end of the year. So still elevated. To date, it's been coming down fairly proportionately across all verticals. We entered the year with a pretty balanced backlog as compared to what our revenue is. That said, I think we'll exit the year with a little bit more in the Enterprise side, and we'll probably burn through the Cloud backlog at a little faster rate than the other verticals, given some of the weakness that we've mentioned on the new orders. Mike Ng : Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And just a housekeeping question. Orders being up nearly double digits sequentially, my model kind of suggests that implies down mid-20s on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of in the ballpark? Ken Miller : Yeah, we did see a modest improvement from last quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect modest -- we expect improvement going forward. And we could return to growth as soon as Q4. So yes, we are -- we did see some modest improvement. So that's in line, I think, with kind of where you are. Mike Ng : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I noted that you guys were saying that there was some elongation with maybe Tier 2 and Tier 3 Service Providers and Cloud. Those have been areas where you had a lot of new customer wins in the last year. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of -- is this some of the new wins that you had over the last year just taking longer to implement or is it kind of broader across all of the customers within that area? And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of kind of what the overhang on gross margins is still from kind of expedite fees or kind of supply chain costs? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks, Meta. So the period of elongation has been mostly at Cloud, to a lesser extent in SP. You are right, we have won, we've secured new projects over the last year or two that we have mentioned on these earnings calls. And even there, where we have started deployments, some of the deployments have just moved out in time. So it applies to areas where we have existing footprint and net new wins where we've started to see some benefit, but maybe not as much benefit as we would have otherwise enjoyed had these -- had this elongation not taken place. And again, it's mostly a Cloud phenomenon to a lesser extent, in the SP. And then the second part of the question, I'll leave it to Ken on the gross margin. Ken Miller : Yeah. On the gross margin side, we are starting to see some recovery in those costs. I would point to logistics, in particular, that we're seeing some recovery there as well as some of the expedite fees. I still think there's 70 basis points, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, impact to supply constraint costs. So there's still opportunity for it to get better. The other thing I would add is we did call out -- I called out in my prepared remarks, we are seeing some higher inventory-related expenses that were in Q2, and I expect some of those to persist into the second half, but that's been factored into the guidance that we provided on gross margin. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif, your line is live. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my question. And good to see orders growing double digits sequentially. I have a question for Ken, and I apologize, I'm a bit new to covering Juniper. Ken, why provide a full year outlook given Cloud and Service weakness? Is this because of supply chain tightness that you guys saw during COVID, which stretch your lead times? I'm just trying to understand the rationale behind providing the outlook for this year and even commentary into next year. Thank you. Ken Miller : Yes. So with the commentary next year, just to be clear, we are not providing an outlook for 2024. We're trying to provide you with the puts and takes, right? And we do think Enterprise -- that is the one outlook we did provide. We do expect to grow Enterprise next year given the strength of our products and the differentiation we enjoy there. But Cloud and SP, way too early to call, therefore, too early to call the aggregate number. For this year, the rest of it really is just about Q3, what we're providing guidance for and really Q4. And we did provide a range, 5% to 6% for the full year. I do think that's -- based on current visibility, we feel comfortable with that guidance. We still have the elevated backlog that I mentioned earlier. That really does drive a good chunk of the revenue that we're going to recognize for the rest of the year. So it's just really the visibility we have now, we felt comfortable with that type of a range given where we are in the year. Operator : Okay. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James, please proceed. James Fish : Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Look, I know you guys are highlighting digestion and also highlighted Ethernet as the kind of the main protocol over InfiniBand. But Rami, for you, just any updated view why Ethernet will be best for AI workflows? And secondly, given the increased networking demand with AI, is this part of the reason for the optimism for orders to reaccelerate in 2024? And if so, why do you think Juniper's portfolio is best positioned to handle those AI workloads? Rami Rahim : Okay. So the optimism, I would say, is not just rooted in Ethernet being sort of the technology of choice for AI clusters, that's a component of it. But the optimism really is around the fact that traffic growth in Cloud providers continues to grow. Digestion can't happen forever. Eventually, they're going to deplete through their inventory and they're going to -- and Cloud providers are going to need to invest in their networks. To the extent that they invest in the wide area, we will benefit from that just based on our footprint. And then in the data center, as you know, we've got a very good footprint in the top 10 and on the broader cloud majors. And I would add to that, and it's in addition that AI clusters moving to Ethernet would present a net new opportunity for us. And to your question about why Ethernet and not InfiniBand, I mean, obviously, today, most AI clusters are built with InfiniBand. In the future, however, Ethernet present has some distinct advantages. From an economic standpoint, it's got a broader ecosystem. So it's not just Juniper. There will be a number of players. They're going to be innovating in the Ethernet space to capture the requirements of AI clusters. That means from an economic standpoint, customers that want to deploy large language model type clusters are going to benefit economically from moving to Ethernet. But I want to just highlight that this does not happen overnight. This is going to be something that will take several quarters, likely over a year or so, in order for Ethernet to start having a meaningful volume of business tied to AI cluster networking. James Fish : Helpful. And if I could just follow up there on your comments. Any sense as to how much excess inventory the Cloud and Service Providers are holding versus normal? Is it more the inventory issue is on the Cloud side with kind of the deployment issue on the Service Provider side? Or is it kind of the same theme across both? Thanks guys. Rami Rahim : Well, it's mostly a Cloud provider thing. It's to a lesser extent in the Service Provider space Obviously, they're sitting on elevated inventory. When we talk about digestion, really, it means that they are drawing down that inventory and deploying it into their networks. I think your question is really getting to the timing. And we don't know with certainty at this point in time. I can tell you there's going to be several quarters before, as they draw down inventory, do that deployment and they start to see the acceleration -- and we start to see the acceleration of orders again. Operator : Okay. The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed. Tal Liani : Yes. Hi, guys. Sorry to ask third question on the same topic. I just wanted to get the numbers right. Last quarter, you said that backlog was roughly $1.7 billion and the drawdown was about $350 million. This time -- and in the past, you said that the normal backlog is $300 million to $400 million. So this time, you're saying 3 times the backlog. So if I take the $400 million, at high end, it's $1.2 billion, and it means that the backlog drawdown went up from $350 million to $500 million sequentially. But then you're saying that by the end of the year, it will be $800 million to $1 billion. So that means that the -- you expect the backlog drawdown to slow down materially in the next two quarters. Just want to make sure that the numbers that we have are correct? Or if you can give us -- be a little bit more specific with that because I'm sure everyone is doing the same math to understand the backlog drawdown. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yeah, let me add some specificity to the backlog. So we have talked about we ended the last quarter Q2 at approximately 3 times number of levels. We're between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, right? That would be our current backlog position between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. And I do still expect to exit the year at approximately 2 times. I'm using $400 million as my average. So that means approximately $800 million. So currently, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, expect to exit the year at approximately $800 million. That does presume a bit of a slowdown in the second half as compared to the first half. But that's at -- that's obviously based on our expectations of shipments and bookings for the rest of the year. Tal Liani : Got it. on the same topic, but differently, if the weakness is coming -- the order weakness is coming mainly from Cloud and a little bit less than in Service Providers. And on the other hand your Enterprise is very strong. So does it mean that the backlog drawdown is much more meaningful as a percentage of your revenues in these verticals? So I'm just trying to understand if we should assume that the backlog drawdown is mostly tilted towards the Service Providers and Cloud and less to the Enterprise, given the difference in the revenue performance? Ken Miller : Yeah. So I do expect this year, we'll exit with elevated. I think the proportion will be more Enterprise versus how we entered the year, which was more proportional to our revenue. That said, our revenue is also starting to slag much more towards Enterprise as well. So that backlog is getting the bookings growth. So the decline in that backlog is less than the other verticals, which are actually declining on a year-over-year basis from a bookings perspective, revenue is holding up a little bit better, particularly Service Provider revenue, which is up on a first half basis. So yes, we are burning a little bit more in those two verticals as compared to our Enterprise vertical. Tal Liani : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Head of Investor Relations at Juniper. You may begin. Jess Lubert : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami. Rami Rahim : Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the third quarter, with total revenue of $1.5 billion. Better than expected results during the third quarter, with total revenue of $1.398 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Profitability was also strong in Q3, as our non-GAAP growth and operating margins both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60, which was above the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our teams continue to execute well against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment. We remain confident in our positioning from a technology perspective and our ability to win across industry verticals as customers increasingly look to leverage AIOps and software automation tools to improve network operations and reduce overhead costs, what we call experience-first networking. We believe our attention to providing customers with the best user experience, along with our continued go-to-market focus, will position us to deliver healthy, long-term growth and improved profitability. Total product orders came in largely as expected during Q3 and the rate of year-over-year order decline improved as compared to the prior few quarters. Our Enterprise business remained healthy as orders experienced high single digit sequential growth and exceeded our expectations. Enterprise strength helped offset order weakness with our Cloud and Service Provider customers where we continue to see accounts digesting prior purchases before placing new orders. I am extremely encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Enterprise business, which once again delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 50% of total revenue for the first time in Juniper's history. Total Enterprise revenue grew by nearly 40% year-over-year in the Q3 timeframe and represented our largest and fastest growing vertical for a fourth consecutive quarter. Importantly, new logos saw another quarter of healthy double-digit growth, and we continue to see strong mid-market success as enterprise deal registration through the channel grew by more than 20% year-over-year and commercial orders grew by nearly 20% year-over-year. We believe continued growth in new logos and mid-market strength speaks to the differentiation of our products and our ability to capture share. Our campus and branch business had another record quarter in Q3 with our AI-driven enterprise revenue growing more than 40% year-over-year. Revenue from the mystified segment of our business, which consists of products driven by Mist AI, also had a record quarter growing by nearly 100% year-over-year in the Q3 time frame. Our mystified orders also achieved a notable milestone in Q3, surpassing $1 billion run rate on an annualized basis, less than four years after crossing the $100 million run rate milestone in Q4 2019. Customers and the industry are recognizing Juniper's clear and defensible leadership when it comes to AI-driven operations delivered via a modern microservices cloud and the meaningful benefits these solutions can provide in terms of reducing network trouble tickets, automating manual tasks, speeding time to deployment, and reducing mean time to repair as compared to competitive platforms. We see these benefits resulting in share gain opportunities as customers transition from legacy on-prem solutions managed by people to next-gen solutions managed using AI and the cloud. We believe this architectural transition remains in the early innings and will represent attractive growth opportunities for years to come. In Q3, we secured a win with a global pharmaceutical leader, the world's largest healthcare provider added to its Juniper Mist rollout and two very large retailers extended their Juniper Mist network to include our full stack across Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN. One of these retailers is approaching 10,000 locations. Initial demand for our cloud-based network access control product was also strong, securing more than 50 customer wins in a little more than a quarter of availability, with customers highlighting dramatic reductions in rollout time from days to minutes and simplified operations as being key differentiators. Mystified strength was broad-based across the portfolio with record wireless, wired, and SD-WAN revenue in the quarter, as well as record full-stack wins where customers purchased several of these campus and branch products together. We view momentum with these full-stack wins as a positive forward indicator, given our belief that for every dollar of wireless, there is $2 to $3 of wired switching and additional SD-WAN and NAC opportunity. Our Enterprise data center business also performed well in Q3, with Apstra continuing to see strong momentum in the market. Apstra new logos grew by more than 80% year-over-year in Q3, and the pipeline of opportunities remain solid. Hardware pull-through for every dollar of Apstra software has been meaningful and growing, which we view as a positive forward indicator for our data center prospects. Key data center wins in the quarter for Apstra and our QFX switch offerings included large government agencies, international Tier 1 service providers, and one of the largest global appliance manufacturers. The performance of our Enterprise business shows our diversification strategy is working. And given our level of portfolio differentiation balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow our Enterprise revenue and orders in 2023 and 2024, even in a more challenged macro environment. As highlighted over the last few quarters, we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals more closely scrutinizing budget and project deployment timelines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. This has been particularly true in the Cloud vertical, where many of our customers are still in the process of digesting prior purchases. While these dynamics are likely to pressure our Cloud segment for at least the next few quarters, we remain optimistic regarding our longer-term prospects in the cloud. Our optimism is driven by our strong wide-area footprint, the rapid traffic growth that continues in many of these customers' environments and the opportunity to capitalize on the adoption of large language model and the build-out of AI clusters, where we are seeing strong customer engagement that is driving optimism regarding our opportunity to benefit as the industry increasingly considers Ethernet as the right choice for a wide array of AI-ML use cases, including front-end, back-end, in-print and storage networks. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect AI adoption to drive a meaningful uptick in traffic growth that is likely to benefit our cloud wide-area footprint over time. We also remain optimistic regarding our AI data center switching opportunity, but we are already seeing success with cloud major and enterprise accounts due to the performance and power efficiency of our custom silicon, the congestion management capabilities embedded within our Junos operating system and our support for technologies such as RDMA networking. Additionally, by incorporating Apstra in our AIML design, Juniper differentiates in its ability to deliver the turnkey deployment and reliable operations of AI-ML clusters, which is critical to achieving the performance goals required by AI-ML team. Our Service Provider business softened in Q3 and was impacted by some of the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. These dynamics are causing many carriers to more closely scrutinize budgets and, in some case, to run their networks harder than planned. We found this to be particularly true amongst our Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers as well as certain large international accounts, while activity with the US Tier 1 operators has largely tracked according to plan. Despite these macro headwinds, we remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Cloud Metro portfolio where our new ACX7000 platform had a record revenue quarter and saw solid year-over-year growth from an orders perspective. These products secured six new footprint wins in the Q3 timeframe, including a win with an international Tier 1 account. We expect this business to build through the remainder of the year and become more material to revenue in the 2024 timeframe and beyond. I'd like to highlight that our services team continued to execute extremely well and delivered another quarter of record revenue and margins during the Q3 timeframe. Services accounts were more than 35% of our total revenue and we believe represents an underappreciated aspect of the business that is not only recurring and likely to grow in the years to come, but it also presents opportunities for margin expansion as the team continues to identify and capture efficiencies. In summary, while the macro environment remains uncertain and is impacting our near-term outlook, I remain confident with our strategy and optimistic regarding our long-term growth prospects. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued enterprise momentum and the attractive longer-term opportunities we continue to see in the Cloud as well as Service Provider metro opportunity. I'd also like to emphasize that we remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in 2023. We also expect further improvement in 2024. While we view revenue growth as the primary lever to achieving improved profitability and reducing costs is never easy, we recently announced an action to protect profitability while preserving investments in strategic areas of the company. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results and outlook in more detail. Ken Miller : Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2023 with $1.398 billion in revenue, which was over $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60, which was $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected revenue results and improved gross and operating margins. Total product orders came in largely as expected, and the rate of year-over-year decline improved as compared to the prior few quarters. Enterprise demand continues to be strong and exceeded our expectations, resulting in orders that grew in the high single-digits on a sequential basis but were approximately flat year-over-year. Cloud and Service Provider demand remained pressured due to digestion of previously placed orders and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment. From a customer solution perspective, on a year-over-year basis, AI-driven enterprise led the way with record revenue and growth of 43%. Automated WAN solutions revenue declined 18%, and cloud-ready data center revenue declined 26%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 37%, Service Provider declined 20%, and Cloud decreased 28%. Total software and related services revenue was $313 million, which was an increase of 27% year-over-year. ARR was $357 million and grew 37% year-over-year. Deferred revenue from our SaaS business grew more than 50% year-over-year. We remain confident in our software transformation and ARR growth. Total Security revenue was $160 million, up 14% year-over-year. Our services business remained strong in Q3, posting record revenue and profitability. Service revenue was $500 million and grew 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 72.8% improved 4.8 points versus a year ago and 3.1 points sequentially. We see the potential for continued services revenue growth and improvements in profitability. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, three were Enterprise and two were Service Providers. Our top 10 customers accounted for 29% of total revenue as compared to 34% in the third quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.5%, which was at the high end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by the improved service margin, favorable software revenue mix and lower logistics costs, which was partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to headcount-related costs but were down 1% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected gross margin. Cash flows from operations were $329 million. We paid $70 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the third quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments increasing to $1.4 billion. Lastly, we incurred an aggregate amount of $62.5 million in restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the plans to reallocate resources to efficiently support our strategic priorities while delivering against our profitability goals. As disclosed in an 8-K filed earlier this month, we announced a plan to reduce worldwide head count by approximately 440 employees, resulting in the majority of this restructuring charge. Please reference our SEC filings for more information. Overall, we delivered solid results in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our team's dedication and commitment. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. The macroeconomic environment is expected to remain challenged, which has been factored into our outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect to see sequential growth in bookings and expect the rate of year-over-year order declines to further moderate. We continue to see healthy Enterprise momentum and expect orders to grow both in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. However, we expect demand from Cloud and Service Provider customers to remain constrained as they continue to digest previously placed orders. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase in the fourth quarter of 2023 to approximately 60% due to expected lower supply chain costs. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline of approximately $10 million. With our fourth quarter guidance, total 2023 revenue is expected to grow approximately 5% to 6% on a full year basis, and non-GAAP operating margin will expand by more than 100 basis points. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to grow double digits in 2023, meeting our previously stated guidance for revenue and profitability. While the current global macroeconomic environment poses some uncertainty, we would like to provide some initial color regarding our current outlook for 2024. Bookings across all verticals are expected to grow next year on a full year basis. We expect our Enterprise revenue to grow. However, total revenue results will depend on the rate and pace of recovery in our Cloud and Service Provider verticals, which remain uncertain at this time. Based on our current order expectations and backlog levels, we expect a return to more traditional seasonal revenue patterns beginning in the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder, prior to the industry-wide supply chain shortage, we historically experienced double-digit sequential revenue declines in the first quarter followed by sequential revenue growth throughout the remainder of the year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to expand in 2024. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2024. However, our ability to achieve this objective will be partially dependent on revenue results. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I'd like to thank the Juniper team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit, your line is live. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Good job on the [Technical Difficulty]. Fairly impressive. My question is really around the weakness you're seeing on the Cloud and Service Provider market in aggregate. I'm really curious if you've seen any change in tone over the last 90 days because a lot of the stuff [Technical Difficulty] as well. And maybe across both the segments, is your sense that the weakness is coming more from customers having to digest the product they already have? Or is it more a pushing out new deployments? I'm curious how this starts across the segments. And then maybe related to this [Technical Difficulty], from a historical perspective, how long do you think these corrections typically last and perhaps that answers a little easy on Service Provider versus Cloud, but I am not sure what the historical perspective looks. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Hi, Amit. This is Rami. I'll start. For some reason, you're really choppy. So I hope the issue is not on our end. I think I caught most of what you asked really around the demand environment that we're seeing for Cloud and SP, and I think you're looking for some commentary around sort of the duration of that -- the challenges that we're seeing in that segment. I'd say, first, not much has changed from the last quarter in terms of what we're seeing in SP and Cloud. Service Provider is probably incrementally more challenging. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, not so much because of Tier 1 service providers in the US, more about Tier 2, Tier 3 and international. Cloud is challenging as we expected. I don't think it's gotten worse or better, really. And we've always expected that the digestion period that is being faced in the Cloud and, to some extent, in the Service Provider vertical as well, is going to last for several quarters. Having said that, I don't think it's all negative. I mean in the Service Provider space, for example, there are plenty of opportunities out there that we're competing for, especially in the metro, where we're seeing really great early momentum. And I expect that that's going to more meaningfully contribute to our top line next year. In the cloud provider space, there are projects that are ongoing. We're competing for new projects for certain. The AI cluster opportunity is going to emerge, as I think, a wonderful opportunity for us to go and to pursue. I just think it's going to be a few more quarters of digestion before those opportunities start to play out and we begin to benefit from them. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is live. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit more around the strength in hardware, maintenance and professional services. Very good quarter-on-quarter growth. Was there something that may have helped on the maintenance side, whether it's the incremental challenges in SP that you talked about that may have led to more maintenance? And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about product orders. It's encouraging to hear that it was in line with expectations and the year-over-year decline improved. But how much did product orders actually decline in the quarter? Thank you. Ken Miller : Yeah. So I'll take those questions. So on the services side, very proud of the team. And we've seen some record services result both on the revenue side, up 12% year-on-year, as well as on the margin side. So really phenomenal results there. The services business does include predominantly our maintenance professional services business, but it does include a growing portion of our SaaS software, which has been growing faster than the overall services results. So the SaaS business is absolutely helping services overall. But as you look at just the maintenance business, which is what you talked about and the growth there, really, there's a lagging indicator of what we've seen in the past couple of years on the product side. So the product growth over the last couple of years has really given us the opportunity to expand our installed base and to attach more service contracts, and we're realizing the benefit of that now. So that's been great. On the product booking side and the order side, it did come in as we expected. Enterprise was maybe a little more favorable than we originally anticipated at the start of the quarter. Service Provider was a little bit weaker than we anticipated, but in aggregate, it was as expected. And as we predicted, we are starting to lessen that year-over-year decline that we've had the last couple of quarters, and I expect us to further lessen that decline here in the fourth quarter. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is live. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess if I start on the margin front, you're guiding to operating margin expansion, although with the sort of caveat about what that revenue outlook looks like. I do see you sort of expanding gross margins next year. So can you just outline what is sort of the sort of puts and takes here? What is the amount of revenue decline you can absorb even with gross margin expansion and still sort of deliver operating margin expansion as you look to next year? And just a quick clarification on Michael's question here. So you said orders have tracked in the quarter largely in line, but you seem to be moderating your 4Q order trajectory of saying now it's maybe a more modest decline where earlier you were saying it's an increase as of the last quarter. So there seems to have been an incremental change there even though it tracked in line in the quarter. So can you just clarify what led to that change? Thank you. Ken Miller : Absolutely. So this is Ken. On the margin expansion for next year, which we are anticipating, we are going to -- we are expecting a gross margin improvement next year. We also -- we will be -- continue to be prudent on cost controls. So with the gross margin expansion as well as the prudence on cost controls, we do believe we will expand operating margin. That really would apply to revenue at, say, modest decline levels. If revenue declines were to get larger than that, it would be more challenging. But we would stay laser-focused on protecting profitability. And if necessary, we would consider taking further costs out of the business to protect our margins. On the Q4 order perspective, you're right, in prior quarters, we did mention we thought we will return to year-on-year growth potentially as soon as Q4. We still might return to year-on-year growth in Q4. Quite confident that the year-on-year decline, if there is one, will be significantly lessened from the last couple of quarters. But we may return to year-on-year growth in Q4, but it's not factored into my current base case. I do expect us to return to full year growth or year-over-year growth in 2024, early in 2024. And on a full year basis, in 2024, I would expect all verticals to have full year growth. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex, your line is live. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could give us some sense of when you think some things are going to normalize. And most specifically, the -- at what juncture do you think your backlog is fully normalized? And at what juncture do you think your excess inventory will normalize? I assume that's with a lag to the backlog. And do you think that there's any risk within that inventory as we're going through these delays and changing environment? Is there anything in your inventory that you think might be an obsolescence problem? Thanks. Ken Miller : Good questions. On the backlog front, backlog has come down faster or normalized faster than we expected this year largely because the supply chain has actually improved much quicker than we expected from a lead time perspective. So we have seen backlog come down. I expect it to continue to come down in the fourth quarter as well. I still believe we will remain -- we'll exit the year at an elevated backlog position. But at this point, I do not believe it will be two times the elevated position that we've been talking about in prior periods. So I think it will be elevated but not quite two times. I do expect backlog to fully normalize probably by the middle of next year. I would say probably the first half to the middle of next year, backlog should be kind of fully normalized. Inventory has been growing throughout the last couple of years. I would expect this to plateau and start to come down at some point in 2024. It is going to take longer. To your point, the inventory kind of normalization, if you will, it's going to take a few years, in my opinion. And I don't think we'll ever get down to previous normals, right? I think we've learned some lessons with the recent supply chain situation. I think we'll continue to carry inventory at higher levels than we historically did, but there is still a fairly sizable room for it to reduce over the next few years. And on the cost of that inventory, there are costs. I mean I mentioned in the gross margin guidance, we had a very strong gross margin quarter really highlighted by software, services. And we are seeing some of the earlier transitory costs, i.e. logistics and expedite fees come down. But some of the goodness in gross margin was offset by an increase in inventory-carrying charges. That would include excess and obsolescence reserves as well as just carrying charges. So we are paying for those now. That's factored in, obviously, to our results and to our near-term and longer-term guidance. I do think there's opportunity for those to reduce over time as inventory starts to normalize. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon, your line is live. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification, if I might. In your prepared remarks, you talked about a return to normal seasonality in 2024, and you also make a reference to Q1 being down double digits in the past. Are we to take it that you expect Q1 '24 to be down by a double-digit rate? That's the clarification, simple. In terms of the broader question, however, I see a number of the third-party market research firms expect the campus environment, both wireless LAN and campus switching, will decline in 2024. And you've been experiencing some good growth here. I assume it's decelerating, but you sound very confident that you'll still grow. Could you help us unpack what separates your view from the market research firms? Thank you. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the question, Simon. I'll start with your second question first, and I'll then hand it over to Ken. So first, you're right, I am confident in our campus and branch business. We have grown over the last few years even in the face of pretty significant headwinds. At a time when, for example, the middle of COVID where some of our peers were seeing some declines, we consistently saw growth in our campus and branch business. I think the solutions that we're offering that include AIOps that simplify and reduce the cost of operations actually truly resonate with customers that are looking for executing on digital transformation projects in a situation where their budgets are challenged, right? We're basically enabling them to transform their business with less total cost of ownership. That's part of the value proposition of our solutions that's really resonating. In addition to that, the campus and branch market all up if you include wired, wireless and WAN is a $25 billion market opportunity, give or take, of which we're a small player and plenty of room for us to grow, even in the face of a total addressable market that's not growing all that much or even not even growing at all. So for all of these reasons, I'm super optimistic about our Enterprise business and especially our campus and branch business moving forward. Ken Miller : Yeah. And on your clarification question, the short answer is yes, I would expect a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 in that double-digit realm based on kind of previous traditional patterns. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. David, your line is live. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to kind of bundle a couple of things here, all related, if you may -- if you let me. So I'm trying to understand sort of the seasonal patterns of the business that you referenced going into Q1 and then sequentially getting stronger because the business is a little bit different today than it was pre-COVID, right? Mist is much stronger, and I would imagine the severity of the decline in cloud is much deeper than you would have anticipated. So I guess the first question is, does the normal seasonal patterns hold? Or is there some sort of variability around the normal seasonal patterns in the years prior to COVID? And then in conjunction with that, I think you said backlog should get normalized by the end of the second quarter. Does that mean you're expecting roughly $300 million, $400 million, maybe $500 million of revenue from backlog in the first half of 2024 to show up as revenue? And then I have a follow-up. Ken Miller : Yeah. So I'll address the seasonal pattern one. We do expect the double-digit decline Q4 to Q1 as we mentioned. And then from there, we expect sequential growth throughout the rest of the quarter. I would say we've talked a lot about revenue next year was uncertain predominantly because it's just unclear about the pace and timing -- the size and timing of the recovery within Cloud and SP. So that implies to me that we expect it to recover at some point next year but just not exactly sure when. And when that does, that should accelerate revenue. So I would expect revenue to be maybe a bit more back-end loaded, probably closest traditional patterns this last year 2023 or this year. 2023 was not kind of a sequential growth quarter. It was kind of a flattish quarter from a quarter-to-quarter perspective throughout the year. Next year, I think we'll start down and it will build back up as the year progresses. David Vogt : And then on the backlog because it sounds like it's going to be normal after the end of the second quarter. So that sounds like it would be a pretty healthy tailwind despite sort of the commentary for sequential pressure in the first quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that. Ken Miller : Yes. So backlog continues to be a bit of a tailwind in each of our quarters, but it's lessening quarter after quarter as it starts to normalize. So not giving any specific guidance other than I do expect it to remain elevated as we exit the year but not to the degree that we previously thought. We were thinking it was going to be two times previous kind of historical levels. We now think it will be less than that but still be above historical levels. David Vogt : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. George, your line is live. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to dig in on gross margin a bit more. Could you walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin? I guess I'm thinking more about some of the impacts on the supply chain crunch. It sounds like -- I imagine there's certainly high-cost componentry that's running through the gross margin line right now. Also, it sounds like there's some breakdown associated with excess and obsolete inventory here as well. I guess, can you give us a sense for how big those components are in terms of their impact on gross margin? Ken Miller : Yeah. So I mean we are seeing -- we're definitely seeing some improvements in what we used to refer to as the transitory costs, right? These were predominantly logistics costs and expedite fees or purchase price variance fees, where we're paying more just to get a hold of the product that was scarce, hard to get. We clearly are not paying any more of those fees as we are able to get products pretty much on time with standard lead times at this point. The supply chain has completely normalized from a lead time perspective. But we do still have some inventory that we bought at prior higher prices, as you mentioned, and that's going to bleed through over the next few quarters. But each quarter, we're getting more and more of that benefit or less and less of those additional fees on the expedite side. Logistics has effectively recovered completely, right, where the logistics cost that we were paying -- the elevated logistics costs have completely normalized. And that's obviously benefiting our current gross margin results and our expectations going forward. The one area that has gone negative, if you will, or have gotten worse over the last 12 months are those inventory carrying fees that I mentioned. And that's really just a factor of the balance sheet and inventory that we're carrying. So I would expect those costs to remain for the next few quarters higher-than-normal levels as inventory remains higher-than-normal levels, but I do see a path to recovery on those as well. All this is factored into our guidance, obviously, for Q4 as well as our expectation that next year, we expect to grow gross margin. George Notter : Got it. Okay. That helps. And then also back to the services gross margin strength this quarter, I guess, I'm just curious for more detail on what drove that strength. It sounds like it was probably the SaaS business. But that services gross margin really did step function up in Q3. I guess I'm wondering exactly if that was the driver or there's other things at work there. Thanks. Ken Miller : Yeah. The revenue -- SaaS was definitely a part of it and has been a continual part of it for the last few years as SaaS is becoming a bigger part of our overall business. we disclosed on the call, our ARR business at $357 million at an all-time high and growing quite nicely. So that is becoming a bigger factor of overall services. However, I don't want to discount the maintenance business, which also grew nicely in the quarter and the efficiencies we're getting within our services organization. So really, this is a situation of revenue growth and cost of revenue decline, and that's resulting in the margin expansion that you're seeing. George Notter : Got it. One last one. Is it fair to say there's no one-time items driving that gross margin this quarter that's related baseline that you should continue to kind of move off of going forward? Is that fair to say? Ken Miller : I think it's fair to say that directionally, we should be moving up as we move forward. Any given quarter, you might see some small anomalies, but I do feel good about the ability to continue to grow gross margin in a more of an aggregate time period basis. George Notter : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler. James, your line is live. James Fish : Hey guys. Kind of working back on Simon's question before on Mist. It's been a huge behemoth. We constantly hear the need to upgrade wireless LAN due to specifically going back to work, actually, and all of us having Zoom and Teams meetings still actually in the office with those that are not in the office. Those apps obviously are showing bandwidth improvements. And we've been seeing the strength in wireless LAN for a while now. And really the core of this, Rami, is how much more is left in this business from a -- let's separate the market perspective, as Simon pointed out, like the decline potentially for next year versus the outright share gains. What do you see left in the pipeline and opportunity? And Ken, just for you, I mean, just round out this discussion, prior to the supply chain glut and as you guys matured, it looked like you averaged about 12% to 14% declines in Q1. And Q1s have been about 22% to 23% of your year. That kind of backs me into about a 2% decline for next year. And I know you're not going to less that number necessarily, but you're talking about orders growing, as you said. So I guess, what kind of order of magnitude are you looking for, for growth? And are you thinking of it as low single-digit decline for next year is the way we should be modeling? Thanks guys. Rami Rahim : Okay. Let me start with your first question. And Ken, I'll let you talk a little bit more about the commentary for next year. So I'll address the Mist question from both the standpoint and sort of market dynamics and then what's happening with our business more specifically. From a market dynamic standpoint, I think it's really important to understand that the -- if you look at the campus and branch market all up, that's sort of a slow, maybe flattish-type market opportunity. Within the campus and branch market, there's actually a segment really ran cloud-managed. These are basically enterprise solutions where the control and the management of that solution is really done through the cloud. And that part of the market is actually growing at a healthy clip, and I expect that it will continue to grow through next year as well. And that is the opportunity that we are entirely focused on, at least when it comes to campus and branch. Every single one of our access point is connected to the cloud, managed through the cloud with an AIOps engine, Marvis in the cloud. And all of the growth that we're seeing now in the wired switching as well as in the WAN is happening through the cloud. And even the security capabilities, such as network access control that we've introduced, is a cloud-based solution as well. So I think it's a little bit -- it's wrong to look at the growth of just the campus and branch market all up. It's actually more useful to look at it from the standpoint of that cloud-connected portion of the market that's actually growing at a much faster clip. Then in terms of the solution itself, really, when it comes to harnessing the power of AIOps, and I know it's a bit of a used and abused words out there. I mean the proof is in the pudding. Our customers today are seeing real benefits. Reduction in number of tickets by 90-plus percent, reduction in total -- the time frame it takes to deploy a new solution from what used to be a year to a matter of weeks, if not maybe a month or so. The root cause analysis that used to take days with all of the frustration of people that are trying to use the network to do whatever they want to do has been reduced to essentially no time at all because most of the time, we're proactively identifying issues and fixing them. You mentioned Zoom. We have already integrated Zoom visibility into our Mist solutions so that when there is, in fact, some sort of a video issue, we can, if not proactively, instantly provide the IT staff visibility into whether the issue is more in the application side, the wireless side, the wired side, the cloud, et cetera. And that's the capability that our IT customers are really, really happy to see. So I know I'm maybe beating a little bit of a dead horse here. I'm very optimistic about the competitiveness of our solutions in the market, whether it be a challenged market or not. Ken Miller : And when it comes to 2024 revenue growth, it's a little too early to provide guidance for 2024, particularly with some of the weakness we're seeing with the Cloud and Service Provider customers. But let me walk you through some of the puts and takes. I mean, clearly, the backlog drawdown that we're going through in 2023 is going to provide a pretty significant headwind to revenue in 2024. Orders are going to need to accelerate just to offset some of that backlog-related headwind that we're experiencing from a revenue perspective in 2023. With that said, I do expect orders to accelerate in 2024. I expect full year growth across all of our verticals. I also expect Enterprise revenue to grow in 2024 on a full year basis. So really it comes down to Cloud and SP and the timing and pace of that recovery. And that's a little bit too early to call at this point. So we're not giving specific guidance on 2024 other than based on the backlog expectations and our order expectations in Q1, we do expect to see a return to more traditional patterns. James Fish : Very helpful color guys. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Karl, your line is live. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. I have two questions. Rami, perhaps a question for you to start. So the upside in the quarter appears to be on the services side, while product growth is going the other way. I understand there is a mix dynamic at play on services given the growth that the company is seeing in Enterprise. But where do you think we are in the cycle for Service Provider and Cloud spending on product hardware? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So Cloud and SP, as I mentioned, they're definitely going through a period of digestion after they -- for the last couple of years, have bought a lot of equipment. I mean, if you recall, in the Cloud Provider segment for us or vertical for us, there were a few quarters where their order growth was in the 100% year-over-year sort of range. So the fact that they're going to take some time to go and to consume that inventory to deploy it is as expected. And this is also happening within the SP space as well. The other thing that I can say is, if you look at these businesses over the years, there have been ebbs and flows. They have always been lumpy. And I do not believe that there's anything structural that is happening right now in either the SP space or the cloud space that would suggest that this is the new normal. I expect that they will both bounce back. And as Ken mentioned, orders in both of these verticals will recover next year. In terms of the timing, the time frame, it's difficult to say. All I can tell you at this point is that it's going to take a few more quarters of digestion before we start to see a meaningful recovery, meaningful rebound, but I'm optimistic it's going to come. And maybe the last thing I would say is the following. It's the very fact that these verticals, Cloud and Service Providers, have traditionally been lumpy that we, several years ago, decided very strategically, very deliberately to pursue the Enterprise and to diversify our business into the Enterprise. And it is, in fact, now the Enterprise, which, for the first time in our history, represents over 50% of our revenue this past quarter is giving us the resilience that we need to weather challenges in SP and Cloud. Those challenges are going to go away. It's not going to be the new normal, as I mentioned. And eventually, we'll have the benefit of a rebounding SP and Cloud business in addition to an Enterprise business that I believe will continue to perform well without all of the typical gyrations of the business that we have endured in SP and Cloud historically. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is live. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is for Rami. Rami, in your prepared remarks, you sounded quite instructive on the Ethernet adoption for AI clusters. You talked about front-end, back-end, infill storage. Can you talk about the timing of the Ethernet adoption? Is this something like 2025 event? Or are you seeing rail pilot or volume rollout? Rami Rahim : Yeah. So I'm actually quite bullish about the AI cluster opportunity. As I mentioned in the last call, I think we all have to acknowledge that today, the technology of choice for connectivity between GPUs and either inference or learning clusters is InfiniBand. It's not Ethernet. However, the momentum behind Ethernet in the industry is very strong. And so I believe it is a matter of time before Ethernet reigns as the fabric technology of choice in AI clusters. And I do believe this will present opportunities for us. In terms of timing, I think next year, 2024, maybe closer to the second half of the year and in particular, what we're seeing, especially among the cloud majors customers for us, there are a lot of projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there where we are being asked. There have been some good technical dialogue about how we move Ethernet to become sort of that cluster technology of choice for either learning or inference for their solutions. And in fact, even large enterprises, we're seeing that more and more large enterprises, financial services, insurance companies, even healthcare, they're pursuing these private clusters. All up, I'm optimistic about the opportunity. I like how we stack up from a technology standpoint with the combination of our customer and merchant silicon, our Junos operating system feature that we developed specifically for the Ethernet cluster solution and Apstra, which provides the automation and the visibility into it, Ethernet AI cluster solution, that gives me good optimism for capturing our fair share, if not more, in this market opportunity. Atif Malik : Great. And then, Ken, when you guys talk about your Enterprise revenues to grow next year, is that growth mostly attributable to the market share? Or are you seeing the overall market also grow for Enterprise? Ken Miller : Yeah. So I expect our Enterprise revenue -- I expect our Enterprise business to grow faster than market. So I do think we will take market share. The market, as many are predicting, is expected to slow down pretty significantly next year as compared to this year, but we expect to be able to grow -- even if the market is slightly down, we would expect to grow our Enterprise business. So we are absolutely expecting market share taking. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe first question, I know on the Enterprise side, you guys are not as tied to macro just given kind of the share gain position you're in. But just wanted to get a sense of any commentary around time from initial Wi-Fi sales to kind of the upsell of additional campus switching or additional SD-WAN, just whether you're seeing an elongation of that in a more challenged macro or if it's actually shorter just given the compelling ROI. And then maybe just as a second question, just the visibility. As we've kind of extended this inventory digestion period on Cloud and Service Provider, just the visibility that you have within those customers of just how much inventory they have. What is kind of the ongoing dialogue to get a sense of just when you guys could have a little bit more sense of visibility there? Thanks. Rami Rahim : Thanks for the questions, Meta. So let me start with the first one on macro, and I think specifically the timing between sort of initial sale of a Mist solution to subsequent use cases. It honestly is all over the map. We have seen accounts that have traditionally been Wi-Fi customers have loved the technology, the ease of operations and years later, have come back to us saying, hey, we'd like to introduce wired, WAN, et cetera. But in many cases, we're actually selling the full technology stack day one. In fact, we are deliberately tracking sales of full-stack solutions, and we hit a record -- another record in Q3, where a full-stack solution would be some combination of use cases, wired and wireless, wired and WAN, wireless and WAN, et cetera. And we're continuously adding more and more of these capabilities, an example of which would be the NAC, network access control, where in the Q3 time frame alone, we added around 15 new customers and it's starting to grow quite rapidly. We're incenting our sellers to cross-sell. We're enabling them to cross-sell. It's definitely part of our sales motion. On the visibility, I guess, it really goes back to the question I just answered recently. It's difficult to know exactly how much inventory levels our customers have, but we do know that, at least for the next few quarters in both SP and Cloud, their focus is going to be on deploying what they have bought -- first receiving what they have bought, deploying it, getting it up and running before they start to feel the need to make meaningful orders again. It's just going to be measured in a few quarters. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal, your line is live. Tal Liani : Yes. Hey. Two questions. Number one is the Cloud decline -- Cloud vertical declined 28% this year -- this quarter. Can you tell us what's the basis for the decline? Is it the absorption of historical orders? Or is it delays of projects? Or what's kind of the basis? That's number one. And number two, the Enterprise vertical, this is the fourth quarter of very, very strong growth, 37%. And if I look back, it's four quarters that you doubled the growth from the previous four quarters. And the question is the same, more or less, here. What is driving it? And then once we get to next quarter and the following four quarters, the comps are very tough. What do you think is going to happen to the growth rate? And again, I'm asking qualitatively just to understand what's driving it. Thanks. Rami Rahim : Okay. Thanks for the questions, Tal. Let's start with Cloud Providers. The biggest thing driving the decline today is the fact that lead times have gone from what was over a year to normal, just a few weeks. And so the need for them to purchase in sort of like way upfront from when their needs are is just not there anymore. And therefore, they've just reduced the orders that they're placing. So that is the number one thing that's affecting our business. It's not the only thing. There are definitely -- there have definitely been some project pushouts. I think macro has affected their own businesses and the need for equipment. So that would be the second thing. And I think the other thing is they have shifted some of their priorities to, for example, AI, GPUs, which, as you know, are extremely expensive. So those are the main reasons. I again feel the need to reiterate : I'm optimistic long term. I do believe that nothing has changed structurally, and I believe that I would not bet against the businesses of Cloud Providers. And therefore, it remains an incredibly important and strategic part of our business. It's just going to be a matter of time before we start to see the rebound in the recovery there. In Enterprise, yes, we have seen and I believe we'll continue to see strength. I've talked at length about Mist. So I'd be remiss not to mention also what's happening in our data center business. We had record Apstra revenue. Each Apstra sale, which is our automation solution for the data center, intent-based automation solution, is pulling meaningful hardware at this point in time. Apstra new logos have grown by 80% on a year-over-year basis, and the pipeline remains incredibly solid. Next year, the compares become more difficult in the Enterprise, no doubt. And this backlog draw in 2023 that Ken and I have both mentioned does affect Enterprise as well. It's just that in the Enterprise space, orders continue to be very robust, and we expect order growth next year. So the path to revenue growth next year is much clearer. But obviously, yeah, it becomes more difficult from a year-over-year standpoint. So you should just factor that into your model. Tal Liani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That was all the questions we had today, and that does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
